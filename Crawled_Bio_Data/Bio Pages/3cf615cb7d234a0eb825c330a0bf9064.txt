are employing a broad combination of genomic genetic biochemical biophysical and embryological approaches in number of cellular and organismal models to investigate functions of the parts of the genome understand regulatory mechanisms underlying cellular plasticity and differentiation investigate how quantitative changes in gene expression dictate differences in human traits and study craniofacial development evolution and OF LONG RANGE GENE REGULATIONCentral to the cell transcriptional regulation are distal elements called enhancers canonically defined as short noncoding DNA sequences that act to drive transcription independent of their relative distance location or orientation to their cognate promoter A major area of investigation in our laboratory is focused on general mechanisms of gene regulation by enhancers which can activate their target genes over tens of even hundreds of kilobases of genomic distances We are striving to understand how enhancers are activated in response to developmental stimuli how they communicate with target promoters what is the dynamics of this process in living cells and what is the role of chromatin context in priming or restricting enhancer activity HUMAN NEURAL CREST DEVELOPMENT DISEASE AND EVOLUTIONOur laboratory uses Cranial Neural Crest Cells CNCCs as a paradigm to study how genetic information harbored by regulatory elements is decoded into a diversity of functions behaviors and morphologies CNCCs are a transient embryonic cell group which delaminates from the neural tube migrates long distances and acquires an extraordinarily broad differentiation potential ultimately giving rise to most of the craniofacial structures and determining their individual and variation Over a third of human congenital malformations is linked to CNCC dysfunction including over 700 syndromes with craniofacial manifestations The goal of our ongoing research effort is to understand how variation in gene expression translates into differences in CNCC behavior leading to the emergence of and morphological diversity in the craniofacial form This gene expression variation can result both from the differences such as those associated with mutations of transcriptional and chromatin regulators in craniofacial syndromes and from the variation in sequences like enhancers To understand both mechanisms of variation and their cell type specificity we are using human pluripotent stem cell differentiation models that recapitulate induction migration and differentiation of CNCCs in the dish and facilitate modeling of human neurocristopathies To study impact of regulatory changes on facial morphology we are combining these in vitro models with the in vivo work in mice and frogs and in collaboration with human geneticists and anthropologists with the morphometric measurements of craniofacial features in human populations EXPLORING GENOMIC DARK MATTER TRANSPOSABLE ELEMENTSTransposable element TE derived sequences comprise nearly half of the human genome It is not always appreciated however that most TEs that are present in modern humans invaded the ancestral genome at various points of primate evolution but are typically not shared with more distal mammals such as rodents Thus TE derived sequences form a vast reservoir of largely sequences from which novel regulatory functions can evolve We are interested in understanding how TEs may serve as a substrate for evolution of and elements for the host genes and we are investigating a developmental aspect of transposon regulation Courses

Henriques Bhanu Scruggs Nady Still Garcia B Adelman Wysocka J 2017 66 4 Abstract Monomethylation of histone H3 at lysine 4 H3K4me1 and acetylation of histone H3 at lysine 27 H3K27ac are correlated with transcriptionally engaged enhancer elements but the functional impact of these modifications on enhancer activity is not well understood Here we used genome editing to separate catalytic and independent functions of Mll3 Kmt2c and Mll4 Kmt2d Mll2 the major enhancer H3K4 monomethyltransferases Loss of H3K4me1 from enhancers in catalytically deficient cells causes partial reduction of H3K27ac but has surprisingly minor effects on transcription from either enhancers or promoters In contrast loss of proteins leads to strong depletion of enhancer Pol II occupancy and eRNA synthesis concomitant with downregulation of target genes Interestingly downregulated genes exhibit reduced polymerase levels in gene bodies but not at promoters suggestive of defects Altogether our results suggest that enhancer H3K4me1 provides only a minor contribution to the coactivator function of View details for DOI View details for Web of Science ID 000401512200014 View details for PubMedID

as parasitic DNA whose spread in the genome must be controlled by the host but also as major players in genome evolution and Long INterspersed or L1 the only currently autonomous mobile transposon in humans occupies 17 of the genome and continues to generate and genetic variation in some cases resulting in Nonetheless how L1 activity is controlled and what function L1s play in host gene regulation remain incompletely understood Here we use screening strategies in two distinct human cell lines to provide the first survey of genes involved in L1 retrotransposition control We identified functionally diverse genes that either promote or restrict L1 retrotransposition These genes often associated with human diseases control the L1 lifecycle at transcriptional or levels and in a manner that can depend on the endogenous L1 sequence underscoring the complexity of L1 regulation We further investigated L1 restriction by MORC2 and human silencing hub HUSH complex subunits MPP8 and TASOR8 selectively bind evolutionarily young L1s located within transcriptionally permissive euchromatic environment and promote H3K9me3 deposition for transcriptional silencing Interestingly these silencing events often occur within introns of transcriptionally active genes and lead to of host gene expression in a manner Together we provide a rich resource for studies of L1 retrotransposition elucidate a novel L1 restriction pathway and illustrate how epigenetic silencing of TEs rewires host gene expression programs View details for PubMedID 29211708 Landscapes Transcriptional Enhancers in Development

retroviral infections and comprise nearly 8 of the human genome The most recently acquired human ERV is HERVK which repeatedly infected the primate lineage both before and after the divergence of the human and chimpanzee common ancestor Unlike most other human ERVs HERVK retained multiple copies of intact open reading frames encoding retroviral proteins However HERVK is transcriptionally silenced by the host with the exception of in certain pathological contexts such as tumours melanoma or human immunodeficiency virus HIV infection Here we demonstrate that DNA hypomethylation at long terminal repeat elements representing the most recent genomic integrations together with transactivation by OCT4 also known as POU5F1 synergistically facilitate HERVK expression Consequently HERVK is transcribed during normal human embryogenesis beginning with embryonic genome activation at the stage continuing through the emergence of epiblast cells in preimplantation blastocysts and ceasing during human embryonic stem cell derivation from blastocyst outgrowths Remarkably we detected HERVK particles and Gag proteins in human blastocysts indicating that early human development proceeds in the presence of retroviral products We further show that overexpression of one such product the HERVK accessory protein Rec in a pluripotent cell line is sufficient to increase IFITM1 levels on the cell surface and inhibit viral infection suggesting at least one mechanism through which HERVK can induce viral restriction pathways in early embryonic cells Moreover Rec directly binds a subset of cellular RNAs and modulates their ribosome occupancy indicating that complex interactions between retroviral proteins and host factors can pathways of early human development View details for DOI View

Sanosaka Kohyama Hayashi Nakajima Takahashi Wysocka Kosaki Okano 2017 6 Abstract CHARGE syndrome is caused by heterozygous mutations in the chromatin remodeler CHD7 and is characterized by a set of malformations that on clinical grounds were historically postulated to arise from defects in neural crest formation during embryogenesis To better delineate neural crest defects in CHARGE syndrome we generated induced pluripotent stem cells iPSCs from two patients with typical syndrome manifestations and characterized neural crest cells differentiated in vitro from these iPSCs We found that expression of genes associated with cell migration was altered in CHARGE compared to control Consistently CHARGE showed defective delamination migration and motility in vitro and their transplantation in ovo revealed overall defective migratory activity in the chick embryo These results support the historical inference that CHARGE syndrome patients exhibit defects in neural crest migration and provide the first successful application of iPSCs in modeling craniofacial disorders View details for PubMedID 29179815 View details for PubMedCentralID PMC5705211 CSNK1a1 Regulates PRMT1 to Maintain

tissue while suppressing premature differentiation Protein arginine methyltransferases PRMTs affect many processes however their role in progenitor function is incompletely understood PRMT1 was found to be the most highly expressed PRMT in epidermal progenitors and the most downregulated PRMT during differentiation In targeted mouse knockouts and in regenerated human mosaic epidermis in vivo epidermal PRMT1 loss abolished progenitor and led to premature differentiation Mass spectrometry of the PRMT1 protein interactome identified the CSNK1a1 kinase which also proved essential for progenitor maintenance CSNK1a1 directly bound and phosphorylated PRMT1 to control its genomic targeting to proliferation genes as well as differentiation genes Among the latter were GRHL3 whose derepression was required for the premature differentiation seen with PRMT1 and CSNK1a1 loss Maintenance of the progenitors thus requires cooperation by PRMT1 and CSNK1a1 to sustain proliferation gene expression and suppress premature differentiation driven by GRHL3 View details for PubMedID 28943242 E2F activation of S phase promoters via association with and the MLL family of histone H3K4

progression particularly the S phase E2F proteins repress transcription in association with retinoblastoma pocket proteins but less is known about how they activate transcription Here we show that the human G1 phase regulator associates with both activator E2F1 and E2F3a and repressor E2F4 E2F proteins properties that are conserved in insect cells Human interactions are versatile their associations and binding to promoters are selective and displays coactivator properties when bound to the E2F1 activator and corepressor properties when bound to the E2F4 repressor During the phase transition recruits the leukemia MLL and histone H3 lysine 4 methyltransferases to promoters and induces histone methylation and transcriptional activation These results suggest that induces transcriptional

with virtually all processes including gene expression regulation DNA replication mitosis and meiosis and DNA repair In order to better understand the mechanistic basis by which histone modifications participate in the control of cellular processes it is essential to identify and characterize downstream effector proteins or readers that are responsible for recognizing different marks and translating them into specific biological outcomes Ideally identification of potential effectors should occur in an unbiased fashion Although in the recent years much progress has been made in identifying readers of histone modifications in particular methylation recognition of the majority of known histone marks is still poorly understood Here I describe a simple and unbiased biochemical

Li Ilin Wang Duncan Wysocka Allis Patel J 2006 442 7098 Abstract and trimethylated states of particular histone lysine residues are selectively found in different regions of chromatin thereby implying specialized biological functions for these marks ranging from heterochromatin formation to inactivation and transcriptional regulation A major challenge in chromatin biology has centred on efforts to define the connection between specific methylation states and distinct biological impacting on function For example histone H3 trimethylated at lysine 4 H3K4me3 is associated with transcription start sites of active genes but the molecular involved in specific recognition of H3K4me3 tails remain poorly understood Here we demonstrate the molecular basis for specific recognition of H3 K4me3 residues of histone H3 trimethylated at K4 by a plant homeodomain PHD finger of human BPTF bromodomain and PHD domain transcription factor the largest subunit of the complex NURF nucleosome remodelling factor We report on crystallographic and NMR structures of the PHD finger of BPTF in free and H3 states H3 K4me3 interacts through formation on the surface of the PHD finger with the long side chains of arginine 2 R2 and K4me3 fitting snugly in adjacent surface pockets and bracketing an invariant tryptophan The observed stapling role by R2 and K4me3 provides a molecular explanation for H3K4me3 site specificity Binding studies establish that the BPTF PHD finger exhibits a modest preference for over H3 peptides and discriminates against monomethylated and unmodified counterparts Furthermore we identified key residues from binding studies of H3 K4me3 with PHD finger point mutants Our findings call attention to the PHD finger as a previously uncharacterized module found in a large number of

epigenetic indexing system demarcating transcriptionally active and inactive chromatin domains Trimethylation of histone H3 lysine 4 H3K4me3 marks transcription start sites of virtually all active genes Recently we reported that the protein WDR5 is important for global levels of H3K4me3 and control of HOX gene expression Here we show that a plant homeodomain PHD finger of nucleosome remodelling factor NURF an complex mediates a direct preferential association with H3K4me3 tails Depletion of H3K4me3 causes partial release of the NURF subunit BPTF bromodomain and PHD finger transcription factor from chromatin and defective recruitment of the associated ATPase SNF2L also known as ISWI and SMARCA1 to the HOXC8 promoter Loss of BPTF in Xenopus embryos mimics WDR5 phenotypes and compromises spatial control of Hox gene expression These results strongly suggest that WDR5 and NURF function in a common biological pathway in vivo and that chromatin remodelling is directly coupled to H3K4 trimethylation to maintain Hox gene expression patterns during development We also identify a previously unknown function for the PHD finger as a highly specialized domain View details for DOI

Methylation of histones by protein arginine methyltransferases PRMTs is increasingly being found to play an important and dynamic role in gene regulation In mammals and histone asymmetric is involved in gene activation while histone symmetric is associated with gene repression Insight into mechanisms by which histone arginine methylation can be dynamically regulated comes from recent reports demonstrating that conversion of histone methylarginine residues to citrulline by peptidylarginine deiminase 4 PADI4 leads to transcriptional repression While the downstream cellular effects of histone arginine methylation remain poorly understood recent findings indicate that protein arginine methylation in general is required for mammalian development and is also likely important for

interaction sites were mapped to MLL1 and MOF zinc finger domains The purified complex has a robust histone methyltransferase activity that can effect and trimethylation of H3 K4 and a histone

residues in histones has been correlated with epigenetic forms of gene regulation Although histone methyltransferases are known enzymes that demethylate histones have not been identified Here we

including those sites methylated by coactivators CARM1 H3 Arg17 and PRMT1 H4 Arg3 A decrease of histone Arg methylation with a concomitant increase of citrullination requires PAD4 activity in human

show here that separate regions of critical for its role in cell proliferation associate with the Sin3 histone deacetylase HDAC and a previously uncharacterized human histone methyltransferase HMT The HMT methylates histone H3 at Lys 4 K4 but not if the neighboring K9 residue is already methylated tethers the Sin3 and transcriptional regulatory complexes together even though they are generally associated with opposite transcriptional outcomes repression and activation of transcription respectively Nevertheless this tethering is because the transcriptional activator VP16 selectively binds

hamster cell line arrests proliferation at nonpermissive temperatures primarily in a G 0 1 state and displays cytokinesis defects The mutation in tsBN67 cells also causes a dissociation of from chromatin prior to cell proliferation arrest suggesting that association is important for proliferation Here we report that the simian virus 40 SV40 early region in particular large T antigen Tag and the adenovirus oncoprotein E1A can rescue the tsBN67 cell proliferation defect at nonpermissive temperatures The SV40 early region rescues the tsBN67 cell proliferation defect without restoring the association indicating that these oncoproteins bypass a requirement for function The SV40 early region also rescues the tsBN67 cytokinesis defect suggesting that the roles of in cell proliferation and proper cytokinesis are intimately linked The ability of SV40 Tag and adenovirus E1A to inactivate members of the pRb protein p107 and important for the bypass of function These results suggest that

protein VP16 A single substitution in the VP16 interaction domain causes a arrest of cell proliferation in hamster tsBN67 cells and prevents transcriptional activation by VP16 We show here that is naturally bound to chromatin in uninfected cells through its VP16 interaction domain is chromatin bound in tsBN67 cells at permissive temperature but dissociates from chromatin before tsBN67 cells stop proliferating at the nonpermissive temperature suggesting that loss of chromatin association is the primary cause of the tsBN67 cell proliferation arrest We propose that the role of in cell

Caenorhabditis elegans that can associate with and activate VP16 Here we demonstrate developmental regulation of elegans HCF CeHCF phosphorylation a hyperphosphorylated form of CeHCF is present in embryos whereas a hypophosphorylated form is present in L1 larvae The phosphorylation patterns of endogenous CeHCF in worms and ectopically synthesized CeHCF in mammalian cells are remarkably similar suggesting that the way CeHCF can be recognized by kinases is conserved in animals mapping of endogenous CeHCF however revealed that phosphorylation occurs at four clustered sites in the region of the protein that is not highly conserved among HCF proteins and is not required for complex formation Indeed phosphorylation of either CeHCF or human appears to be dispensable for association with VP16 All four CeHCF phosphorylation sites match the consensus recognition site for the kinases CDC2 and CDK2 Consistent with this similarity and with the developmental phosphorylation of CeHCF in elegans embryos CeHCF phosphorylation is in mammalian cells View details for Web of Science ID 000168635900023 View details for PubMedID 11341844 Report Accessibility Issues Powered By CAP Network Stanford
