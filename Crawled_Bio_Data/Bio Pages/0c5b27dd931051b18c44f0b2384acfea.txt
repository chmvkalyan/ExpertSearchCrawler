overall patient health are essential to inform treatment decisions for patients diagnosed with cancer The authors applied XWAS methods herein referred to as association study LWAS to evaluate associations between routinely collected laboratory tests and survival in veterans with prostate The authors identified patients who were diagnosed with prostate cancer between 2000 and 2013 in the Veterans Health Administration using any laboratory tests collected within 6 months of diagnosis results Using the LWAS framework the rate was used to test the association between multiple laboratory tests and survival and these results were validated using training testing and validation A total of 31 laboratory tests associated with survival met stringent LWAS criteria LWAS confirmed markers of prostate cancer biology antigen hazard ratio HR 95 confidence interval 95 CI and alkaline phosphatase HR 95 CI as well laboratory tests of general health eg serum albumin HR 95 CI and creatinine HR 95 CI and inflammation leukocyte count HR 95 CI and erythrocyte sedimentation rate HR 95 CI In addition the authors derived and validated separate models for patients with localized and advanced disease identifying 28 laboratory markers and 15 laboratory markers respectively in each The authors identified routinely collected laboratory data associated with survival for patients with prostate cancer using LWAS methodologies including markers of prostate cancer biology overall health and inflammation Broadening consideration of determinants of survival beyond those related to cancer itself could help to inform the design of clinical trials and aid in shared decision SUMMARY This article examined routine laboratory tests associated with survival among veterans with prostate cancer Using association studies the authors identified 31 laboratory tests associated with survival that can be used to inform the design of clinical trials and aid patients in shared decision making View details

Wong Wu Horschman Zhao Brooks 2020 Abstract Renal injury leads to chronic kidney disease for which women are not only more likely to be diagnosed with than men but have poorer outcomes as well We have previously shown that expression of Sprr2f a member of the Small Proline Rich Region Sprr gene family is increased several after renal injury using a unilateral ureteral obstruction UUO mouse model To better understand the role of Sprr2f in renal injury we generated a Sprr2f knockout mouse model using technology female mice showed greater renal damage after UUO compared to wild type animals evidenced by higher hydroxyproline levels and denser collagen staining indicating a protective role of Sprr2f during renal injury Gene expression profiling by identified 162 genes whose expression levels were significantly different between day 0 and day 5 after UUO in mice Out of the 162 genes 121 were upregulated after UUO and enriched with those involved in a phenomenon not observed in wild type animals suggesting a protective role of Sprr2f in UUO through defense against oxidative damage Consistently bilateral ischemia reperfusion injury resulted in higher serum blood urea nitrogen level and higher tissue reactive oxygen species ROS in compared to female mice Moreover cultured renal epithelial cells from female mice showed lower viability after oxidative damage induced by menadione compared to cells that could be rescued by supplementation with reduced glutathione suggesting that Sprr2f induction after renal damage acts as a defense against ROS View details for DOI

Cowan Brooks Dash Gleave Martin Morgan Nelson Thompson Wagner A Carroll Lin 2020 e203187 Abstract Importance Active surveillance is increasingly recognized as the preferred standard of care for men with prostate cancer However active surveillance requires repeated assessments including antigen tests and biopsies that may increase anxiety risk of complications and To identify and validate clinical parameters that can identify men who can safely defer prostate cancer Setting and Participants The Canary Prostate Active Surveillance Study PASS is a multicenter prospective active surveillance cohort study initiated in July 2008 with ongoing accrual and a median period of years Men with prostate cancer managed with active surveillance from 9 North American academic medical centers were enrolled Blood tests and biopsies were conducted on a defined schedule for least 5 years after enrollment Model validation was performed among men at the University of California San Francisco UCSF who did not enroll in PASS Men with Gleason grade group 1 prostate cancer diagnosed since 2003 and enrolled in PASS before 2017 with at least 1 confirmatory biopsy after diagnosis were included A total of 850 men met these criteria and had adequate For the UCSF validation study 533 active surveillance patients meeting the same criteria were identified Exclusion criteria were treatment within 6 months of diagnosis diagnosis before 2003 Gleason grade score of at least 2 at diagnosis or first surveillance biopsy no surveillance biopsy or missing Active surveillance for prostate Outcomes and Measures Time from confirmatory biopsy to reclassification defined as Gleason grade group 2 or higher on subsequent A total of 850 men median interquartile range age 64 years 774 91 White were included in the PASS cohort A total of 533 men median interquartile range age 61 years 422 79 White were included in the UCSF cohort Parameters predictive of reclassification on multivariable analysis included maximum percent positive cores hazard ratio HR 95 CI history of any negative biopsy after diagnosis 1 vs 0 HR 95 CI P and vs 0 HR 95 CI P time since diagnosis HR 95 CI P body mass index HR 95 CI P prostate size HR 95 CI P antigen at diagnosis HR 95 CI and antigen kinetics HR 95 CI P For prediction of nonreclassification at 4 years the area under the receiver operating curve was for the PASS cohort and for the UCSF validation cohort This model achieved a negative predictive value of 95 CI for those in the bottom 25th percentile of risk and of 95 CI for those in the bottom 10th and Relevance In this study among men with prostate cancer heterogeneity prevailed in risk of subsequent disease reclassification These findings suggest that active surveillance intensity can be modulated based on an individual risk parameters and that many men may be safely monitored with a substantially less intensive surveillance regimen View details for DOI

Berg Toft Brooks Brasso Roder A 2020 10 8 Abstract Biomarkers for predicting the risk of prostate cancer CRPC in men treated with primary androgen deprivation therapy ADT are lacking We investigated whether 2 glycoprotein AZGP1 expression in the diagnostic biopsies of men with prostate cancer PCa undergoing primary ADT was predictive of the development of CRPC and mortality The study included 191 patients who commenced ADT from 2000 to 2011 The AZGP1 expression was evaluated using immunohistochemistry and scored as high or low expression The risks of CRPC and mortality were analyzed using stratified cumulative incidences and a COX regression analysis for competing risk assessment The median time was IQR years In total 94 and 97 patients presented with low and high AZGP1 expression respectively A low AZGP1 expression was found to be associated with a shorter time to CRPC when compared to patients with a high AZGP1 expression HR 95 CI p However the multivariable analysis demonstrated no added benefit by adding the AZGP1 expression to prediction models for CRPC No differences for mortality between the AZGP1 groups were observed In conclusion a low AZGP1 expression was associated with a shorter time to CRPC for PCa patients treated with ADT but did not add any predictive information besides clinicopathological variables View details for DOI View details for PubMedID

However few models are specific to the population served or easily implemented in a clinical setting We sought to create life expectancy estimates specific to Veterans diagnosed with prostate AND METHODS Using national Veterans Health Administration electronic health records we identified Veterans diagnosed with prostate cancer between 2000 and 2015 We abstracted demographics comorbidities oncologic staging and treatment information We fit Cox Proportional Hazards models to determine the impact of age comorbidity cancer risk and race on survival We stratified life expectancy estimates by age comorbidity and cancer Our analytic cohort included patients Survival modeling demonstrated the importance of age and comorbidity across all cancer risk categories Life expectancy estimates generated from age and comorbidity data were predictive of overall survival 95 CI and visualized using plots and heatmaps stratified by age and comorbidity Separate life expectancy estimates were generated for patients with localized or advanced disease These life expectancy estimates calibrate well across prostate cancer risk Life expectancy estimates are essential to providing prostate cancer care We developed accessible life expectancy estimation tools for Veterans diagnosed with prostate cancer that can be used in routine clinical practice to inform making View details for DOI

Ghanouni Brooks Sonn A 2020 Abstract PURPOSE Magnetic resonance imaging MRI has great potential to improve prostate cancer diagnosis however subtle differences between cancer and confounding conditions render prostate MRI interpretation challenging The tissue collected from patients who undergo radical prostatectomy provides a unique opportunity to correlate histopathology images of the prostate with MRI to accurately map the extent of cancer from histopathology images onto MRI We seek to develop an platform to align MRI and histopathology images of resected prostates in patients who underwent radical prostatectomy to create accurate cancer labels on Here we introduce RAdiology Pathology Spatial Integration RAPSODI the first framework for the registration of radiology and pathology images RAPSODI relies on three steps First it creates a 3D reconstruction of the histopathology specimen as a digital representation of the tissue before gross sectioning Second RAPSODI registers corresponding histopathology and MRI slices Third the optimized transforms are applied to the cancer regions outlined on the histopathology images to project those labels onto the We tested RAPSODI in a phantom study where we simulated various conditions tissue shrinkage during fixation Our experiments showed that RAPSODI can reliably correct multiple artifacts We also evaluated RAPSODI in 157 patients from three institutions that underwent radical prostatectomy and have very different pathology processing and scanning RAPSODI was evaluated in 907 corresponding slices and achieved a Dice coefficient of for the prostate a Hausdorff distance of mm for the prostate boundary a urethra deviation of mm and a landmark deviation of mm between registered histopathology images and Our robust framework successfully mapped the extent of cancer from histopathology slices onto MRI providing labels from training machine learning methods to detect cancer on MRI View details for DOI View

increases in TGCT in recent decades It is unknown whether increases in incidence differ according to neighborhood sociodemographic We conducted a study of Hispanic and NH White men total diagnosed with TGCT in California during the three most recent pericensal periods We calculated incidence rates according to neighborhood socioeconomic status nSES and among Hispanics according to ethnic enclave We calculated incidence rate ratios to compare rates across nSES and ethnic enclave and to examine changes in rates over pericensal time periods according to these neighborhood factors for major histologic types seminoma and nonseminoma Hispanic men residing in high SES compared to low SES neighborhoods had greater incidence of seminoma and nonseminoma testicular cancer across pericensal periods as did Hispanic men in low enclave less ethnic compared to high enclave neighborhoods Between the periods and Hispanic men residing in low SES neighborhoods experienced a 39 increased incidence of seminoma while those residing in low and middle SES neighborhoods experienced 87 and 48 increased incidence of nonseminoma While TGCT incidence has increased among all Hispanic men incidence increases appear to be driven disproportionately by those residing in lower SES and lower enclave neighborhoods particularly for nonseminoma View details for DOI View details for

between cells within the dynamic tumor ecosystem Transformative genomics technologies and spatial multiplex in situ methods now provide an opportunity to interrogate this complexity at unprecedented resolution The Human Tumor Atlas Network HTAN part of the National Cancer Institute NCI Cancer Moonshot Initiative will establish a clinical experimental computational and organizational framework to generate informative and accessible atlases of cancer transitions for a diverse set of tumor types This effort complements both ongoing efforts to map healthy organs and previous cancer genomics approaches focused on bulk sequencing at a single point in time Generating multiparametric longitudinal atlases and integrating them with clinical outcomes should help identify novel predictive biomarkers and features as well as therapeutically relevant cell types cell states and cellular interactions across transitions The resulting tumor atlases should have a profound impact on our

Efficient capture of routine clinical care and patient outcomes are needed at a as is evidence on important side effects and their effect on and clinical outcomes The increasing availability of electronic health records EHRs offers new opportunities to generate evidence on oncological care that can better guide treatment decisions and This study includes patients seeking care at an academic medical center Digital data sources are combined to address missingness inaccuracy and noise common to EHR data Clinical concepts were identified and extracted from EHR unstructured data using natural language processing NLP and learning techniques All models are trained tested and validated on independent data samples using standard We provide use cases for using EHR data to assess guideline adherence and quality measurements among cancer patients Pretreatment assessment was evaluated by guideline adherence and quality metrics for cancer staging metrics Patient outcomes included and Advanced technologies applied to EHRs present opportunities to advance quality assessment to learn from routinely collected clinical data for personalized treatment and to augment epidemiological and population health studies The effective use of digital data can inform care quality initiatives and policy A comprehensive set of health data analyzed with advanced technologies results in a unique

of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America Xiao Thakkar Zhao Broughton Li Seoane J Diep Metzner von Eyben Dill Brooks Curtis Leppert Ye Peehl Giaccia Sinha Rankin B 2020 Abstract Loss of the von VHL tumor suppressor is a hallmark feature of renal clear cell carcinoma VHL inactivation results in the constitutive activation of the factors HIFs and and their downstream targets including the proangiogenic factors VEGF and PDGF However antiangiogenic agents and inhibitors have limited efficacy in cancer therapy due to the development of resistance Here we employed an innovative computational platform Mining of Synthetic Lethals MiSL to identify synthetic lethal interactions with the loss of VHL through analysis of primary tumor genomic and transcriptomic data Using this approach we identified a synthetic lethal interaction between VHL and the m6A RNA demethylase FTO in renal cell carcinoma MiSL identified FTO as a synthetic lethal partner of VHL because deletions of FTO are mutually exclusive with VHL loss in pan cancer datasets Moreover FTO expression is increased in ccRCC tumors compared to normal adjacent tissue Genetic inactivation of FTO using multiple orthogonal approaches revealed that FTO inhibition selectively reduces the growth and survival of cells in vitro and in vivo Notably FTO inhibition reduced the survival of both HIF wild type and tumors identifying FTO as an vulnerability of cancers Integrated analysis of and analysis identified the glutamine transporter SLC1A5 as an FTO target that promotes metabolic reprogramming and survival of ccRCC cells These findings identify FTO as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of renal cell carcinoma View details for DOI View details for PubMedID 32817424

academic medical center Using a hybrid NLP pipeline that combines and deep learning methodologies we classified positive UI cases as mild moderate and severe by mining clinical model accurately classified UI into disease severity categories accuracy which outperformed the deep learning model accuracy In the deep learning model the recall rates for mild and moderate group were higher than the precision rate and respectively A hybrid model that combined both methods did not improve the accuracy of the model but did outperform the deep learning model accuracy patients based on indication and severity of PCOs is essential to advance a patient centered LHS EHRs contain valuable information on PCOs and by using NLP methods it is feasible to accurately and efficiently phenotype PCO severity

Renal Cell Carcinoma JCO precision oncology Brennan Metzner Kao Massie Stewart Haile Brooks Hitchins Leppert Gevaert O 2020 4 Abstract A challenge in the diagnosis of renal cell carcinoma RCC is to distinguish chromophobe RCC chRCC from benign renal oncocytoma because these tumor types are histologically and morphologically similar yet they require different clinical management Molecular biomarkers could provide a way of distinguishing oncocytoma from chRCC which could prevent unnecessary treatment of oncocytoma Such biomarkers could also be applied to preoperative biopsy specimens such as needle core biopsy specimens to avoid unnecessary surgery of profiled DNA methylation in oncocytoma and chRCC tumors and adjacent normal tissue and used machine learning to identify a signature of differentially methylated sites CpGs that robustly distinguish oncocytoma from clustering of Stanford and preexisting RCC data from The Cancer Genome Atlas TCGA revealed that of all RCC subtypes oncocytoma is most similar to chRCC Unexpectedly however oncocytoma features more extensive overall abnormal methylation than does chRCC We identified 79 CpGs with large methylation differences between oncocytoma and chRCC A diagnostic model trained on 30 CpGs could distinguish oncocytoma from chRCC in area under the receiver operating curve AUC 95 CI to and could distinguish TCGA chRCCs from an independent set of oncocytomas from a previous study AUC This signature also separated oncocytoma from other RCC subtypes and normal tissue revealing it as a standalone diagnostic biomarker for CpG signature could be developed as a clinical biomarker to support differential diagnosis of oncocytoma and chRCC in surgical samples With improved biopsy techniques this signature

cancer therapy due to the development of resistance In clear cell renal cell carcinoma ccRCC AXL expression is associated with antiangiogenic resistance and poor survival Here we establish a role for signaling in promoting the angiogenic potential of ccRCC cells through the regulation of the plasminogen receptor S100A10 Genetic and therapeutic inhibition of AXL signaling in ccRCC tumor xenografts reduced tumor vessel density and growth under the renal capsule signaling activated the expression of S100A10 through SRC to promote plasmin production endothelial cell invasion and angiogenesis

types including Identify prognostic miRNAs and determine the role of in Hierarchical clustering was done in R using gene expression profiles of over 450 ccRCC cases in The Cancer Genome Atlas TCGA analysis was performed to identify prognostic miRNAs in the TCGA dataset was performed to identify target genes in primary ccRCC cells and Matrigel invasion assay was performed to assess the effects of overexpression on cell Hierarchical clustering analysis using prognostic genes previously identified by our group demonstrated that ccRCC patients with longer overall survival expressed lower levels of genes promoting proliferation or immune responses while better maintaining gene expression associated with cortical differentiation and cell adhesion Targets of 26 miRNAs were significantly enriched in the prognostic genes and these miRNAs were prognostic by themselves was associated with poor overall survival in the TCGA dataset Overexpression of promoted invasion of primary ccRCC cells

than BPH pathophysiology and are only partially effective Here we applied sequencing to gain new insight into BPH By RNAseq we uncovered transcriptional heterogeneity among BPH cases where a BPH stromal signature correlated with symptom severity Stromal signaling molecules BMP5 and CXCL13 were enriched in BPH while estrogen regulated pathways were depleted Notably BMP5 addition to cultured prostatic myofibroblasts altered their expression profile towards a BPH profile that included the BPH stromal signature RNAseq also suggested an altered cellular milieu in BPH which we verified by immunohistochemistry and RNAseq In particular BPH tissues exhibited enrichment of myofibroblast subsets whilst depletion of neuroendocrine cells and an estrogen receptor ESR1 fibroblast cell type residing near epithelium By sequencing we uncovered somatic variants SNVs in BPH of uncertain pathogenic significance but indicative of clonal cell expansions Thus genomic characterization of BPH has identified a stromal signature and new candidate disease pathways including a likely role for BMP5 signaling and reveals BPH to be not merely a hyperplasia but rather a fundamental of cell types View

mpMRI is abnormal 1 This approach reduced of cancer while increasing detection of clinically significant cancer CSC Still important questions remain regarding the reproducibility of these findings outside of a clinical trial and quantifying missed CSC diagnoses using this approach To address these issues we retrospectively applied the PRECISION strategy in men who each underwent prebiopsy mpMRI followed by systematic and targeted imaging and pathology data were prospectively collected from 358 biopsy naïve men and 202 men with previous negative biopsies To apply the PRECISION approach a retrospective analysis was done comparing the cancer yield from 2 diagnostic strategies 1 mpMRI followed by targeted biopsy alone for men with Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System 3 lesions and 2 systematic biopsy alone for all men Primary outcomes were biopsies avoided and the proportion of CSC cancer Grade Group and Grade Group 1 biopsy naïve patients the mpMRI diagnostic strategy would have avoided 19 of biopsies while detecting more CSC and 12 less P Thirteen percent 9 of men with normal mpMRI had CSC on systematic biopsy For previous negative biopsy patients the mpMRI diagnostic strategy avoided 21 of biopsies while detecting more CSC and 13 less P Seven percent 3 of men with normal mpMRI had CSC on systematic results provide external validation of the PRECISION finding that mpMRI followed by targeted biopsy of suspicious lesions reduces biopsies and of cancer Unlike PRECISION we did not find increased diagnosis of CSC This was true in both biopsy naïve and previously negative biopsy cohorts We have incorporated this information into shared decision making which has led some men to choose to avoid biopsy However we continue to recommend targeted and systematic

oncology Hoerner Massoudi Metzner Stell Kong Liliental Brooks Sabatti Leppert Fan 2018 Abstract To personalize treatment for renal cell carcinoma RCC it would be ideal to confirm the activity of druggable protein pathways within individual tumors We have developed a nanoimmunoassay NIA to measure protein activity with high precision in scant specimens eg fine needle aspirates FNAs Here we used NIA to determine whether protein activation varied in different regions of RCC tumors Since most RCC therapies target angiogenesis by inhibiting the vascular endothelial growth factor VEGF receptor we quantified phosphorylation of extracellular kinase ERK a downstream effector of the VEGF signaling pathway In 90 ex vivo FNA biopsies sampled from multiple regions of 38 primary clear cell RCC tumors ERK phosphorylation differed among patients In contrast within individual patients we found limited intratumoral heterogeneity of ERK phosphorylation Our results suggest that measuring ERK in a single FNA may be representative of ERK activity in different regions of the same tumor As diagnostic and therapeutic protein biomarkers are being sought NIA measurements of protein signaling may increase the clinical utility of renal mass biopsy and allow for the application of precision oncology for patients with localized and advanced RCC PATIENT SUMMARY In this report we applied a new approach to measure the activity of extracellular kinase ERK a key cancer signaling protein in different areas within kidney cancers We found that ERK activity varied between patients but that different regions within individual kidney tumors showed similar ERK activity This suggests that a single biopsy of renal cell carcinoma may be sufficient to measure protein signaling activity to aid

Comprehensive Cancer Network JNCCN Lichtensztajn Leppert Brooks Shah Sieh Chung Gomez Cheng I 2018 16 11 Abstract Background The NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology recommend definitive therapy for all men with localized prostate cancer PCa who have a life expectancy 5 years or who are symptomatic However the application of these guidelines may vary among ethnic groups We compared receipt of treatment between Latino and white men in California Methods California Cancer Registry data were used to identify Latino and white men diagnosed with localized PCa from 2010 through 2014 The association of clinical and sociodemographic factors with definitive treatment was examined using logistic regression overall and by ethnicity Results Latinos were less likely than whites to receive definitive treatment before odds ratio OR 95 CI and after adjusting for age and tumor characteristics OR 95 CI Additional adjustment for sociodemographic factors eliminated the disparity However the association with treatment differed by ethnicity for several factors Latino men with no health insurance were considerably less likely to receive definitive treatment relative to insured Latino men OR 95 CI an association that was more pronounced than among whites OR 95 CI disease was associated with lower odds of definitive treatment in Latinos OR 95 CI but not whites Younger age and care at Cancer Centers were significantly associated with receipt of definitive treatment in whites but not in Latinos Conclusions California Latino men diagnosed with localized PCa are at increased risk for undertreatment The observed treatment disparity is largely explained by sociodemographic factors suggesting it may be ameliorated through targeted outreach such as that aimed at younger and underinsured Latino men View details for PubMedID 30442735 Elevated urinary and monocyte chemoattractant levels in children with congenital ureteropelvic junction obstruction Journal of pediatric

damage or kidneys at risk for damage Urinary levels of IL6 neutrophil lipocalin LCN2 monocyte chemoattractant MCP1 and transforming growth TGFB1 proteins have been correlated with renal damage in several contexts Whether they might be useful biomarkers of obstructive nephropathy due to unilateral and bilateral congenital UPJO was AND METHODS A cohort study was performed at People Hospital of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region in China Bladder urine samples from 17 patients with UPJO were obtained before surgical intervention and from 17 healthy controls Levels of IL6 LCN2 MCP1 and TGFB1 were determined by immunosorbent assay and normalized to urinary creatinine Levels of urinary LCN2 MCP1 and IL6 were significantly elevated in the urine from individuals with UPJO compared with controls and respectively Children with bilateral UPJO showed significantly higher levels of IL6 LCN2 and MCP1 protein in their urine compared with controls or those with unilateral UPJO P and respectively Combining LCN2 and MCP1 slightly improved biomarker Urinary biomarkers could be used in obstructed patients to monitor for renal damage and might find particular utility on patients with bilateral UPJO Monitoring urinary biomarkers and imaging features in untreated patients could provide insights into the natural history of renal damage due to obstruction and will be necessary to test their performance characteristics as Urinary levels of LCN2 and MCP1 protein are promising biomarkers monitoring children with UPJO particularly in those with bilateral disease View details for

within 5 yr Median was After adjusting for prostate size time since diagnosis biopsy parameters and diagnostic PSA PSAk was a significant predictor of reclassification hazard ratio for each increase in 95 confidence interval p The PSAk model improved stratification of risk prediction for the top and bottom deciles of risk over a model without PSAk Model performance was essentially identical using PSA data measured every 6 mo to those measured every 3 mo The major limitation is the reliability of reclassification as an end point although it drives most treatment calculated using an LMEM statistically significantly predicts biopsy reclassification Models that use repeat PSA measurements outperform a model incorporating only diagnostic PSA Model performance is similar using PSA assessed every 3 or 6 mo If validated these results should inform optimal incorporation of PSA trends into active surveillance protocols and risk this report we looked at whether repeat antigen PSA measurements or PSA kinetics improve prediction of biopsy outcomes in men using active surveillance to manage localized prostate cancer We found that in a large multicenter active surveillance cohort

DIAGNOSIS THERAPY Lasseigne Brooks 2018 22 4 Abstract Renal cell carcinoma RCC is the most common kidney cancer and includes several molecular and histological subtypes with different clinical characteristics While survival rates are high if RCC is diagnosed when still confined to the kidney and treated definitively there are no specific diagnostic screening tests available and symptoms are rare in early stages of the disease Management of advanced RCC has changed significantly with the advent of targeted therapies yet survival is usually increased by months due to acquired resistance to these therapies DNA methylation the covalent addition of a methyl group to a cytosine is essential for normal development and transcriptional regulation but becomes altered commonly in cancer These alterations result in broad transcriptional changes including in tumor suppressor genes Because DNA methylation is one of the earliest molecular changes in cancer and is both widespread and stable its role in cancer biology including RCC has been extensively studied In this review we examine the role of DNA methylation in RCC disease etiology and progression the preclinical use of DNA methylation

de novo metastatic PCa The incidence of de novo metastatic PCa decreased from to per men in the SEER cohort whereas it increased from to per men in the DaPCaR cohort PCa mortality in the SEER cohort was stable for men diagnosed with de novo metastatic PCa from 1980 to 1994 and increased slightly in the latest periods studied P whereas it decreased by P in the DaPCaR earlier detection de novo metastatic PCa remains associated with a high risk of mortality The reduced PCa mortality in the Danish cohort is largely explained by Early detection strategies do indeed decrease the incidence of de

who are on active surveillance AS for prostate cancer will have surveillance prostate needle biopsies PNBs without any cancer define the association between negative surveillance PNBs and risk of reclassification on men were enrolled in the Canary Prostate Active Surveillance Study PASS between 2008 and 2016 Men were included if they had Gleason prostate cancer and 34 core involvement ratio at diagnosis Men were prescribed surveillance PNBs at 12 and 24 mo after diagnosis and then every 24 was defined as an increase in Gleason grade an increase in the ratio of biopsy cores to cancer to PNB outcomes were defined as follows 1 no cancer on biopsy 2 cancer without reclassification or 3 reclassification and Cox proportional hazard models were performed to assess the risk of total of 657 men met inclusion criteria On first surveillance PNB 214 32 had no cancer 282 43 had cancer but no reclassification and 161 25 reclassified Among those who did not reclassify 313 had a second PNB On second PNB 120 38 had no cancer 139 44 had cancer but no reclassification and 54 17 reclassified In a multivariable analysis significant predictors of decreased future reclassification after the first PNB were no cancer on PNB hazard ratio HR lower serum antigen larger prostate size and lower body mass index A finding of no cancer on the second PNB was also associated with significantly decreased future reclassification in a multivariable analysis regardless of the first PNB result The major limitation of this study is a relatively small number of patients with who have a surveillance PNB with no evidence of cancer are significantly less likely to reclassify on AS in the PASS cohort These findings have implications for tailoring AS on active surveillance for prostate cancer who have a biopsy showing no cancer are at a decreased risk of having worse disease in the future This may have an impact on how frequently biopsies are required to be performed in the future View details for

Abstract BACKGROUND It can be challenging to predict the risk of biochemical recurrence BR during after radical prostatectomy RP in men who have undetectable antigen PSA even years after To establish and validate a contemporary nomogram that predicts the absolute risk of BR every year after RP in men with undetectable PSA while accounting for competing risks of SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS A total of 3746 patients from Rigshospitalet Copenhagen Denmark and Stanford Urology Stanford CA USA who underwent RP between 1995 and 2013 were MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS Time to BR was defined as the first PSA result BR risk was computed using multiple Cox regression including preoperative PSA pT category RP Gleason score GS and surgical margin R status Death without BR was considered a competing event The nomogram presents the future risk of BR for a man who is alive and without BR at the time of Validation assessed the discrimination and accuracy using area under the curve and Brier AND LIMITATIONS The nomogram predicts risk of BR up to 12 yr after RP at an individual level As example the risk of BR for a man with pT3a GS 3 4 and preoperative PSA followed for 5 yr with undetectable PSA is 18 for the next 5 yr External validation demonstrated both high accuracy and discrimination The CPC Risk Calculator is available as a free Android and iOS App Declining discrimination and accuracy after 7 yr of is the main This nomogram can be used as a tool to inform men with undetectable PSA during after RP about their future risk of BR and may aid in decisions on the necessity for further The nomogram is the first to be available as a free SUMMARY We developed an easily interpretable nomogram to evaluate the risk of antigen elevation cancer recurrence following complete removal of the prostate radical prostatectomy The tool can aid both physicians and patients in evaluating the future risk of cancer recurrence during after surgery The model is

of renal failure in adults and children and is suspected when hydronephrosis is detected on imaging Since not all cases of hydronephrosis are associated with renal damage biomarkers are needed to guide intervention to relieve obstruction We performed gene expression profiling on the kidneys from adult mice over a detailed time course after obstruction and compared these data to a neonatal model of bilateral high grade obstruction induced by conditional deletion of the calcineurin SS1 Cnb1 gene Having identified a set of 143 transcripts modulated in both adult and neonatal obstruction we tested their expression in a model of obstruction 1 day where renal damage is transient and reversible and obstruction 5 days where significant renal damage is permanent A significantly number of transcripts increased early after obstruction and later normalized while 26 transcripts remained elevated 10 and 28 days after relief of 5 days of ureteral obstruction Using QPCR elevated levels of several of these candidate RNA biomarkers of renal damage were detected in urine from obstructed mice In addition several of these candidate RNA biomarkers of damage due to obstruction were detectable in catheterized urine samples from children undergoing surgery for ureteropelvic junction obstruction UPJO Measurement of urinary transcripts modulated in response to renal obstruction could serve as biomarkers of renal damage with important clinical applications View details for PubMedID 29488389 Male infertility is associated with altered treatment course of men with cancer Andrology Eminaga Li Baker Brooks Eisenberg 2018 Abstract This study aims to evaluate whether cancer treatments differ in infertile men compared to men who have undergone vasectomy and controls We analyzed subjects from the Truven Health MarketScan Claims database from 2001 to 2009 Infertile men were identified through diagnosis and treatment codes Comparison groups included vasectomized men and an cohort who were not infertile and had not undergone vasectomy We considered cancer types previously associated with infertility that were diagnosed after the diagnosis of infertility The treatment regimens were determined based on the presence of claims with CPT codes for chemotherapy CTX radiation RTX or surgical treatment ST for each entity in all study groups Cases with multimodal treatments were also identified As a result CTX was similarly distributed among the infertile vasectomized and control groups In contrast RTX treatment length was shorter in infertile men The frequency of multimodal treatment radiation and chemotherapy was twofold lower in men with infertility compared to other men By focusing on treatment patterns for each cancer type among these groups the duration of RTX and CTX was shorter in infertile men diagnosed with NHL compared to controls We conclude that Infertile men diagnosed with cancer and specific cancer types experience different treatment courses with shorter RTX and less combined compared to fertile and vasectomized men These differences could reflect differences in stage at presentation biological behavior or treatment responses in infertile men

Scientific reports Totten Adusumilli Kullolli Tanimoto Brooks Mallick Pitteri J 2018 8 1 6509 Abstract Currently antigen is used for prostate cancer PCa screening however it lacks the necessary specificity for differentiating PCa from other diseases of the prostate such as benign prostatic hyperplasia BPH presenting a clinical need to distinguish these cases at the molecular level Protein glycosylation plays an important role in a number of cellular processes involved in neoplastic progression and is aberrant in PCa In this study we systematically interrogate the alterations in the

and chromatographically separate and protein glycoforms for analysis as differential expression of these glycan types have been previously associated with PCa Global levels of CD5L CFP C8A BST1 and C7 were significantly increased in the PCa samples Notable alterations between BPH and PCa were identified among proteins CD163 C4A and ATRN in the fraction and among C4BPB and AZGP1 glycoforms in the

introduction of serum Prostate Specific Antigen PSA testing nearly 30 years ago has been associated with a significant shift towards localized disease and decreased deaths due to prostate cancer Recognition that PSA testing has caused over diagnosis and over treatment of prostate cancer has generated considerable controversy over its value and has spurred efforts to identify prognostic biomarkers to distinguish patients who need treatment from those that can be observed Recent studies show that cancer is heterogeneous and forms a hierarchy of tumor cell populations We developed a method of identifying prostate cancer differentiation states related to androgen signaling using Boolean logic Using gene expression data we identified two markers CD38 and ARG2 that group prostate cancer into three differentiation states Cancers with expression patterns corresponding to an undifferentiated state had significantly lower survival compared to the most differentiated group We carried out immunohistochemical IHC staining for these two markers in a single institution Stanford n 234 and Canary n 1326 cohorts IHC staining for CD38 and ARG2 in the Stanford cohort demonstrated that combined expression of CD38 and ARG2 was prognostic In the Canary cohort low CD38 protein expression by IHC was significantly associated with survival RFS seminal vesicle invasion SVI extension

mpMRI physicians should accurately quote patients a numerical risk of cancer based on their MRI The Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System PIRADS standardizes interpretation of mpMRI however reported rates of clinically significant prostate cancer CSC stratified by PIRADS score vary widely While some publications use radical prostatectomy RP specimens as gold standard others use biopsy We hypothesized that much of the variation in CSC stems from differences in cancer prevalence in RP cohorts 100 prevalence vs biopsy cohorts To quantify the impact of this selection bias on cancer yield according to PIRADS score we analyzed data from 614 men with 854 lesions who underwent targeted biopsy from 2014 to 2018 Of these 125 men underwent RP We compared the PIRADS detection rates of CSC Gleason on targeted biopsy between the and RP cohorts For all PIRADS scores CSC yield was much greater in patients who underwent RP For example CSC was found in 30 of PIRADS 3 lesions in men who underwent RP vs in men who underwent biopsy Our results show that mpMRI performance appears to be better in men who undergo RP compared with those who only receive biopsy Physicians should understand the effect of this selection bias and its magnitude when discussing mpMRI results with patients considering biopsy and take great caution in quoting CSC yields from publications using RP as gold

Kunder Nolley Fan Brooks Sonn A 2017 114 13 Abstract Accurate identification of prostate cancer in frozen sections at the time of surgery can be challenging limiting the surgeon ability to best determine resection margins during prostatectomy We performed desorption electrospray ionization mass spectrometry imaging on 54 banked human cancerous and normal prostate tissue specimens to investigate the spatial distribution of a wide variety of small metabolites carbohydrates and lipids In contrast to several previous studies our method included Krebs cycle intermediates 200 which we found to be highly informative in distinguishing cancer from benign tissue Malignant prostate cells showed marked metabolic derangements compared with their benign counterparts Using the Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator Lasso we analyzed all metabolites from the data and identified parsimonious sets of metabolic profiles for distinguishing between cancer and normal tissue In an independent set of samples we could use these models to classify prostate cancer from benign specimens with nearly 90 accuracy per patient Based on previous work in prostate cancer showing that glucose levels are high while citrate is low we found that measurement of the ion signal ratio accurately predicted cancer when this ratio exceeds and normal prostate when the ratio is less than After brief tissue preparation the ratio can be recorded on a tissue sample in 1 min or less which is in sharp contrast to the 20 min or more required by histopathological examination of frozen tissue specimens View details for DOI View details for Web of Science ID 000397607300049 View details for PubMedID 28292895 View details for PubMedCentralID PMC5380053 Novel lincRNA SLINKY is a prognostic biomarker in kidney cancer ONCOTARGET Gong Siprashvili Eminaga Shen Sato Kume Homma Ogawa Khavari Pollack Brooks 2017 8 12 Abstract Clear cell renal cell carcinomas ccRCC show a broad range of clinical behavior and prognostic biomarkers are needed to stratify patients for appropriate management We sought to determine whether long intergenic RNAs lincRNAs might predict patient survival Candidate prognostic lincRNAs were identified by mining The Cancer Genome Atlas TCGA transcriptome data on 466 ccRCC cases randomized into discovery and validation sets annotated for lncRNAs A previously uncharacterized lincRNA SLINKY LINcRNA in KidneY cancer was the prognostic lincRNA and validated in an independent University of Tokyo cohort In multivariable analysis SLINKY expression predicted overall survival independent of tumor stage and grade TCGA CI P Tokyo CI P and by decision tree ROC and decision curve analysis added independent prognostic value In ccRCC cell lines SLINKY knockdown reduced cancer cell proliferation with G1 arrest and induced transcriptome changes enriched for cell proliferation and survival processes Notably the genes affected by SLINKY knockdown in cell lines were themselves prognostic and correlated with SLINKY expression in the ccRCC patient samples From a screen for binding partners we identified direct binding of SLINKY to Heterogeneous Nuclear Ribonucleoprotein K HNRNPK whose knockdown recapitulated SLINKY knockdown phenotypes Thus SLINKY is a robust prognostic biomarker in ccRCC where it functions possibly together with HNRNPK in

SURGICAL PATHOLOGY McKenney Wei Hawley Auman Newcomb Boyer Fazli Simko Troyer Tretiakova Carroll Cooperberg Gleave Lance Lin Nelson Thompson True Feng Brooks 2016 40 11 Abstract Histologic grading remains the gold standard for prognosis in prostate cancer and assessment of Gleason score plays a critical role in active surveillance management We sought to optimize the prognostic stratification of grading and developed a method of recording and studying individual architectural patterns by light microscopic evaluation that is independent of standard Gleason grade Some of the evaluated patterns are not assessed by current Gleason grading eg reactive stromal response Individual histologic patterns were correlated with survival in a retrospective postradical prostatectomy cohort of 1275 patients represented by the foci of carcinoma in tissue microarrays In univariable analysis fibromucinous rupture with varied epithelial complexity had a significantly lower relative risk of survival in cases graded as Cases having focal poorly formed glands which could be designated as pattern had lower risk than cribriform patterns with either small cribriform glands or expansile cribriform growth In separate multivariable Cox proportional hazard analyses of both Gleason score and carcinomas reactive stromal patterns were associated with worse survival Decision tree models demonstrate potential regrouping of architectural patterns into categories with similar risk In summary we argue that Gleason score assignment by current consensus guidelines are not entirely optimized for clinical use including active surveillance Our data suggest that focal poorly formed gland and cribriform patterns currently classified as Gleason pattern 4 should be in separate prognostic groups as the latter is associated with worse outcome Patterns with extravasated mucin are likely overgraded in a subset of cases with more complex epithelial bridges whereas stromogenic cancers have a worse outcome than conveyed by Gleason grade alone These findings serve as a foundation to facilitate optimization of histologic grading and strongly support incorporating reactive

loss is a promising prognostic and predictive biomarker in prostate cancer Because it occurs most commonly via PTEN gene deletion we developed a automated and inexpensive immunohistochemical assay to detect PTEN loss We studied the sensitivity and specificity of PTEN immunohistochemistry relative to fluorescence in situ hybridization FISH for detection of PTEN gene deletion in a cohort of 731 primary prostate tumors Intact PTEN immunostaining was 91 specific for the absence of PTEN gene deletion tumors with two copies of the PTEN gene by FISH showed intact expression of PTEN by immunohistochemistry and 97 sensitive for the presence of homozygous PTEN gene deletion absent PTEN protein expression by immunohistochemistry in tumors with homozygous deletion PTEN immunohistochemistry was 65 sensitive for the presence of hemizygous PTEN gene deletion with protein loss in hemizygous tumors We reviewed the 53 cases where immunohistochemistry showed PTEN protein loss and FISH showed two intact copies of the PTEN gene On there was ambiguous immunohistochemistry loss in 6 and failure to analyze the same tumor area by both methods in 34 Of the remaining discordant cases 41 revealed hemizygous or homozygous PTEN gene deletion that was focal in most cases The remaining 19 cases had two copies of the PTEN gene detected by FISH representing truly discordant cases Our automated PTEN immunohistochemistry assay is a sensitive method for detection of homozygous PTEN gene deletions Immunohistochemistry screening is particularly useful to identify cases with heterogeneous PTEN gene deletion in a subset of tumor glands Mutations small insertions or deletions epigenetic or mechanisms may lead to PTEN protein loss in tumors with normal or

The present study explores the effects of restored GSTP1 expression on glutathione levels accumulation of oxidative DNA damage and prostate cancer cell survival following oxidative stress induced by protracted low dose rate ionizing radiation LDR protein expression was stably restored in LNCaP prostate cancer cells The effect of GSTP1 restoration on protracted oxidative DNA damage was measured by quantitation of modified bases Reduced and oxidized glutathione levels were measured in control and GSTP1 expressing populations Clonogenic survival studies of transfected LNCaP cells after exposure to protracted LDR were performed Global gene expression profiling and pathway analysis were expressing cells accumulated less oxidized DNA base damage and exhibited decreased survival compared to control cells following oxidative injury induced by protracted LDR Restoration of GSTP1 expression resulted in changes in modified glutathione levels that correlated with GSTP1 protein levels in response to protracted oxidative stress Survival differences were not attributable to depletion of cellular glutathione stores Gene expression profiling and pathway analysis following GSTP1 restoration suggests this protein plays a key role in regulating prostate cancer cell ubiquitous epigenetic silencing of GSTP1 in prostate cancer results in enhanced survival and accumulation of

CCRCC by using data extracted from a single computed tomographic CT image Materials and Methods In this institutional review board approved study gene expression profile data and contrast CT images from 70 patients with CCRCC in a training set were independently assessed by two radiologists for a set of predefined imaging features A SOMA for a previously validated supervised principal component SPC risk score prognostic gene signature was constructed and termed the radiogenomic risk score RRS It uses the microarray data and a image array to evaluate each CT image with multiple regression of gene expression analysis The predictive power of the RRS SOMA was then prospectively validated in an independent dataset to confirm its relationship to the SPC gene signature n 70 and determination of patient outcome n 77 Data were analyzed by using multivariate linear methods and Cox regression modeling and significance was assessed with receiver operator characteristic curves and survival analysis Results Our SOMA faithfully represents the molecular assay it models The RRS scaled with the SPC gene signature R P classification accuracy P and predicted survival log rank P Independent validation confirmed the relationship between the RRS and the SPC gene signature R P classification accuracy P and survival P and that it was independent of stage grade and performance status multivariate Cox model P P Conclusion A SOMA for the SPC prognostic gene signature that is predictive of survival and independent of stage was constructed and validated confirming that SOMA construction is feasible RSNA 2015 Online supplemental material is available for this article An earlier incorrect version of this article appeared online This article was corrected on August 24 2015

small tumors felt to be low risk highlighting the difficulties of Gleason scoring in this setting There is an urgent need for predictive biomarkers that can be rapidly deployed to aid in clinical Our

specimens and is accompanied by detailed clinical information with 612 prostate cancers the overall rate of PTEN deletion was 112 Hemizygous PTEN losses were present in of cancers whereas homozygous PTEN deletion was observed in of tumors Significant associations were found between PTEN status and pathologic stage P seminal vesicle invasion P extracapsular extension P and Gleason score P In logistic regression analysis of clinical and pathological variables PTEN deletion was significantly associated with extracapsular extension seminal vesicle involvement and higher Gleason score In the 406 patients in which clinical information was available PTEN homozygous P deletion was associated with worse survival number of events 189 prostate specific antigen PSA P and pathologic stage P status assessed by FISH is an independent predictor for survival in multivariate models as were seminal vesicle invasion extracapsular extension and Gleason score and preoperative PSA Furthermore these data demonstrate that the assay can be readily introduced at first diagnosis in a cost effective manner analogous to the use of FISH for analysis of status in breast cancer Combined with published research beginning 17 years ago both the data and tools now exist to implement a PTEN assay in the clinic Prostate 75 2015 2015 The Authors The Prostate published by Wiley Periodicals View

early stage screen detected prostate cancer who must be treated from those that can be safely watched has become a major issue in prostate cancer care Identification of molecular subtypes of prostate cancer has opened the opportunity for testing whether biomarkers that characterize these subtypes can be used as biomarkers of prognosis Two established molecular subtypes are identified by high expression of the ERG oncoprotein due to structural DNA alterations that encode for fusion transcripts in approximately ½ of prostate cancers and of SPINK1 which is purportedly found only in tumors We used a prostate cancer tissue microarray constructed from radical prostatectomy samples with associated detailed clinical data and with rigorous selection of recurrent and cases to test the prognostic value of immunohistochemistry staining results for the ERG and SPINK1 proteins In univariate analysis ERG positive cases 39 were associated with lower patient age serum PSA levels lower Gleason scores and improved recurrence free survival RFS On multivariate analysis ERG status was not correlated with RFS disease specific survival DSS or overall survival OS SPINK1 protein expression cases 3 was associated with improved RFS on univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis of either protein was not associated with clinical outcome While expression of ERG and SPINK1 proteins was inversely correlated it was not mutually exclusive since 3 cases showed high expression of both While ERG and SPINK1 appear to identify discrete molecular subtypes of prostate cancer only high expression of SPINK1 was associated with improved clinical outcome However by themselves neither ERG nor SPINK1 appear to be useful biomarkers for prognostication of early stage prostate cancer View details for DOI

and other cancers remains analyzed subjects from the Truven Health claims database from 2001 to 2009 Infertile men were identified through diagnosis and treatment codes Comparison groups were created of men who underwent vasectomy and a control cohort of men who were not infertile and had not undergone vasectomy The incidence of cancer was compared to national estimates Infertile men were also compared to men who underwent vasectomy and the control cohort using a Cox regression total of infertile men were identified with an average age of years Overall men who underwent vasectomy and control men were assembled Compared to age adjusted national averages infertile vasectomy and control subjects in the study cohorts had higher rates of all cancers and many individual cancers In time to event analysis infertile men had a higher risk of cancer than those who underwent vasectomy or controls Infertile men had a higher risk of testis cancer nonHodgkin lymphoma and all cancers than the vasectomy and control with prior reports we identified an increased risk of testicular cancer in infertile men The current data also suggest that infertile men are at a mildly increased risk of all

Abstract Overexpression of NUSAP1 is associated with poor prognosis in prostate cancer but little is known about what leads to its overexpression Based on previous observations that NUSAP1 expression is enhanced by E2F1 we hypothesized that NUSAP1 expression is regulated at least in part by loss of RB1 via the Significance Analysis of Microarrays we examined RB1 E2F1 and NUSAP1 transcript levels in prostate cancer gene expression datasets We compared NUSAP1 expression levels in DU145 LNCaP and prostate cancer cell lines via use of cDNA microarray data and Western blots In addition we used lentiviral expression constructs to knockdown RB1 in prostate cancer cell lines and transient transfections to knockdown E2F1 and investigated RB1 E2F1 and NUSAP1 expression levels with and Western blots Finally in DU145 cells or cells that stably underexpress RB1 we used proliferation and invasion assays to assess whether NUSAP1 knockdown affects proliferation or transcript levels are positively correlated with E2F1 and negatively correlated with RB1 transcript levels in prostate cancer microarray datasets NUSAP1 expression is elevated in the DU145 prostate cancer cell line as opposed to LNCaP and cell lines Furthermore NUSAP1 expression increases upon knockdown of RB1 in prostate cancer cell lines LNCaP and and decreases after knockdown of E2F1 Lastly knockdown of NUSAP1 in DU145 cells or cells with stable knockdown of RB1 decreases proliferation and invasion of these studies support the notion that NUSAP1 expression is upregulated by loss of RB1 via the axis in prostate cancer cells Such upregulation may promote prostate cancer progression by increasing proliferation and invasion of prostate cancer cells NUSAP1 may thus represent a novel therapeutic target

study whole genome transcriptome sequencing was performed on 19 specimens of PCa matched adjacent benign prostate tissues matched blood specimens and organ donor prostates A set of novel fusion transcripts was discovered in PCa Eight of these fusion transcripts were validated through multiple approaches The occurrence of these fusion transcripts was then analyzed in 289 prostate samples from three institutes with clinical ranging from 1 to 15 years The analyses indicated that most patients 69 91 of 76 positive for any of these fusion transcripts and experienced PCa recurrence metastases death after radical prostatectomy These outcomes occurred in only 37 of patients without carrying those fusion transcripts Three fusion transcripts occurred exclusively in PCa samples from patients who experienced recurrence or death The formation of these fusion transcripts may be the result of genome recombination A combination of these fusion transcripts in PCa with Gleason grading or with

likely to have an unfavorable risk profile compared to Whites The odds ratios for high disease ranged from 95 CI for Japanese to 95 CI for Filipinos These associations appeared to be driven by higher grade and PSA values rather than advanced clinical stage at this large ethnically diverse cohort we found that men were more likely to have unfavorable risk profiles at diagnosis This association varied by group and nativity and was not attributable to later stage at diagnosis suggesting that Asian men may have biological differences that predispose to the development of more severe disease

different histologic types that greatly influence treatment and prognosis Immunohistochemical studies may be required for accurate classification particularly when these tumors present at extragonadal sites and to aid in distinguishing histologic types Traditional markers for identifying and distinguishing TGCT include PLAP CD117 AFP and CD30 More recently the addition of and SALL4 has increased sensitivity for immunohistochemical detection of germ cell tumors We examined gene expression data from a previously published microarray study that compared normal testis mRNA expression to various TGCT We also performed a search of the literature to identify less markers Glut3 and cyclinA2 showed promise as TGCT markers Therefore we evaluated expression of glut3 and cyclinA2 by immunohistochemistry using tissue microarrays TMAs Of 66 seminomas included in the TMA 64 97 showed positive nuclear staining for cyclinA2 and 58 88 were strongly positive Strong positive staining for cyclinA2 was also seen in the spermatocytic seminoma All 20 of the embryonal carcinomas stained positively with cyclinA2 and 19 95 displayed strong nuclear staining for cyclinA2 Twenty of the 20 embryonal carcinomas stained for glut3 in a strong membranous pattern Of 8 yolk sac tumors 100 stained with glut3 We also evaluated glut3 and cyclinA2 staining on a general TMA containing 486 samples representing 156 different tumors CyclinA2 stained a number of other tumor types but the majority of these were weak or focal staining Glut3 was rarely positive in other tumors interestingly most of these were of ovarian origin We conclude that glut3 is a sensitive 96 and specific 92 marker for embryonal carcinomas and yolk sac tumors Although cyclinA2 is a sensitive marker of seminomas and embryonal carcinomas 98 its specificity is lower if focal and weak staining of nongerm cell tumors is considered positive The sensitivity and specificity of glut3 are comparable with that seen for

cancer is mediated by E2F1 ONCOGENE Gulzar McKenney Brooks 2013 32 1 Abstract Increasing evidence suggests that prostate cancer is overdiagnosed and overtreated and prognostic biomarkers would aid in treatment selection To define prognostic biomarkers for aggressive prostate cancer we carried out profiling of 98 prostate tumors and 52 benign adjacent prostate tissue samples with detailed clinical annotation We identified 28 transcripts significantly associated with recurrence after radical prostatectomy including NuSAP a protein that binds DNA to the mitotic spindle Elevated NuSAP transcript levels were associated with poor outcome in two independent prostate cancer datasets To characterize the role and regulation of NuSAP in prostate cancer we studied the expression of NuSAP in the LNCaP and PC3 human prostate cancer cell lines Posttranscriptional silencing of the NuSAP gene severely hampered the ability of PC3 to invade and proliferate in vitro The promoter region of the NuSAP gene contains two CCAAT boxes and binding sites for E2F Transient transfection of an E2F1 cDNA and 431 bp of the NuSAP promoter demonstrated E2F1 as an important regulator of expression Deletion of the site at nucleotide negated the effects of E2F1 on NuSAP expression Electrophoretic mobility shift assays demonstrated that nuclear extracts of cells overexpressing E2F1 bound directly to the site in the NuSAP promoter region Finally immunohistochemistry showed a strong correlation between E2F1 and NuSAP expression in human prostate cancer samples NuSAP is a novel biomarker for prostate cancer recurrence after surgery and its overexpression appears to be driven in part by E2F1 activation View details for DOI View details for Web of Science ID 000313029500007 View details for PubMedID

by patient age tumor stage and conducted a analysis of men diagnosed with clinically localized T1 or T2 prostate cancer in California during Information on patient characteristics primary treatment and cause of death was obtained from the California Cancer this cohort the most common primary treatment was surgery followed by radiotherapy conservative management and androgen deprivation therapy ADT monotherapy Prostate cancer mortality differed significantly p across treatment groups among patients 80 years at diagnosis with moderately or poorly differentiated disease the mortality rates were generally highest for men treated with ADT monotherapy range 95 to 95 intermediate for men treated with conservative management range 95 to 95 or radiotherapy range 95 to 95 and lowest for men treated with surgery range 95 to 95 mortality estimates provided by this observational study can help patients and physicians better understand the expected outcomes of localized prostate cancer given

by CpG landscape GENOME BIOLOGY Day Waite West Bamman Brooks Myers Absher 2013 14 9 Abstract DNA methylation is an epigenetic modification that changes with age in human tissues although the mechanisms and specificity of this process are still poorly understood We compared CpG methylation changes with age across 283 human blood brain kidney and skeletal muscle samples using methylation arrays to identify age found CpGs ageCGs that are both and common across tissues ageCGs are frequently located outside CpG islands with decreased methylation and common ageCGs show the opposite trend AgeCGs are significantly associated with poorly expressed genes but those with decreasing methylation are linked with higher expression levels compared with increasing methylation Therefore gene expression may protect against common methylation Distinguished from other tissues skeletal muscle ageCGs are more associated with expression enriched near genes related to myofiber contraction and closer to CTCF binding sites ageCGs are more increasingly methylated compared to other tissues as measured by affiliation with expressed genes Underlying chromatin features also mark common and age effects reflective of poised and active chromatin states respectively In contrast with decreasingly methylated ageCGs increasingly methylated ageCGs are also generally further from CTCF binding sites and enriched within lamina associated data identified common and DNA methylation changes with age that are reflective of CpG landscape and suggests both common and unique alterations within human tissues Our findings also indicate that a simple epigenetic drift model is insufficient to explain all changes in DNA methylation View details for DOI View details for Web of Science ID

Circulating Tumor Cells Reveals Recapitulation of Gene Expression and Pathways Found in Prostate Cancer PLOS ONE Cann Gulzar Cooper Li Luo Tat Stuart Schroth Srinivas Ronaghi Brooks Talasaz 2012 7 11 Abstract Circulating tumor cells CTC mediate metastatic spread of many solid tumors and enumeration of CTCs is currently used as a prognostic indicator of survival in metastatic prostate cancer patients Some evidence suggests that it is possible to derive additional information about tumors from expression analysis of CTCs but the technical difficulty of isolating and analyzing individual CTCs has limited progress in this area To assess the ability of a new generation of MagSweeper to isolate intact CTCs for downstream analysis we performed on single CTCs isolated from the blood of patients with metastatic prostate cancer and on single prostate cancer cell line LNCaP cells spiked into the blood of healthy donors We found that the MagSweeper effectively isolated CTCs with a capture efficiency that matched the CellSearch platform However unlike CellSearch the MagSweeper facilitates isolation of individual live CTCs without contaminating leukocytes Importantly analysis showed that the MagSweeper isolation process did not have a discernible impact on the transcriptional profile of single LNCaPs isolated from spiked human blood suggesting that any perturbations caused by the MagSweeper process on the transcriptional signature of isolated cells are modest Although the RNA from patient CTCs showed signs of significant degradation consistent with reports of short and apoptosis amongst CTCs transcriptional signatures of prostate tissue and of cancer were readily detectable with single CTC These results demonstrate that the MagSweeper provides access to intact CTCs and that these CTCs can potentially supply clinically relevant information View details for DOI View details for Web of Science ID 000311935800219 View details for PubMedID 23145101 View details for

comparative genomic hybridization CGH on 86 primary prostate tumors Among the most frequent alterations not associated with a known cancer gene we identified focal deletions within 5q21 in 15 out of 86 17 cases By tiling array CGH the smallest common deletion targeted just one gene the chromatin remodeler chromodomain helicase protein 1 CHD1 Expression of CHD1 was significantly reduced in tumors

knockdown of CHD1 in two nontumorigenic prostate epithelial cell lines OPCN2 and did not alter cell growth but promoted cell invasiveness and in cell clonogenicity Taken together our findings suggest

with clinical Stage T1c n 783 and T2 n 676 disease who underwent surgery from 1988 to 2003 with detailed morphometric mapping We generated receiver operating characteristic curves for PSA levels according to the total and Gleason score 4 or 5 cancer volume and compared the areas under the curve AUC for the various total and cancer patients with Stage T1c disease the AUC for the PSA ROC curve increased in a stepwise fashion as both the total cancer volume and the cancer volume increased Significant differences between the AUCs for low and high volumes of total and disease were observed For T2 disease the AUCs for predicting cancer volume were generally greater than the corresponding AUCs for T1c disease although no incremental increase was patients with Stage T1c disease in whom the PSA level was the driving force for biopsy the PSA performance improved in a stepwise fashion with greater total and cancer volumes as evidenced by improved ROC Previous studies have shown that PSA

Ubiquitin Ligase Bre1 Leads to Replication Stress and Chromosomal Instability CANCER RESEARCH Chernikova Razorenova Higgins Sishc Nicolau Dorth J Chernikova Kwok Brooks Bailey Game Brown 2012 72 8 Abstract Mammalian Bre1 complexes in humans and in mice function similarly to their yeast homolog Bre1 as ubiquitin ligases in monoubiquitination of histone H2B This ubiquitination facilitates methylation of histone H3 at K4 and K79 and accounts for the roles of Bre1 and its homologs in transcriptional regulation Recent studies by others suggested that Bre1 acts as a tumor suppressor augmenting expression of select tumor suppressor genes and suppressing select oncogenes In this study we present an additional mechanism of tumor suppression by Bre1 through maintenance of genomic stability We track the evolution of genomic instability in cells from breaks DSB to specific genomic rearrangements that explain a rapid increase in DNA content and trigger cycles We show that aberrant structures constitute a significant source of DSBs in cells Combined with a previously reported defect in homologous recombination generation of is a likely initiator of replication stress and genomic instability in cells We propose that genomic instability triggered by Bre1 deficiency may be an important early step that precedes acquisition of an invasive phenotype as we find decreased

been compared on a large scale between prostate tumor and normal prostate and the mechanisms behind these alterations are unknown In this study we quantitatively profiled 95 primary prostate tumors and 86 benign adjacent prostate tissue samples for their DNA methylation levels at CpGs representing gene promoters by using the Illumina HumanMethylation27 platform A Significance Analysis of this

needed to stratify patients for appropriately aggressive therapy By expression profiling we can identify a proliferation signature variably expressed in prostate cancers Here we asked whether one or more tissue biomarkers might capture that information and provide prognostic utility We assayed three proliferation signature genes MKI67 also a classic proliferation biomarker TOP2A DNA topoisomerase

included in the same model however both were highly predictive for biochemical recurrence in separate multivariate models for both Both also correlated with cancer specific survival as single variables however in separate multivariate models only tumor volume predicted death while percent cancer did not volume and percent cancer are independent predictors of recurrence after radical

distinction of chordoma from clear cell renal cell carcinoma and germ cell tumors a study of 305 cases MODERN PATHOLOGY Sangoi Karamchandani Lane Higgins Rouse Brooks McKenney 2011 24 3 Abstract Brachyury is recognized as a specific marker for tissues and neoplasms and has become a defining immunohistochemical feature of chordoma The main differential diagnostic consideration for chordoma is chondrosarcoma which is known to lack brachyury expression However within the spectrum of genitourinary neoplasia metastatic germ cell tumors and clear cell renal cell carcinoma may also be close morphological mimics of chordoma particularly given the increasing prevalence of small tissue samples from biopsies Although immunoreactivity for brachyury has been reported in a few germ cell tumors a thorough characterization of staining by specific subtype has not been performed in a large series Additionally brachyury expression in clear cell renal cell carcinoma has not been well studied In this study immunohistochemical expression with the brachyury antibody was evaluated in 111 germ cell tumors 30 and neoplastic cell testicular tissues and 184 metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinomas using tissue microarray technology In addition immunoreactivity for and was evaluated in 12 chordomas on whole section No nuclear brachyury expression was identified in any of the 101 germ cell tumors within the tissue microarray including choriocarcinoma 1 embryonal carcinoma 20 intratubular germ cell neoplasia unclassified 2 seminoma 64 spermatocytic seminoma 1 teratoma 5 and yolk sac tumor 8 in any of the 30 and neoplastic cell testicular tissues or in any of the 10 seminomas All 184 metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinomas were also for brachyury All 12 chordomas showed strong nuclear immunoreactivity for brachyury but no expression of In all 1 of 12 chordoma cases showed patchy nuclear immunoreactivity for This study confirms the specificity of brachyury for chordoma in

during development of the genitourinary tract including the kidney and both and tissues Expression of by immunohistochemistry has been studied mainly in renal epithelial neoplasms with little attention to the lower male genitourinary tract We studied expression in epithelium of normal seminal vesicle normal ejaculatory duct normal prostatic secretory epithelium and prostatic adenocarcinoma to define its immunoreactivity pattern throughout the prostate gland and to evaluate its potential diagnostic role in the discrimination of seminal duct epithelium from prostatic adenocarcinoma In addition given that is highly expressed in tissues of wolffian duct embryologic origin we also sought to confirm the divergent embryogenesis of the central zone seminal vesicle and ejaculatory duct from other regions of the prostate Prostatectomy specimens from 12 patients were reviewed to identify blocks containing seminal vesicle ejaculatory duct periurethral glands benign prostatic glands and prostatic acinar adenocarcinoma A total of 35 blocks from the 12 patients were evaluated In addition 2 tissue microarrays representing 15 additional seminal vesicles and 45 prostatic adenocarcinomas 7 whole sections from prostatic adenocarcinomas of the central zone and 5 core needle biopsies of seminal vesicle were also evaluated with antibody In the 12 radical prostatectomy whole sections nuclear reactivity for was identified in 12 100 of 12 of the seminal vesicle epithelium 9 90 of 10 of the ejaculatory duct epithelium 0 of 12 of the prostatic adenocarcinoma and 0 of 6 of the prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia All 20 total additional seminal vesicles were positive for in the tissue microarray and biopsies and all 52 additional prostatic adenocarcinomas were negative including 7 of central zone origin The staining intensity and percentage of immunoreactive cells in seminal vesicle were both in all cases Although the ejaculatory ducts also showed diffuse staining their staining intensity was less than that in the seminal vesicles particularly in the ejaculatory ducts in the periurethral area The smaller glands surrounding the main seminal vesicle duct also showed less intense staining than the luminal cells of the main duct Of the 19 total cases with evaluable central zone glands 2 had focal nuclear reactivity in normal benign prostatic secretory cells All other benign prostatic secretory epithelia from the peripheral and transition zones were negative for In conclusion nuclear immunoreactivity is typical in epithelium of the seminal vesicle and ejaculatory duct but the intensity of staining is less in the ejaculatory duct No reactivity for was seen in prostatic adenocarcinoma or prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia has diagnostic utility as a positive immunohistochemical marker of seminal vesicle and ejaculatory duct epithelium In addition these data add further support to the proposed embryogenesis of the prostatic central zone seminal vesicle and ejaculatory ducts from the wolffian system View details for DOI View details for Web of Science ID 000280128300011 View details for PubMedID 20413145 Canary Prostate Active Surveillance Study Design

Ganesan Bhanot Rathmell 2010 1 2 Abstract Clear cell renal cell carcinoma ccRCC is the predominant RCC subtype but even within this classification the natural history is heterogeneous and difficult to predict A sophisticated understanding of the molecular features most discriminatory for the underlying tumor heterogeneity should be predicated on identifiable and biologically meaningful patterns of gene expression Gene expression microarray data were analyzed using software that implements iterative unsupervised consensus clustering algorithms to identify the optimal molecular subclasses without clinical or other classifying information ConsensusCluster analysis identified two distinct subtypes of ccRCC within the training set designated clear cell type A ccA and B ccB Based on the core tumors or most arrays in each subtype logical analysis of data LAD defined a small highly predictive gene set that could then be used to classify additional tumors individually The subclasses were corroborated in a validation data set of 177 tumors and analyzed for clinical outcome Based on individual tumor assignment tumors designated ccA have markedly improved survival compared to ccB median survival of vs years P Analyzed by both univariate and multivariate analysis the classification schema was independently associated with survival Using patterns of gene expression based on a defined gene set ccRCC was classified into two robust subclasses based on inherent molecular features that ultimately correspond to marked differences in clinical outcome This classification schema thus provides a molecular stratification applicable to individual tumors that has implications to influence treatment decisions define biological mechanisms involved in ccRCC tumor progression and direct

programs controlled by the and by programming during embryonic development To enable experimental dissection of these components in the human we performed profiling of the transcriptomes of peripheral blood mononuclear cells PBMC in patients with rare defined disorders of sex development DSD 46 due to defective androgen biosynthesis compared to normal 46 and 46 discrete set of transcripts was directly correlated with XY or XX genotypes in all individuals independent of male or female phenotype of the external genitalia However a significantly larger gene set in the PBMC only reflected the degree of external genital masculinization independent of the sex chromosomes and independent of concurrent sex steroid hormone levels Consequently the architecture of the transcriptional sexes was either male female or even intersex with a discordant alignment of the DSD individuals genetic and hormonal sex significant fraction of gene expression differences between males and females in the human appears to have its roots in early embryogenesis and is not only caused by sex chromosomes but also by hormonal programming due to presence or absence of androgen during the time of external genital masculinization Genetic sex and the androgen milieu during embryonic development might therefore independently modulate functional traits phenotype and diseases associated with male or female gender as well as with DSD conditions View details for DOI View details for Web of Science ID 000268754800001 View details for PubMedID 19570224 Alteration of Gene Expression Signatures of Cortical Differentiation and Wound Response in Lethal Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinomas PLOS ONE Zhao Ma Tibshirani Higgins Ljungberg Brooks 2009 4 6 Abstract Clear cell renal cell carcinoma ccRCC is the most common malignancy of the adult kidney and displays heterogeneity in clinical outcomes Through comprehensive gene expression profiling we have identified previously a set of transcripts that predict survival following nephrectomy independent of tumor stage grade and performance status These transcripts designated as the SPC supervised principal components gene set show no apparent biological or genetic features that provide insight into renal carcinogenesis or tumor progression We explored the relationship of this gene list to a set of genes expressed in different anatomical segments of the normal kidney including the cortex cortex gene set and the glomerulus glomerulus gene set and a gene set expressed after serum stimulation of quiescent fibroblasts the core serum response or CSR gene set Interestingly the normal cortex glomerulus part of the normal renal cortex and CSR gene sets captured more than of the genes in the highly prognostic SPC gene set Based on gene expression patterns alone the SPC gene set could be used to sort samples from normal adult kidneys by the anatomical regions from which they were dissected Tumors whose gene expression profiles most resembled the normal renal cortex or glomerulus showed better survival than those that did not and those with expression features more similar to CSR showed poorer survival While the cortex glomerulus and CSR signatures predicted survival independent of traditional clinical parameters they were not independent of the SPC gene list Our findings suggest that critical biological features of lethal ccRCC include loss of normal cortical differentiation and activation of programs associated with wound healing View details for DOI View details for Web of Science ID 000267356900003 View details for PubMedID 19557179 View

Demeter Hiort Riepe Brooks Holterhus 2009 87 6 Abstract Androgen insensitivity syndrome AIS is the most common cause of disorders of sex development usually caused by mutations in the androgen receptor AR gene AIS is characterized by a poor correlation and many patients with clinically presumed AIS do not seem to have mutations in the AR gene We therefore aimed at identifying a biomarker enabling the assessment of the cellular function of the AR as a transcriptional activator In the first step we used complementary DNA cDNA microarrays for a screen for genes in two normal male primary scrotal skin fibroblast strains compared to two labia majora fibroblast strains from 46 XY females with complete AIS CAIS Apolipoprotein D APOD and two further transcripts were significantly upregulated by dihydrotestosterone DHT in scrotum fibroblasts while CAIS labia majora cells were unresponsive Microarray data were well correlated with quantitative polymerase chain reaction R Subsequently we used in independent new cell cultures and confirmed the significant upregulation of APOD in five normal scrotum strains SD compared with three CAIS strains p t test and six partial androgen insensitivity syndrome strains 2 p t test Moreover two different dehydrogenase III deficiency labia majora strains showed APOD induction in the range of normal scrotum supporting AR specificity Therefore of APOD messenger RNA transcription in primary cultures of labioscrotal skin fibroblasts is a promising tool for assessing AR function potentially allowing a diagnostic

INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CANCER Swami Krishnan Moreno Bhattacharya Gardner Brooks Peehl Feldman 2009 124 9 Abstract Soy and its constituent isoflavone genistein inhibit the development and progression of prostate cancer PCa Our study in both cultured cells and PCa patients reveals a novel pathway for the actions of genistein namely the inhibition of the synthesis and biological actions of prostaglandins PGs known stimulators of PCa growth In the cell culture experiments genistein decreased mRNA and protein expression in both human PCa cell lines LNCaP and and primary prostate epithelial cells and increased dehydrogenase mRNA levels in primary prostate cells As a result genistein significantly reduced the secretion of PGE 2 by these cells EP4 and FP PG receptor mRNA were also reduced by genistein providing an additional mechanism for the suppression of PG biological effects Further the growth stimulatory effects of both exogenous PGs and endogenous PGs derived from precursor arachidonic acid were attenuated by genistein We also performed a pilot randomised double blind clinical study in which placebo or soy isoflavone supplements were given to PCa patients in the setting for 2 weeks before prostatectomy Gene expression changes were measured in the prostatectomy specimens In PCa patients ingesting isoflavones we observed significant decreases in prostate mRNA and increases in p21 mRNA There were significant correlations between mRNA suppression p21 mRNA stimulation and serum isoflavone levels We propose that the inhibition of the PG pathway

in Human Prostate Cancer Cells PROSTATE Bhamre Sahoo Tibshirani Dill Brooks 2009 69 2 Abstract Prostate cancer is thought to arise as a result of oxidative stresses and induction of antioxidant electrophile defense phase 2 enzymes has been proposed as a prostate cancer prevention strategy The isothiocyanate sulforaphane derived from cruciferous vegetables like broccoli potently induces surrogate markers of phase 2 enzyme activity in prostate cells in vitro and in vivo To better understand the temporal effects of sulforaphane and broccoli sprouts on gene expression in prostate cells we carried out comprehensive transcriptome analysis using cDNA significantly modulated by sulforaphane over time were identified using StepMiner analysis Ingenuity Pathway Analysis IPA was used to identify biological pathways networks and functions significantly altered by sulforaphane and IPA revealed significant changes in many transcripts associated with cell growth and cell cycle as well as a significant number associated with cellular response to oxidative damage and stress Comparison to an existing dataset suggested that sulforaphane blocked cell growth by inducing arrest Cell growth assays and flow cytometry analysis confirmed that sulforaphane inhibited cell growth and induced cell cycle data suggest that in prostate cells sulforaphane primarily induces cellular defenses and inhibits cell growth by causing phase arrest Furthermore based on the striking similarities in the gene expression patterns induced across experiments in these cells sulforaphane appears to be the primary bioactive compound present in broccoli sprouts suggesting that broccoli sprouts can serve as a suitable source for sulforaphane in intervention trials View details for DOI View details for Web

tumors exhibited characteristic deletions at 5q21 and 6q15 and cases harbored deletions at 8p21 and 21q22 resulting in fusion Lymph node metastases predominantly displayed overall higher frequencies of CNA and in particular gains at 8q24 MYC and 16p13 and loss at 10q23 PTEN and 16q23 Our findings reveal that prostate cancers develop via a limited number of alternative preferred genetic pathways The resultant molecular genetic subtypes provide a new framework for investigating prostate cancer biology and explain in part the clinical heterogeneity of the disease View details for DOI View

DNA microarray AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SURGICAL PATHOLOGY Higgins Kaygusuz Wang Montgomery Mason Zhu Marinelli Presti van de Rijn Brooks 2007 31 5 Abstract The morphologic distinction between prostate and urothelial carcinoma can be difficult To identify novel diagnostic markers that may aid in the differential diagnosis of prostate versus urothelial carcinoma we analyzed expression patterns in prostate and bladder cancer tissues using complementary DNA microarrays Together with our prior studies on renal neoplasms and normal kidney these studies suggested that the gene for placental S100 S100P is specifically expressed in benign and malignant urothelial cells Using tissue microarrays a polyclonal antiserum against S100P protein stained 86 of 295 urothelial carcinomas while only 3 of 260 prostatic adenocarcinomas and 1 of 133 renal cell carcinomas stained A commercially available monoclonal antibody against S100P stained 78 of 300 urothelial carcinomas while only 2 of 256 prostatic adenocarcinomas and none of 137 renal cell carcinomas stained A second gene GATA3 also showed high level expression in urothelial tumors by cDNA array A commercially available monoclonal antibody against GATA3 stained 67 of 308 urothelial carcinomas but none of the prostate or renal carcinomas For comparison staining was also performed for p63 and cytokeratin p63 stained 87 of urothelial carcinomas whereas stained 54 Importantly when S100P and p63 were combined 95 of urothelial carcinomas were labeled by one or both markers We conclude that the detection of S100P and GATA3

androgen receptor in and prostate cancer cells NUCLEIC ACIDS RESEARCH Li Zhao Peng Beliakoff Brooks Sun Z 2007 35 8 Abstract Although the vital role of the androgen receptor AR has been well demonstrated in primary prostate cancers its role in the prostate cancers still remains unclear Here we used a small hairpin RNA approach to directly assess AR activity in prostate cancer cells Reduction of AR expression in the two prostate cancer cell lines LNCaP and LAPC4 significantly decreased transcription and cell growth Intriguingly in two prostate cell lines and CWR22Rv1 knockdown of AR expression showed a more pronounced effect on transcription and cell growth than androgen depletion Using cDNA microarrays we also compared the transcriptional profiles induced by either androgen depletion or AR knockdown Although a significant number of transcripts appear to be regulated by both androgen depletion and AR knockdown we observed a subset of transcripts affected only by androgen depletion but not by AR knockdown and vice versa Finally we demonstrated a direct role for AR in promoting tumor formation and growth in a xenograft model Taken together our results elucidate an important role for the AR in prostate cancer cells and suggest that AR can be used as a therapeutic target for prostate cancers View details for DOI View details for Web of Science ID 000247239600029

PATHOLOGY Lapointe Kim Miller Li Kaygusuz van de Rijn Huntsman Brooks Pollack 2007 20 4 Abstract Prostate cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer among men in the United States Recently fusion of TMPRSS2 with ETS family oncogenic transcription factors has been identified as a common molecular alteration in prostate cancer where most often the rearrangement places ERG under the transcriptional control of TMPRSS2 Here we carried out rapid amplification of cDNA ends RACE on a prostate cancer specimen carrying an atypical aberration discovered by comparative genomic hybridization array CGH suggesting an alternative fusion partner of ERG We identified novel transcribed sequences fused to ERG mapping 4 kb upstream of the TMPRSS2 start site The sequences derive from an apparent second

Werner Deppe Demeter Hiort Holterhus 2006 84 11 Abstract Normal genital skin fibroblasts GSF and the human prostate carcinoma cell line LNCaP have been used widely as cell culture models of genital origin to study androgen receptor AR signaling We demonstrate that LNCaP shows a reproducible response to androgens as assessed using representing approximately unique human genes whereas several independent GSF strains are virtually unresponsive We show that LNCaP cells express markedly higher AR protein levels likely contributing to the observed differences of androgen responsiveness However previous data suggested that levels alone do not determine androgen responsiveness of human GSF compared to LNCaP We hypothesized that differences in expression levels of AR coregulators might

Abstract BACKGROUND A previous clinical trial showed that selenium supplementation significantly reduced the incidence of prostate cancer We report here a bioinformatics approach to gain new insights into selenium molecular targets that might be relevant to prostate cancer chemoprevention MATERIALS AND METHODS We first performed data mining analysis to identify genes which are consistently dysregulated in prostate cancer using published datasets from gene expression profiling of clinical prostate specimens We then devised a method to systematically analyze three selenium microarray datasets from the LNCaP human prostate cancer cells and to match the analysis to the cohort of genes implicated in prostate carcinogenesis Moreover we compared the selenium datasets with two datasets obtained from expression profiling of LNCaP cells RESULTS We found that selenium reverses the expression of genes implicated in prostate carcinogenesis In addition we found that selenium could counteract the effect of androgen on the expression of a subset obtained from genes CONCLUSIONS The above information provides us with a treasure of new clues to investigate the mechanism of selenium

at least one relative with prostate cancer N 103 were compared with those with no family history N 456 In addition the patients were stratified into two groups those treated from 1989 through 1992 and those treated after 1992 In the entire cohort from 1989 through 2000 patients with a family history had a greater proportion of tumors than the NFH group P From 1989 to 1992 there was no statistical difference between patients with a family history FH and those without a family history NFH with respect to age prostate specific antigen PSA PSA density clinical or pathologic stage Gleason grade or total tumor volume However after 1992 the FH group tended to be younger than the NFH group P and have a lower PSA P at the time of diagnosis We believe these differences are predominantly driven by

organization of the nephron the functional unit of the kidney has a consistent relationship to the macroscopic anatomy of the kidney knowledge of the characteristic patterns of gene expression in different compartments of the kidney could provide insight into the functions and functional organization of the normal nephron We studied gene expression in dissected renal lobes of five adult human

Immunohistochemical staining using selected antisera confirmed differential expression of several cognate proteins and provided histological localization of expression within the nephron The

in vitro To gain insights into the effects of MSA in prostate cancer we characterized the global transcriptional response of LNCaP an human prostate cancer cell line to MSA by using cDNA microarrays We identified 951 genes whose expression shows striking and changes in response to microM MSA over the time course of 48 Transcript levels of many cell genes change in response to MSA suggesting that MSA inhibits proliferation Consistent with these gene expression changes cell proliferation monitored by carboxyfluoroscein succinimidyl ester staining was decreased after MSA treatment and an accumulation of cells at phase was detected by flow cytometry Surprisingly MSA also modulated expression of many genes suppressed androgen receptor AR expression at both mRNA and protein level and decreased levels of prostate specific antigen secreted into the medium Low concentrations of MSA also induced significant increases in transcript levels of phase 2 detoxification enzymes and induced NADPH dehydrogenase quinone 1 enzymatic activity a surrogate marker of global phase 2 enzyme activity Our results suggest that MSA may protect against prostate cancer by inhibiting cell proliferation

death displays a broad range of clinical behavior from relatively indolent to aggressive metastatic disease To explore potential molecular variation underlying this clinical heterogeneity we profiled gene expression in 62 primary prostate tumors as well as 41 normal prostate specimens and nine lymph node metastases using cDNA microarrays containing approximately genes Unsupervised hierarchical clustering readily distinguished tumors from normal samples and further identified three subclasses of prostate tumors based on distinct patterns of gene expression and advanced stage tumors as well as tumors associated with recurrence were disproportionately represented among two of the three subtypes one of which also included most lymph node metastases To further characterize the clinical relevance of tumor subtypes we evaluated as surrogate markers two genes differentially expressed among tumor subgroups by using immunohistochemistry on tissue microarrays representing an independent set of 225 prostate tumors Positive staining for MUC1 a gene highly expressed in the subgroups with aggressive clinicopathological features was associated with an elevated risk of recurrence P whereas strong staining for AZGP1 a gene highly expressed in the other subgroup was associated with a decreased risk of recurrence P In multivariate analysis MUC1 and AZGP1 staining were strong predictors of tumor recurrence independent of tumor grade stage and preoperative antigen levels Our results suggest that prostate tumors can be usefully classified according to their gene expression patterns and

phenotypes from male infertility to complete feminization Most individuals with AIS carry germline mutations of the androgen receptor AR that interfere with or ablate its function As genital fibroblasts retain expression of the AR in vitro we used genital skin fibroblasts from normal males and 46 XY females with complete AIS due to known AR mutations to gain insights into the role of the AR in human genital DNA microarrays representing different genes we identified 404 transcripts with significant differences in transcription levels between genital skin fibroblasts cultured from normal and individuals analyses uncovered coordinated expression of genes involved in key processes of morphogenesis On the basis of animal studies and human genetic syndromes several of these genes are known to have specific roles in genital differentiation Remarkably genital fibroblasts from both normal and individuals showed no transcriptional response to dihydrotestosterone treatment despite expression of the results suggest that in addition to differences in the anatomic origin of the cells androgen signaling during prenatal development contributes to setting transcriptional programs in

binding protein that interacts with calcineurin and thereby mediates the immunosuppressive effects of FK506 Because initial immunohistochemical staining showed abundant expression of FKBP12 in vascular endothelial cells we evaluated whether it could serve as a marker for vascular neoplasms We performed immunohistochemical staining of conventional sections from tissue from 59 benign and malignant vascular neoplasms using a polyclonal rabbit antiserum against FKBP12 Western blot analysis of tissue from 6 angiosarcomas showed a single band at 12 kD consistent with the published molecular weight for the FKBP12 protein Together CD31 CD34 and FKBP12 identified all 59 vascular neoplasms in this study Specificity of immunohistochemical staining was assessed on tissues represented on 7 tissue microarrays All proteins were occasionally expressed in tissue Six of 8 vascular neoplasms represented on the arrays stained for FKBP12 as did normal vessels in numerous cores The polyclonal antiserum shows comparable sensitivity and specificity to CD34 and CD31 and may be a useful additional marker for vascular differentiation Because we have evaluated a large number of tissues by tissue microarray we anticipate that our estimate of the specificity of immunostaining for FKBP12 as a marker for vascular endothelium will be accurate In addition our findings may explain

glutathione GSTP1 We hypothesize that a prostate cancer preventive strategy could involve induction of phase 2 enzymes within the prostate to compensate for the loss of GSTP1 expression NAD P H oxidoreductase quinone reductase or QR enzymatic activity a surrogate of phase 2 enzyme response was measured after treating the human prostate cancer cell line LNCaP with known phase 2 agents from 10 distinct chemical classes QR enzymatic activity was assayed in microtiter plates using the reduction of tetrazolium dye Degree of induction was expressed as over control and corrected for toxicity Compounds were also tested in an LNCaP subline selected in that expresses GSTP1 and in the human liver cell line HepG2 LNCaP showed robust induction of QR enzymatic activity after treatment with a subset of the phase 2 agents All Michael acceptors were effective at inducing QR activity in LNCaP Some phenolic antioxidants heavy metal salts and quinones also significantly increased QR activity although inducer potency varied widely within these classes of compounds Some of the isothiocyanates mercaptans bifunctional inducers and trivalent arsenicals also produced modest QR induction but peroxides and dithiolethiones were inactive and LNCaP responded similarly to all compounds but the pattern of response for HepG2 differed significantly The differences in QR responsiveness between the prostate cell lines and HepG2 suggest that prostate tissues may have a unique pattern of response to phase agents distinct from other tissue types Our data suggest that measurement of QR induction in

positively regulate senescence are required for immortalization To identify these pathways in an unbiased manner we performed DNA microarray analyses to assess the expression of genes in human prostate epithelial cells HPECs passaged to senescence These gene expression patterns were then compared with those of HPECs immortalized with the human Papillomavirus 16 E7 oncoprotein Senescent cells display gene expression patterns that reflect their nonproliferative differentiated phenotype and express secretory proteases and extracellular matrix components A comparison of genes transcriptionally in senescence to those in which expression is significantly in immortalized HPECs identified three genes the chemokine BRAK DOC1 and a member of the growth factor axis Expression of these genes is found to be uniformly lost in human prostate cancer cell lines and xenografts and previously their inactivation was documented in tumor samples Thus these genes may function in novel

both normal prostate development and prostate carcinogenesis We used DNA microarrays representing approximately genes to examine the temporal program of gene expression following treatment of the human prostate cancer cell line LNCaP with a synthetic observed statistically significant changes in levels of transcripts of more than 500 genes Many of these genes were previously reported androgen

many features with those observed in LNCaP but some differences were observed A remarkable fraction of the genes induced by androgen appeared to be related to production of seminal fluid and these genes included many with roles in protein folding trafficking and cancer cell lines retain features of androgen responsiveness that reflect normal prostatic physiology These results provide a broad

JOURNAL OF PATHOLOGY Lin Tascilar Lee Vles Lee Veeraswamy Asgari Freije Van Rees Gage Bova Isaacs Brooks DeWeese De Marzo Nelson 2001 159 5 Abstract GSTP1 CpG island hypermethylation is the most common somatic genome alteration described for human prostate cancer PCA lack of GSTP1 expression is characteristic of human PCA cells in vivo We report here that loss of GSTP1 function may have been selected during the pathogenesis of human PCA Using a variety of techniques to detect GSTP1 CpG island DNA hypermethylation in PCA DNA we found only hypermethylated GSTP1 alleles in each PCA cell in all but two PCA cases studied In these two cases CpG island hypermethylation was present at only one of two GSTP1 alleles in PCA DNA In one of the cases DNA hypermethylation at one GSTP1 allele and deletion of the other GSTP1 allele were evident In the other case an unmethylated GSTP1 allele was detected accompanied by abundant GSTP1 expression GSTP1 CpG island DNA hypermethylation was responsible for lack of GSTP1 expression by LNCaP PCA cells treatment of the cells with an inhibitor of DNA methyltransferases reversed the GSTP1 promoter DNA hypermethylation activated GSTP1 transcription and restored GSTP1 expression GSTP1 promoter activity assessed via transfection of GSTP1 reporter constructs in LNCaP cells was inhibited by CpG dinucleotide methylation Remarkably although selection for loss of GSTP1 function may be inferred for human PCA GSTP1 did not act like a tumor suppressor gene as LNCaP cells expressing GSTP1 either after treatment or as a consequence of transfection with GSTP1 cDNA grew well in vitro and in vivo Perhaps GSTP1 inactivation may render prostatic cells susceptible to additional genome alterations caused by electrophilic or oxidant

Prostate cancer is characterized by an early and near universal loss of expression of the phase 2 enzyme glutathione GST We tested whether sulforaphane may act in prostatic cells by increasing phase 2

Quinone reductase enzymatic activity a surrogate of global phase 2 enzyme activity was assayed by the reduction of tetrazolium dye Expression of and chains and microsomal GST was assessed by Northern blot analysis Sulforaphane and broccoli sprout extract potently induce quinone reductase activity in cultured prostate cells and this induction appears to be mediated by increased transcription of the gene Sulforaphane also induces expression of synthetase light subunit but not the heavy subunit and this induction is associated with moderate increases in intracellular glutathione levels Microsomal and glutathione transferases were also induced transcriptionally Sulforaphane induces phase 2 enzyme expression and activity significantly in human prostatic cells This induction is accompanied by but not because of increased intracellular glutathione synthesis Our findings may help explain the observed inverse correlation between consumption of cruciferae and prostate cancer risk View details for

than with the granules that characterize benign secretory cells or the nongranular protein matrix of other prostate cancers We reasoned that grade 1 cancer might also have additional distinctive cellular features we tested this hypothesis by observations on 17 grade 1 carcinoma foci found as components of transition zone cancers Unlike BPH secretory cells cells of grade 1 cancer were uniformly large with even straight borders laterally and luminally Nuclei appeared sometimes benign but were fixed in a basal row dissimilar to the uneven distribution in BPH Nuclear pyknotic foci cytoplasm and abundant dense luminal secretion were distinctively common Immunostain for transferase was negative in grade 1 cancer but lightly positive in BPH secretory cells These cytologic findings were proposed to be useful as diagnostic clues especially in biopsy samples in which architecture may be difficult to interpret HUM PATHOL View details for PubMedID 11331962 Preneoplastic prostate lesions An opportunity for prostate cancer prevention 4th Strang International Cancer Prevention Conference Nelson De Marzo DeWeese Lin Brooks Putzi Nelson Groopman Kensler NEW YORK ACAD SCIENCES 2001 Abstract Environmental factors especially the diet play a prominent role in the epidemic of prostate cancer PCA in the United States Many candidate dietary components have been proposed to influence human prostatic carcinogenesis including fat calories fruits and vegetables and various micronutrients but the specific roles dietary agents play in promoting or preventing PCA remain controversial We have collected evidence to suggest that GSTP1 the gene encoding the glutathione GST may serve a caretaker function for prostatic cells Although GSTP1 can be detected in normal prostatic epithelium in almost all PCA cases PCA cells fail to express GSTP1 polypeptides and lack of GSTP1 expression most often appears to be the result of somatic CpG island DNA methylation changes Loss of GSTP1 function also appears to be characteristic of prostatic epithelial neoplasia PIN lesions thought to represent PCA precursors We have recently learned that a new candidate early PCA precursor lesion proliferative inflammatory atrophy PIA characterized by proliferating prostatic cells juxtaposed to inflammatory cells contains epithelial cells that express high levels of GSTP1 These findings have formed the basis for a new model of prostatic carcinogenesis in which prostatic cells in PIA lesions subjected to a barrage of inflammatory oxidants induce GSTP1 expression as a defense against oxidative genome damage When cells with defective GSTP1 genes appear amongst the PIA cells such cells become vulnerable to oxidants and electrophiles that inflict genome damage that tends to promote neoplastic transformation to PIN and PCA cells Subsequently PIN and PCA cells with defective GSTPI genes remain vulnerable to similar stresses tending to promote malignant progression This new model for prostatic carcinogenesis has implications for the design of new prostate cancer prevention strategies Rational prevention approaches might include i restoration of GSTPI expression via treatment with inhibitors of CpG methylation ii compensation for inadequate GSTPI activity via treatment with inducers of general GST activity and iii abrogation of stresses via avoidance of exogenous carcinogens reduction of endogenous carcinogenic particularly oxidant stresses View details for Web of Science ID 000173778200012 View details for PubMedID 11795433 GSTP1 CpG island DNA hypermethylation in hepatocellular carcinomas INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ONCOLOGY Tchou Lin Freije Isaacs Brooks Rashid De Marzo Kanai Hirohashi Nelson 2000 16 4 Abstract Glutathione enzymes that defend cells against damage mediated by oxidant and electrophilic carcinogens may be critical determinants of cancer pathogenesis We report here that the pathogenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma HCC one of the most common cancers in the world frequently involves an accumulation of somatic DNA methylation changes at GSTP1 the gene encoding the glutathione For our study Hep3B HCC cells and a cohort of 20 HCC tissue specimens were subjected to analysis for GSTP1 expression and for somatic GSTP1 alterations GSTP1 DNA hypermethylation in HCC DNA was assessed by Southern blot analysis via a polymerase chain reaction PCR assay and by using a genomic sequencing approach Hep3B HCC cells failed to express GSTP1 mRNA or GSTP1 polypeptides Similarly HCC cells in 19 of 20 HCC cases were devoid of GSTP1 polypeptides By Southern blot analysis DNA from Hep3B HCC cells displayed abnormal GSTP1 hypermethylation Treatment of Hep3B HCC cells in vitro with the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor both reversed GSTP1 DNA hypermethylation and restored GSTP1 expression Using a PCR assay somatic GSTP1 DNA hypermethylation was also detected in HCC DNA from 17 of 20 HCC cases Genomic sequencing analyses undertaken to map nucleotides located at the GSTP1 transcriptional regulatory region frequently detected somatic DNA hypermethylation near the gene promoter in HCC DNA The data indicate that GSTP1 DNA hypermethylation changes appear frequently in human HCC In addition the data raise the possibility that somatic GSTP1 inactivation via hypermethylation may contribute to the pathogenesis of HCC View

enzyme HinfI No somatically acquired alterations were detected in the mtDNA from any of the five renal oncocytomas One specimen displayed a known HinfI polymorphism in the mtDNA from both the normal

Brooks WEINSTEIN Lin Sun Pin Bova Epstein Isaacs Nelson 1998 7 6 Abstract Prostate intraepithelial neoplasia PIN is a purported prostate cancer precursor lesion and a candidate biomarker for efficacy assessment in prostate cancer chemoprevention trials Loss of expression of the glutathione enzyme GSTP1 which is associated with the hypermethylation of deoxycytidine residues in the CG island region of the GSTP1 gene is a finding in human prostate cancer GSTP1 expression was assessed by immunohistochemistry in 60 PIN samples adjacent to and distant from prostate adenocarcinoma Whereas abundant enzyme polypeptide expression was evident in all normal prostatic tissues all samples of PIN and adenocarcinoma were completely devoid of GSTP1 DNA from 10 PIN lesions was analyzed for GSTP1 CG island methylation changes using a PCR technique targeting a polymorphic ATAAA n repeat sequence in the promoter region of the GSTP1 gene Somatic GSTP1 CG island methylation changes were detected in DNA from 7 of the 10 PIN lesions Allele discrimination was possible for 5 of the 10 DNA samples 2 of the 5 samples exhibited DNA methylation changes at both alleles whereas 3 samples displayed no DNA methylation changes at either allele GSTP1 CG island methylation changes were present in each of the five homozygous samples Hypermethylation of the region of the GSTP1 gene may serve as an important molecular genetic biomarker for both prostate cancer and PIN The finding of frequent GSTP1 methylation changes in PIN and prostate cancer supports a role for PIN lesions as a prostate cancer precursor

from the Visible Human data total of 18 discrete anatomical structures including the prostate bladder urethra rectum and pelvic musculature was segmented from the Visible Human data obtained from the National Library of Medicine Using high speed computing and rendering software models of each structure were generated and assembled into composite reconstructions offer a revised view of pelvic anatomy as it has been traditionally depicted The lateral surfaces of the levator ani muscle are oriented vertically in the pelvis and directly applied to the entire lateral surface of the prostate The bladder rests primarily anterior to the prostate rather than directly above it as has been commonly depicted In the data and reconstructions the trigone and anterior fibromuscular stroma of the prostate appear as a single unit in continuity which may have functional implications for understanding the mechanisms of continence at the bladder neck The striated urethral sphincter appears circular with abundant tissue posteriorly This sphincteric muscle has greater length anteriorly than reconstructions provide unique insights into male pelvic anatomy They are a useful teaching tool

of colonic metaplasia 12 cases of adenocarcinoma of urinary bladder two WDA and one in situ adenocarcinoma from the surgical pathology files of Johns Hopkins Hospital Nine patients with colonic metaplasia had widespread lesions Two showed superficial muscularis propria involvement mimicking adenocarcinoma one of these cases had been diagnosed as infiltrating WDA at both an academic center and a community hospital Dissecting mucin pools were focally seen in four cases of widespread colonic metaplasia also mimicking cancer One of the nine cases showed minimal cytological atypia but no cases showed mitoses or signet ring cells Distinguishing WDA from colonic metaplasia was the finding in WDA of infiltrative architectural pattern two of two extensive muscle invasion two of two moderate anaplasia one of two mitotic figures two of two and extensive mucinous pools one of two The diagnosis of adenocarcinoma in situ was based on anaplasia Clinically colonic metaplasia may resemble cancer Histologically colonic metaplasia may mimic cancer based on extensive involvement of the lamina propria focal mucinous pools focal muscularis propria involvement focal mild cytological

endothelin receptor expressed by normal prostate epithelium ETB is not expressed by any of the established human prostate cancer cell lines and ETB binding is decreased on prostate cancer tissues ETB which may mediate clearance and may inhibit secretion is encoded by a gene that contains a 5 CpG island encompassing the transcriptional regulatory region We examined this regulatory region of the ETB receptor gene EDNRB to determine whether hypermethylation of cytidine nucleotides accompanies decreased ETB expression in human prostate cancer We found somatic methylation of CpG island sequences in EDNRB in 5 of 5 human prostate cancer cell lines 15 of 21 primary prostate cancer tissues and 8 of 14 prostate cancer metastases 70 of samples overall Normal tissues contained only unmethylated EDNRB

Ewing PIANTADOSI Carter Robinson Epstein Isaacs B 1996 56 16 Abstract Inactivation of the p53 gene has been implicated in prostate cancer progression To determine the role of p53 inactivation in the progression of clinical prostatic carcinomas we assessed 67 tumors derived from patients with clinically localized disease for chromosome 17p and p53 gene allelic loss p53 gene mutations using conformational polymorphism and direct sequencing and p53 protein expression using immunohistochemical staining Of 55 informative tumors 10 demonstrated loss of 17p or the p53 gene however only a single tumor had a mutation in its remaining p53 allele Significant p53 overexpression was observed in 2 of 38 tumors and 9 others had faint staining of a few nuclei 1 p53 overexpression occurred in no informative tumor with allelic loss or mutation In a positive immunohistochemical staining did not confer an increased risk of recurrence risk of recurrence P whereas allelic loss of chromosome 17p appeared to be highly correlated with recurrence risk of recurrence P In an unrelated group of 42 patients with metastatic prostate cancer p53 overexpression was found in 26 tumors 62 and 15 36 had high grade staining Neither the presence nor the degree of expression correlated with time to progression or time to death This series suggests that p53 gene inactivation is rare in primary prostatic tumors not essential to the development of prostate cancer metastases and of limited use as a prognostic marker in patients with primary or metastatic disease Another gene or genes on chromosome 17p

1 Abstract Collecting duct carcinoma CDC is a malignant renal neoplasm that is believed to arise from the epithelium of the ducts of Bellini in the distal nephron These tumors are clinically aggressive and more often occur in a younger population than is typical of the more common clear cell renal carcinoma RCC Using highly informative polymorphic microsatellite markers on chromosome arms 3p 5q 6q 9p 9q 11p 13q 17p and 18q we analyzed DNA from nonmalignant and tumor tissue in 6 cases of CDC We found no evidence of 3p loss of heterozygosity LOH in these renal tumors by using multiple markers a finding that distinguishes CDC from RCC in which 3p LOH has frequently been observed We found LOH of 8p in 50 of the tumors examined in addition we observed LOH of 13q in 50 of the tumors studied Interestingly 8p LOH may be associated with high stage and poor clinical prognosis These data suggest that the molecular events responsible for the development of CDC differ from those associated with the origin of RCC and that tumor suppressor genes on 8p and 13q may be involved in the pathogenesis of CDC View details for Web of Science ID A1995QU21600014 View details for PubMedID

alleles from at least one chromosomal arm The short arm of chromosome 8 followed by the long arm of chromosome 16 seem to be the most frequent regions of loss suggesting the presence of novel tumour suppressor genes Deletions of one copy of the RB and TP53 genes are less frequent as are mutations of the TP53 gene and accumulating evidence suggests the presence of an additional tumour suppressor gene on chromosome 17p which is frequently inactivated in prostate cancer Alterations in the catenin mediated adhesion mechanism appear to be present in almost half of all prostate cancers and may be critical to the acquisition of metastatic potential of aggressive prostate cancers Finally altered DNA methylation patterns have been found in the majority of prostate cancers examined suggesting widespread alterations in methylation modulated gene expression The presence of multiple changes in these tumours is consistent with the multistep nature of the transformation process Finally efforts

LOSS IN HUMAN RENAL CANCERS JOURNAL OF UROLOGY Brooks Bova Marshall Isaacs B 1993 150 4 Abstract It is now apparent that multiple genetic alterations including oncogene activation and tumor suppressor gene inactivation are necessary steps in carcinogenesis We have studied this concept in renal cancers by looking at specific tumor suppressor genes implicated in several allelotyping studies Primary predominantly low stage renal tumors of varying grades and histologic subtypes were investigated for allelic loss of 3p 17p and the p53 gene the DCC gene and the Rb gene and its product 3p loss occurred in 47 of tumors studied and was much more common in clear cell cancers 85 17p and p53 gene loss were relatively uncommon events with only 6 of 42 tumors demonstrating loss None of the tumors with typical histologies had allelic loss of the DCC gene though loss did occur in leiomyosarcoma and a collecting duct tumor Allelic loss of the Rb gene occurred in one clear cell tumor the leiomyosarcoma and interestingly in both collecting duct tumors in this series Allelic loss of the Rb gene was correlated with little or no RB protein expression as judged by immunohistochemistry At all loci studied allelic loss did not appear to correlate with tumor grade or stage These results suggest that inactivation of the p53 Rb and DCC genes by allelic loss are uncommon events in the early stages of renal carcinogenesis View details for Web of Science ID A1993LX76200066 View details for PubMedID 8371415 TUBULARIZED NEOURETHRA FOLLOWING RADICAL RETROPUBIC PROSTATECTOMY JOURNAL OF UROLOGY

history at 3 months all men and 6 months 45 of 69 men Continence in the study group was compared to that of 45 men with 6 months of followup who underwent radical retropubic prostatectomy without tubularization of the anterior bladder control group At 3 months 38 of 69 men 55 were continent in the study group and 14 of 45 31 were continent in the control group p At 6 months 39 of 45 men 87 were continent in the study group compared to 21 of 45 47 in the control group p Upright cystograms performed on men with and without the tubularized neourethra after radical retropubic prostatectomy
