Radiology Khalaf Sundaram AbdelRazek Mohammed Shah Khosla Jackson Desai Kothary 2018 180257 Abstract Purpose To develop and validate a predictive model for postembolization syndrome PES following transarterial hepatic chemoembolization TACE for hepatocellular carcinoma Materials and Methods In this retrospective study 370 patients underwent 513 TACE procedures between October 2014 and September 2016 Seventy percent of the patients were randomly assigned to a training data set and the remaining 30 were assigned to a testing data set Variables included demographic laboratory clinical and procedural details PES was defined as pain nausea beyond 6 hours after TACE that required intravenous medication for symptom control The predictive model was developed by using conditional inference trees and Lasso regression Results Demographics laboratory data performance tumor characteristics and procedural details were statistically similar for the training and testing data sets Overall 83 of 370 patients after 107 of 513 TACE procedures met the predefined criteria Factors identified at univariable analysis included large tumor burden P embolic TACE P doxorubicin dose P history of PES P and chronic pain P of which history of PES tumor burden and embolic TACE were identified as the strongest predictors by the multivariable analysis and were used to develop the predictive model When applied to the testing data set the model demonstrated an area under the curve of sensitivity of 79 22 of 28 specificity of 53 of 120 and a negative predictive value of 90 53 of 59 Conclusion The model identified history of postembolization syndrome tumor burden and embolic chemoembolization as predictors of protracted recovery because of postembolization syndrome RSNA 2018

immunodeficiency virus HIV have been implicated in increasing risk of cardiovascular disease However antiretroviral drugs are typically prescribed in combination We characterized the association of current exposure to antiretroviral drug combinations on risk of cardiovascular events including myocardial infarction stroke percutaneous coronary intervention and coronary artery bypass surgery We used the Veterans Health Administration Clinical Case Registry to analyze data from 24 510 patients infected with HIV from January 1996 through December 2009 We assessed the association of current exposure to 15 antiretroviral drugs and 23 prespecified combinations of agents on the risk of cardiovascular event by using marginal structural models and Cox models extended to accommodate variables Over 164 059 of 934 patients had a cardiovascular event Current exposure to abacavir efavirenz lamivudine and zidovudine was significantly associated with increased risk of cardiovascular event with

registry and Medicare claims data 111 patients aged who were admitted to hospital for exacerbation of heart failure or other acute and eligible for primary cause mortality and sudden cardiac death Latency analyses with Cox regression were used to derive crude hazard ratios and hazard ratios adjusted for high dimension propensity score for outcomes after 180 days from index implantation or who received an ICD during a hospital admission had lower crude mortality risk than patients who did not receive an ICD 40 v 60 at three years however with conditioning on 180 day survival and with adjustment for high dimension propensity score the apparent benefit with ICD was no longer evident for sudden cardiac death adjusted hazard ratio 95 confidence interval to and had a diminished impact on total mortality to There were trends towards a benefit with ICD in reducing mortality or sudden cardiac death in patients who had had a myocardial infarction more than 40 days previously left bundle branch block or low serum B type natriuretic peptide however these trends did not reach adjustment for healthy candidate bias and confounding the benefits of primary ICD therapy seen in pivotal trials were not apparent in patients aged 66 or over who received ICDs during a hospital admission for exacerbation of heart failure or other acute Future research is warranted to further identify

Abstract Subgroup analyses are commonly performed in the clinical trial setting with the purpose of illustrating that the treatment effect was consistent across different patient characteristics or identifying characteristics that should be targeted for treatment There are statistical issues involved in performing subgroup analyses however These have been given considerable attention in the literature for analyses where subgroups are defined by a feature Although subgroup analyses are often performed with subgroups defined by a feature including analyses that estimate the treatment effect among compliers discussion of these analyses has been neglected in the clinical literature Such analyses pose a high risk of presenting biased descriptions of treatment effects We summarize the challenges of doing all types of subgroup analyses described in the literature In particular we emphasize issues with subgroup analyses Finally we provide guidelines on how to proceed across the spectrum of subgroup analyses View details for DOI View details for PubMedID 25135344 Association between Latent Proviral Characteristics and Immune Activation in Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type Adults Journal of virology Liang Sceats Bayless Kubo Grant Furman Desai Katzenstein Davis Zolopa Blish A 2014 88 15 Abstract Generalized immune activation during HIV infection is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease neurocognitive disease osteoporosis metabolic disorders and physical frailty The mechanisms driving this immune activation are poorly understood particularly for individuals effectively treated with antiretroviral medications We hypothesized that viral characteristics such as sequence diversity may play a role in driving immune activation We therefore sequenced proviral DNA isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells from individuals on fully suppressive antiretroviral therapy We performed phylogenetic analyses calculated viral diversity and divergence in the env and pol genes and determined coreceptor tropism and the frequency of drug resistance mutations Comprehensive immune profiling included quantification of immune cell subsets plasma cytokine levels and intracellular signaling responses in T cells B cells and monocytes These antiretroviral individuals exhibited a wide range of diversity and divergence in both env and pol genes However proviral diversity and divergence in env and pol coreceptor tropism and the level of drug resistance did not significantly correlate with markers of immune activation A clinical history of virologic failure was also not significantly associated with levels of immune activation indicating that a history of virologic failure does not inexorably lead to increased immune activation as long as suppressive antiretroviral medications are provided Overall this study demonstrates that latent viral diversity is unlikely to be a major driver of persistent immune immune activation which is associated with cardiovascular disease neurologic disease and early aging is likely to be a major driver of morbidity and mortality in individuals Although treatment of HIV with antiretroviral medications decreases the level of immune activation levels do not return to normal The factors driving this persistent immune activation particularly during effective treatment are poorly understood In this study we investigated whether characteristics of the latent integrated HIV provirus that persists during treatment are associated with immune activation We found no relationship between latent viral characteristics and immune activation in treated individuals indicating that qualities of the provirus are unlikely to be a major driver of persistent inflammation We also found that individuals who had previously failed treatment but were currently effectively treated did not have significantly increased levels of immune activation providing hope that past treatment failures do not have a lifelong legacy impact View details for DOI View details for PubMedID 24850730 View details for PubMedCentralID PMC4135944 Addressing Missing Data in Clinical Studies of Kidney Diseases CLINICAL

occupational injury in metal manufacturing BMC PUBLIC HEALTH Kubo Cullen Desai Modrek 2013 13 Abstract Prior research has shown increased risk of injury for female employees compared to male employees after controlling for job and tasks but have not explored whether this increased risk might be moderated by manager gender The gender of one manager could in theory affect injury rates among male and female employees through their managers response to an employee psychosocial stress or through how employees differentially report injuries Other explanations for the gender disparity in injury experience such as ergonomic factors or differential training are unlikely to be impacted by supervisor gender This study seeks to explore whether an employee manager gender modifies the effect of employee gender with regards to risk of acute cohort of employees and managers were identified using human resources and injury management data between January 1 2002 and December 31 2007 for six facilities of a large US aluminum manufacturing company Cox proportional hazards models were employed to examine the interaction between employee gender and whether the employee had female only manager s male only manager s or both male and female managers on injury risk Manager gender category was included as a time varying covariate and reassessed for each employee at the midpoint of each percentage of departments with both female and male managers increased dramatically during the study period due to corporate efforts to increase female representation in management After adjustment for fixed effects at the facility level and shared frailty by department manager gender category does not appear to moderate the effect of employee gender p Manager category was not a significant predictor p of time to first acute injury Similarly having at least one female manager did not modify the hazard of injury for female employees compared to males p and was not a significant predictor of time to first acute injury p findings suggest that female manufacturing employees are at higher risk for acute injury compared to males this analysis suggests that this relationship is not affected

and environmental determinants of human NK cell diversity revealed by mass cytometry Science translational medicine Horowitz Leipold Kubo Dogan Dekker Mackey Maecker Swan Davis Norman Guethlein Desai Parham Blish A 2013 5 208 Abstract Natural killer NK cells play critical roles in immune defense and reproduction yet remain the most poorly understood major lymphocyte population Because their activation is controlled by a variety of combinatorially expressed activating and inhibitory receptors NK cell diversity and function are closely linked To provide an unprecedented understanding of NK cell repertoire diversity we used mass cytometry to simultaneously analyze 37 parameters including 28 NK cell receptors on peripheral blood NK cells from 5 sets of monozygotic twins and 12 unrelated donors of defined human leukocyte antigen HLA and killer cell receptor KIR genotype This analysis revealed a remarkable degree of NK cell diversity with an estimated 6000 to phenotypic populations within an individual and phenotypes in the donor panel Genetics largely determined inhibitory receptor expression whereas activation receptor expression was heavily environmentally influenced Therefore NK cells may maintain through strictly regulated expression of inhibitory receptors while using adaptable expression patterns of activating and costimulatory receptors to respond to pathogens and tumors These findings further suggest the possibility that discrete NK cell subpopulations could be harnessed for immunotherapeutic strategies in the settings of infection reproduction

postmenopausal women over time Medicine and science in sports and exercise Sims Kubo Desai Bea Beasley Manson Allison Seguin Chen Michael Sullivan Beresford Stefanick 2013 45 8 Abstract PURPOSE Higher physical activity PA has been associated with greater attenuation of gain and preservation of lean mass across the lifespan These analyses aimed to determine relationships of change in PA to changes in fat and lean body mass in a longitudinal prospective study of postmenopausal women METHODS Among women enrolled at three Women Health Initiative WHI clinical centers were selected to undergo absorptiometry DXA had baseline body composition measurements with at least one repeated measure at yr 1 3 and 6 PA data were obtained by at baseline 3 and 6 yr of PA impact on change in lean and fat mass during the study period for age groups 79y was estimated using mixed effects linear regression RESULTS Baseline PA and body composition differed significantly among the three age groups The association of change in fat mass from baseline and PA differed across the three age groups In women aged gain in fat mass from baseline was attenuated with higher levels of physical activity Women aged lost fat mass at all PA levels In contrast change in lean mass from baseline and PA did not differ by age group CONCLUSIONS The association between PA and change in fat mass varies by age group with younger but not older women benefitting from higher levels of aerobic Higher levels of aerobic activity are not associated with changes in lean mass which tends to decrease in older women regardless of activity level Greater attention to resistance training exercises may be needed to prevent lean mass loss as women age View details for DOI View details for PubMedID 23439422 Piecewise exponential models to assess the influence of experience on the hazard of acute injury for hourly factory workers BMC MEDICAL RESEARCH METHODOLOGY Kubo Cullen Cantley Slade Taiwo Desai 2013 13 Abstract An inverse relationship between experience and risk of injury has been observed in many occupations Due to statistical challenges however it has been difficult to characterize the role of experience on the hazard of injury In particular because the time observed up to injury is equivalent to the amount of experience accumulated the baseline hazard of injury becomes the main parameter of interest excluding Cox proportional hazards models as applicable methods for a data set of hourly production workers of a global aluminum company at 207 US facilities we compared competing parametric models for the baseline hazard to assess whether experience affected the hazard of injury at hire and after later job changes Specific models considered included the exponential Weibull and two a and a exponential models to formally test the null hypothesis that experience does not impact the hazard of highlighted the advantages of our comparative approach and the interpretability of our selected model a exponential model that allowed the baseline hazard of injury to change with experience Our findings suggested a 30 increase in the hazard in the first year after job initiation exponential models may be particularly useful in modeling risk of injury as a function of experience and have the additional benefit of interpretability over other similarly flexible models View

the presence of clustering when cluster membership is unclear as may commonly occur in clustered randomized trials For example in such trials cluster membership may not be recorded for one or more treatment arms cluster membership may be dynamic When clusters are well defined REs have properties that are robust to misspecification of the correlation structure To examine whether results were sensitive to assumptions about the clustering membership we conducted simulation studies for a clinical trial where the number of clusters the intracluster correlation ICC and the sample size varied REs of standard errors that incorrectly assumed clustering of data that were truly independent yielded type I error rates of up to 40 Partial and complete misspecifications of membership where some and no knowledge of true membership were incorporated into assumptions for data generated from a large number of clusters 50 with a moderate ICC yielded type I error rates that ranged from to and to

organ retrieval is challenging Newer radiologic imaging techniques allow for better determination of total kidney and cortical volume measurements reconstructed from magnetic resonance or computed tomography imaging from living donor candidates we characterized total kidney and cortical volumes according to sex age weight height body mass index BMI and body surface area BSA mean cortical volume was 204 mL range mL with no significant differences between left and right cortical volumes The degree to which existing anthropomorphic surrogates predict nephron mass was quantified and a diligent attempt was made to derive a better surrogate model for nephron mass Cortical volumes were strongly associated with sex and BSA but not with weight height or BMI Four prediction models for cortical volume constructed using combinations of age sex race weight and height were compared with models including either BSA or existing surrogate measures BSA was superior to BMI in predicting renal

health care costs We analyzed data from a subset of 1426 HEMO study subjects to determine whether more frequent intradialytic hypotension lower predialysis systolic BP were associated with higher rates of vascular access thrombosis Our primary outcome measure was episodes of vascular access thrombosis occurring within a given period during HEMO study There were 2005 total episodes of vascular access thrombosis during a median years of The relative rate of thrombosis of native arteriovenous fistulas for the highest quartile of intradialytic hypotension was approximately twice that of the lowest quartile independent of predialysis systolic BP and other covariates There was no significant association of intradialytic hypotension with prosthetic arteriovenous graft thrombosis after multivariable adjustment Higher predialysis systolic BP was associated with a lower rate of fistula and graft thrombosis independent of intradialytic hypotension and other covariates In conclusion more frequent episodes of intradialytic hypotension and lower predialysis systolic BP associate with increased rates of vascular access thrombosis These results underscore the importance of including

from 10 to have been found at high frequencies in many natural and experimental populations Mutators are continually produced from nonmutators often due to mutations in genes These mutators gradually accumulate deleterious mutations limiting their spread However they can occasionally hitchhike to high frequencies with beneficial mutations We study the interplay between these effects We first analyze the dynamics of the balance between the production of mutator alleles and their elimination due to deleterious mutations We find that when deleterious mutation rates are high in mutators there will often be many young recently produced mutators in the population and the fact that deleterious mutations only gradually eliminate individuals from a population is important We then consider how this balance can be disrupted by beneficial mutations and analyze the circumstances in which fixation of mutator alleles is likely We find that dynamics is crucial even in situations where selection on average acts against mutators so they can not stably invade the mutators can still occasionally generate beneficial mutations and hence be important to the evolution of the population View details

INTERNATIONAL Lee Ritch Desai Benson McKiernan 2011 107 11 Abstract Therapy case series examine the interaction of body mass index BMI and race in predicting biochemical failure BCF after radical prostatectomy RP The relative contribution of BMI and race to BCF after RP has not been well 1988 to 2008 969 white and black men underwent RP and BMI data were available In all 168 were black and 801 were white men BCF was defined as a PSA on measurements Cox regression methods were used to model the relationship between race BMI and 969 men had a mean age of years There was no significant difference in BMI between black and white men The survival for black obese men was the lowest at 48 compared with black 73 obese white 82 and white men 83 P BMI did not have a significant impact on BCF In a multivariate analysis black race remained an independent predictor of BCF hazard ratio HR BMI does not affect the risk of BCF in black men differently than white men P value for interaction race is an independent predictor of biochemical failure after adjusting for pathological factors The impact of BMI on BCF did not vary among different races These findings suggest that elevated BMI does not affect the BCF rates of black men more than in other races and that other factors may influence the racial variability in survival and BCF risk View details for DOI View details for Web of

Chang Desai Solomon Winkelmayer 2011 6 4 Abstract The association of kidney function with outpatient medication adherence in the elderly remains cohort of 2103 patients over the age of 65 years enrolled in a pharmacy benefits program after hospital discharge for myocardial infarction was studied Using linear mixed effects models the association of baseline kidney function with adherence to recommended medications after myocardial infarction was examined including angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors ACEIs and angiotensin II receptor blockers ARBs and statins The primary outcome measure was the percentage of days covered as calculated by pharmacy refill data for 12 serial intervals totaling 36 months of adherence to and statins was poor The mean percentage of days covered by 36 months was only 50 to 60 for all three medication classes Patients with baseline kidney dysfunction had significantly lower and adherence compared with patients with higher baseline kidney function statin adherence did not vary by baseline level of kidney medication adherence after myocardial infarction in the elderly is low especially in patients with kidney dysfunction Future strategies to improve medication adherence should pay special attention to the elderly with kidney dysfunction because they may be especially vulnerable to its adverse clinical consequences View details for DOI

patients in the HEMO study JOURNAL OF HUMAN HYPERTENSION Chang Friedman Cheung Greene Desai Chertow 2011 25 2 Abstract Previous studies of blood pressure and mortality in haemodialysis have yielded mixed results perhaps due to confounding by comorbid conditions We hypothesized that after improved accounting for confounding factors higher systolic blood pressure SBP would be associated with higher mortality We conducted a secondary analysis of data from the haemodialysis study a randomized trial in prevalent haemodialysis patients We used three proportional hazard models to determine the relative hazard at different levels of SBP 1 used baseline SBP 2 used SBP as a variable and 3 added a lag to to changes in SBP associated with acute illness In all the models SBP 120 mm Hg was associated with a higher risk of mortality compared with the referent group mm Hg higher SBP was not associated with higher risk of mortality In conclusion we observed a robust association between lower SBP and higher risk for and cardiovascular mortality in a cohort of prevalent haemodialysis patients Randomized clinical trials are needed to define optimal blood pressure targets in the

pathogenic regulators instructed by vessel wall dendritic cells to differentiate into vasculitic T cells The unique pathways driving this dendritic interaction are incompletely understood but may provide novel therapeutic targets for a disease in which the only established therapy is treatment with high doses of and gene expression analyses of giant cell temporal arteries revealed abundant expression of the NOTCH receptor and its ligands Jagged1 and Delta1 Cleavage of the NOTCH intracellular domain in T cells indicated ongoing NOTCH pathway activation in vasculitis NOTCH activation did not occur in vasculitis affecting branches of the vasa vasorum tree We devised 2 strategies to block NOTCH pathway activation inhibitor treatment preventing nuclear translocation of the NOTCH intracellular domain and competing for interactions through excess soluble ligand In a humanized mouse model NOTCH pathway disruption had strong immunosuppressive effects inhibiting activation in the early and established phases of vascular inflammation NOTCH inhibition was particularly effective in downregulating Th17 responses but also markedly suppressed Th1 NOTCH signaling depleted T cells from the vascular infiltrates implicating NOTCH ligand interactions in regulating retention and survival in vessel wall inflammation Modulating the NOTCH signaling cascade emerges as a promising new

molecular epidemiology studies biospecimen data are collected often with the purpose of evaluating the synergistic role between a biomarker and another feature on an outcome Typically biomarker data are collected on only a proportion of subjects eligible for study leading to a missing data problem Missing data methods however are not customarily incorporated into analyses Instead CC analyses are performed which can result in biased and inefficient simulations we characterized the performance of CC methods when interaction effects are estimated We also investigated whether standard multiple imputation MI could improve estimation over CC methods when the data are not missing at random NMAR and auxiliary information may or may not analyses were shown to result in considerable bias and efficiency loss While MI reduced bias and increased efficiency over CC methods under specific conditions it too resulted in biased estimates depending on the strength of the auxiliary data available and the nature of the missingness In particular CC performed better than MI when extreme values of the covariate were more likely to be missing while MI outperformed CC when missingness of the covariate related to both the covariate and outcome MI always improved performance when strong auxiliary data were available In a real study MI estimates of interaction effects were attenuated relative to those from a CC findings suggest the importance of incorporating missing data methods into the analysis If the data are MAR standard MI is a reasonable method Auxiliary variables may make this assumption more reasonable even if the data are NMAR Under NMAR we emphasize caution when using standard MI and recommend it over CC only when strong auxiliary data are available MI with the missing data mechanism specified is an alternative when the data are NMAR In all cases it is recommended to take advantage of MI ability to account for the uncertainty of these assumptions View

women are postponing first pregnancy to older ages therefore many young patients are seeking clinical guidance regarding the safety of conception and treatment options that may not prevent subsequent pregnancy Newly developed chemotherapy protocols of brief duration have improved life expectancy enabling some women to consider childbearing This study was conducted to compare prognosis among breast cancer patients with and without a subsequent pregnancy Medical record review of female members of a Northern California prepaid health care plan enabled the identification of 107 women with one or more subsequent pregnancies and 344 cases without a pregnancy who were diagnosed between 1968 and 1995 Sets were matched on age year and stage at diagnosis months of survival and recurrence status at conception Among the matched sets neither risk of recurrence nor death differed significantly by subsequent pregnancy history during an average 12 years of adjusted hazard ratio HR recurrence adjusted HR death Women interested in preserving their fertility and considering pregnancy are a population therefore to reduce potential bias cases were matched on recurrence status at time of conception Although the number of cases was limited subgroup analyzes indicated a small nonsignificant adverse effect among women who conceived within 12 months of diagnosis This analysis of carefully matched

The role of vitamin D and SLCO1B1 5 gene polymorphism in myalgias Linde Peng Desai Feldman 2010 2 2 Abstract Myalgias are the most common side effect of statin use and the commonest cause for

SLCO1B1 5 gene polymorphism decreasing function in the gene coding for a liver anion transporter that is responsible for statin uptake has been found to explain the majority of muscle symptoms Patients with myalgias have been reported to improve with vitamin D supplementation We therefore investigated i whether repletion of vitamin D in deficient patients with myalgias could lead to tolerance for subsequent statin therapy and ii whether vitamin D status modifies the effect of the SLCO1B1 5 genotype on myalgia risk Using a retrospective cohort of 64 patients in whom D 25 OH D had been measured for any reason while on statin therapy including 46 patients who consented to be genotyped we found strong evidence showing that repletion of vitamin D in vitamin D deficient patients improved myalgias Of 21 vitamin D deficient patients with intolerable myalgias 14 of 15 rechallenged with statins were subsequently symptomfree with one patient experiencing mild and tolerable symptoms far exceeding expected rates of acquired tolerability with no therapy p In addition while the SLCO1B1 5 genotype was associated with a increased risk of myalgias p this risk was not found to

H460 lung cancer cell line is markedly resistant to the growth inhibitory effects of Poly E compared with SW480 colon and esophageal cancer cells We investigated the mechanism of H460 resistance by comparing gene expression profiles of Poly and cells Unsupervised hierarchical clustering revealed that Poly cells clustered separately from Poly cells and genes were differentially expressed between the two groups at the level of significance We discovered that BCL2 gene and protein expression were significantly higher in H460 cells compared with SW480 and cells higher gene expression P Inhibition of BCL2 expression and activity using siRNA and the small molecule inhibitor respectively restored sensitivity to Poly E and induced apoptosis by decreasing mitochondrial membrane potential and inducing PARP cleavage Our results suggest that increased BCL2 expression may contribute to H460 resistance to the growth inhibitory effects of Poly If validated in additional laboratory and

resistance in brain tumors is partially mediated by the barrier of which a key component is which is highly expressed in cerebral capillaries Tamoxifen is a nontoxic inhibitor of This trial assessed in primary and metastatic brain tumors the differential deposition of paclitaxel and whether tamoxifen could increase paclitaxel for surgical resection of their primary or metastatic brain tumors were prospectively randomized to prior paclitaxel alone 175 2 or tamoxifen for 5 days followed by paclitaxel Central and peripheral tumor surrounding normal brain and plasma were analyzed for paclitaxel and patients completed the study Based on a multivariate linear regression model no significant differences in paclitaxel concentrations between the two study arms were found after adjusting for treatment group tamoxifen versus control However in analysis for tumor type metastatic brain tumors had higher paclitaxel concentrations in the tumor center P and in the tumor periphery P compared with primary brain tumors Pharmacokinetic analyses showed comparable paclitaxel areas under the serum concentration between treatment deposition was not increased with this tamoxifen schedule as the low plasma concentrations were likely secondary to concurrent use of medications However the statistically higher paclitaxel deposition in the periphery of metastatic brain tumors provides functional evidence corroborating reports of decreased expression in metastatic versus primary brain tumors This suggests that metastatic brain tumors may respond to paclitaxel if it has proven clinical efficacy

was lower in cases compared with controls among sisters discordant for breast cancer from the Metropolitan New York Registry of Breast Cancer Families We have now determined genotypes for seven single nucleotide polymorphisms in five nucleotide excision repair genes including Xeroderma pigmentosum complementation group A XPA C group C XPC Lys939Gln and Ala499Val group D XPD Asp312Asn and Lys751Gln and group G XPG His1104Asp and ERCC1 8092 C A in a total of 160 sister pairs for whom DRC phenotype data were available Overall there were no statistically significant differences in average DRC for most of the genotypes A final multivariate conditional logistic model including three single nucleotide polymorphisms XPA C XPC Ala499Val and XPG His1104Asp and smoking status only modestly predicted DRC after adjusting for status and age of blood donation The overall predictive accuracy was 61 in the model with a sensitivity of 78 and specificity of 39 These findings suggest that those

determine which if any chromosome arms harbor tumor suppressor propose a large class of mixture models for describing the data and we suggest using Bayes factors to select a reasonable model from the class in order to classify the chromosome arms Bayes factors are especially useful in the case of testing that the number of components in a mixture model is n0 versus n1 In these cases frequentist test statistics based on the likelihood ratio statistic have unknown distributions and are therefore not applicable Our simulation study shows that Bayes factors favor the right model most of the time when tumor suppressor genes are present When no tumor suppressor genes are present and background varies the Bayes factors are often inconclusive although this results in a markedly reduced rate

randomized Phase II design for the purpose of selecting a treatment for eventual Phase III testing has recently gained popularity in cancer clinical research Unfortunately along with its wider use also come frequent misapplications The major misuse of the design is the treatment of the Phase II results as ends in themselves without further definitive evaluation For binary and censored exponential survival data we quantify the chance of observing impressive differences when underlying distributions are exactly the same in and selection designs Depending on one view of what is impressive the rates range from 20 to over 40 We stress that randomized Phase II results are pilots to Phase III evaluations One should not regard them as conclusive We caution especially against the inclusion of control arms in such designs because of the propensity for erroneous inferences We also discuss the inappropriate practice of performing hypothesis testing and presenting that are less
