Kueppers Lichstein Ogle Poulter Pugh Seidl Turner Uriarte Walker Xu 2020 368 6494 Abstract Forest dynamics arise from the interplay of environmental drivers and disturbances with the demographic processes of recruitment growth and mortality subsequently driving biomass and species composition However forest disturbances and subsequent recovery are shifting with global changes in climate and land use altering these dynamics Changes in environmental drivers land use and disturbance regimes are forcing forests toward younger shorter stands Rising carbon dioxide acclimation adaptation and migration can influence these impacts Recent developments in Earth system models support increasingly realistic simulations of vegetation dynamics In parallel emerging remote sensing datasets promise qualitatively new and more abundant data on the underlying processes and consequences for vegetation structure When combined these advances hold promise for improving the scientific understanding of

Scharenbroch Jumpponen Anderegg Randerson Jackson B 2018 553 7687 Abstract Fire frequency is changing globally and is projected to affect the global carbon cycle and climate However uncertainty about how ecosystems respond to decadal changes in fire frequency makes it difficult to predict the effects of altered fire regimes on the carbon cycle for instance we do not fully understand the effects of fire on soil carbon and nutrient storage or whether nutrient losses limit plant productivity Here we analyse data from 48 sites in savanna grasslands broadleaf forests and needleleaf forests spanning up to 65 years during which time the frequency of fires was altered at each site We find that frequently burned plots experienced a decline in surface soil carbon and nitrogen that was through time having 36 per cent per cent less carbon and 38 per cent per cent less nitrogen after 64 years than plots that were protected from fire carbon and nitrogen losses were substantial in savanna grasslands and broadleaf forests but not in temperate and boreal needleleaf forests We also observe comparable soil carbon and nitrogen losses in an independent field dataset and in dynamic model simulations of global vegetation The model study predicts that the losses of soil nitrogen that result from more frequent burning may in turn decrease the carbon that is sequestered by net primary productivity by about 20 per cent of the total carbon that is emitted from burning biomass over the same period Furthermore we estimate that the effects of changes in fire frequency on ecosystem carbon storage may be 30 per cent too low if they do not include multidecadal changes in soil carbon especially in drier savanna grasslands Future changes in fire frequency may shift ecosystem carbon storage by changing soil carbon pools and nitrogen limitations on plant growth altering the carbon sink capacity of frequently burning savanna grasslands and broadleaf forests View details for PubMedID 29227988 The

difficult to predict and is subject to multiple environmental and land management factors Gains losses and no significant changes have all been reported Here we compile chronosequence data from published studies and new field sites to assess the response of SOC to agricultural land abandonment in peninsular Spain We found an overall SOC accumulation rate of SOC dynamics are highly variable

gains after three decades Our secondary forest field sites accrued C following abandonment and displayed greater SOC and N depth heterogeneity than natural forests demonstrating the impact of

Peters Selker Tetzlaff Zalewski Scanlon 2020 Abstract Irrigated agriculture contributes 40 of total global food production In the US High Plains which produces more than 50 million tons per year of grain as much as 90 of irrigation originates from groundwater resources including the Ogallala aquifer In parts of the High Plains groundwater resources are being depleted so rapidly that they are considered nonrenewable compromising food security When groundwater becomes scarce groundwater withdrawals peak causing a subsequent peak in crop production Previous descriptions of finite natural resource depletion have utilized the Hubbert curve By coupling the dynamics of groundwater pumping recharge and crop production curves emerge responding to the linked variations in groundwater pumping and grain production On a state level this approach predicted when groundwater withdrawal and grain production peaked and the lag between them The lags increased with the adoption of efficient irrigation practices and higher recharge rates Results indicate that in Texas withdrawals peaked in 1966 followed by a peak in grain production 9 y later After better irrigation technologies were adopted the lag increased to 15 y from 1997 to 2012 In Kansas where these technologies were employed concurrently with the rise of irrigated grain production this lag was predicted to be 24 y starting in 1994 In Nebraska grain production is projected to continue rising through 2050 because of high recharge rates While Texas and Nebraska had equal irrigated output in 1975 by 2050 it is projected that Nebraska will have almost 10 times the production of Texas View details for DOI View details for PubMedID 33020284 Homogenization of the terrestrial water cycle NATURE GEOSCIENCE Levia Creed

Hugelius Loisel Chadburn Jackson Jones MacDonald Marushchak Olefeldt Packalen Siewert Treat Turetsky Voigt Yu Z 2020 Abstract Northern peatlands have accumulated large stocks of organic carbon C and nitrogen N but their spatial distribution and vulnerability to climate warming remain uncertain Here we used techniques with extensive peat core data n to create maps of northern peatland C and N stocks and to assess their response to warming and permafrost thaw We estimate that northern peatlands cover million km2 and store 415 150 Pg C and 10 7 Pg Nearly half of the peatland area and peat C stocks are permafrost affected Using modeled global warming stabilization scenarios from to 6 warming we project that the current sink of atmospheric C Pg in northern peatlands will shift to a C source as to million km2 of peatlands thaw The projected thaw would cause peatland greenhouse gas emissions equal to 1 of anthropogenic radiative forcing in this century The main forcing is from methane emissions to 3 Pg cumulative with smaller carbon dioxide forcing 1 to 2 Pg and minor nitrous oxide losses We project that initial losses reverse after 200 y as warming strengthens peatland We project substantial but highly uncertain additional losses of peat into fluvial systems of 10 to 30 Pg C and to Pg The combined gaseous and fluvial peatland C loss estimated here adds 30 to 50 onto previous estimates of C losses with southern permafrost regions being the most vulnerable View details for DOI View details for PubMedID 32778585 The Global Methane Budget EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA

importance of greenhouse gas inventories can not be overstated the process of producing inventories informs strategies that governments will use to meet emissions reduction targets The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change IPCC leads an effort to develop and refine internationally agreed upon methodologies for calculating and reporting greenhouse gas emissions and removals We argue that these guidelines are not equipped to handle the task of developing national greenhouse gas inventories for most countries Inventory guidelines are vital to implementing climate action and we highlight opportunities to improve their timeliness and accuracy Such reforms should provide the means to better understand and advance the progress countries are making toward their Paris commitments Now is the time to consider challenges posed by the current process to develop the guidelines and to avail the policy community of recent major advances in quantitative and expert

technology Lebel Lu Vielstädte Kang Banner Fischer Jackson B 2020 Abstract California hosts abandoned and plugged AP oil and gas wells idle wells and active wells whose methane CH4 emissions remain largely unquantified at levels below kg CH4 We sampled 121 wells using two methods a rapid mobile plume integration method detection g CH4 and a more sensitive static flux chamber detection g CH4 We measured small but detectable methane emissions from 34 of 97 AP wells mean emission g CH4 In contrast we found emissions from 11 of 17 idle are not currently producing mean g CH4 of 6 active wells mean g CH4 and one unplugged open casing with no infrastructure present g CH4 Our results support previous findings that emissions from plugged wells are low but are more substantial from idle wells In addition our smaller sample of active wells suggests that their reported emissions are consistent with previous studies and deserve further attention Due to limited access we could not measure wells in most major active oil and gas fields in California therefore we recommend additional data collection from all types of wells but especially active and idle wells View details for DOI View

SIC represent more than a quarter of the terrestrial carbon pool and are often considered to be relatively stable with fluxes significant only on geologic timescales However given the importance of climatic water balance on SIC accumulation we tested the hypothesis that increased soil water storage and transport resulting from cultivation may enhance dissolution of SIC altering their local stock at decadal time scales We compared SIC storage to m depth in eight sites each having paired plots of native vegetation and croplands and half the sites having additional irrigated cropland plots and irrigated croplands had 328 and 730 Mg less SIC storage respectively compared to their native vegetation grassland or woodland pairs and irrigated croplands had 402 Mg less than their pairs P SIC contents were negatively correlated with estimated groundwater recharge suggesting that dissolution and leaching may be responsible for SIC losses observed Under croplands the remaining SIC had more modern radiocarbon and a δ13 C composition that was closer to crop inputs than under native vegetation suggesting that cultivation has led to faster turnover and incorporation of recent crop carbon into the SIC pool P The losses occurred just years after changes indicating SIC stocks that were stable for millennia can rapidly adjust to increased soil water flows Large SIC losses Mg also occurred below m deep under irrigated croplands with SIC losses lagging behind the wetting front by years suggesting that even deep SIC were affected These observations suggest that the vertical distribution of SIC in dry ecosystems is dynamic on decadal timescales highlighting its potential role as a carbon sink or source to be examined in the context of land use and climate change View details for DOI

Abstract Nitrous oxide N2O like carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas that accumulates in the atmosphere Over the past 150 years increasing atmospheric N2O concentrations have contributed to stratospheric ozone depletion1 and climate change2 with the current rate of increase estimated at 2 per cent per decade Existing national inventories do not provide a full picture of N2O emissions owing to their omission of natural sources and limitations in methodology for attributing anthropogenic sources Here we present a global N2O inventory that incorporates both natural and anthropogenic sources and accounts for the interaction between nitrogen additions and the biochemical processes that control N2O emissions We use inventory statistical extrapolation of flux measurements land and ocean modelling and atmospheric inversion approaches to provide a comprehensive quantification of global N2O sources and sinks resulting from 21 natural and human sectors between 1980 and 2016 Global N2O emissions were estimates teragrams of nitrogen per year and teragrams of nitrogen per year between 2007 and 2016 Global emissions which are dominated by nitrogen additions to croplands increased by 30 over the past four decades to teragrams of nitrogen per year This increase was mainly responsible for the growth in the atmospheric burden Our findings point to growing N2O emissions in emerging Brazil China and India Analysis of model estimates reveals an emerging feedback resulting from interactions between nitrogen additions and climate change The recent growth in N2O emissions exceeds some of the highest projected emission underscoring the urgency to mitigate N2O emissions View details for DOI View details for PubMedID 33028999 Carbon dioxide emissions continue to grow amidst

enrichment usually increases aboveground productivity ANPP of grassland vegetation but the magnitude of the response differs among ecosystems Soil properties affect ANPP via multiple mechanisms and vary over topographic to geographic gradients but have received little attention as potential modifiers of the response We assessed effects of three soil types sandy loam silty clay and clay on the ANPP response of perennial C3 grassland communities to a subambient to elevated CO2 gradient over 10 years in Texas USA We predicted an interactive rather than additive effect of CO2 and soil type on ANPP Contrary to prediction CO2 and soil additively influenced grassland ANPP Increasing CO2 by 250 muL increased ANPP by 170 g across soil types Increased clay content from 10 to 50 among soils reduced ANPP by 50 g CO2 enrichment increased ANPP via a predominant direct effect accompanied by a smaller indirect effect mediated by successional shift to increased dominance of the C4 tallgrass Sorghastrum nutans Our results indicate a large positive influence of CO2 enrichment on grassland productivity that resulted from direct physiological benefits of CO2 augmented by species succession

Porporato A 2018 Abstract As climate change continues forest vulnerability to droughts and heatwaves is increasing but vulnerability varies regionally and locally through landscape position Also most models used in forecasting forest responses to heat and drought do not incorporate relevant spatial processes In order to improve spatial predictions of tree vulnerability we employed a nonlinear stochastic model of soil moisture dynamics accounting for landscape differences in aspect topography and soils Across a watershed in central Texas we modeled dynamic water stress for a dominant tree species Juniperus ashei and projected future dynamic water stress through the 21st century Modeled dynamic water stress tracked spatial patterns of remotely sensed canopy loss Accuracy in predicting stands increased from 60 accounting for spatially variable soil conditions to 72 when also including lateral redistribution of water and effects attributable to aspect Our analysis also suggests that dynamic water stress will increase through the 21st century with trees persisting at only selected microsites Favorable may exist across a landscape where trees can persist however if future droughts are too severe the buffering capacity of an heterogeneous landscape could be overwhelmed Incorporating spatial data will improve projections of future tree water stress and identification of potential

BIOLOGY Fay Aspinwall Collins Gibson Gill Jackson Jin Khasanova Reichmann Polley 2018 24 4 Abstract Continuing enrichment of atmospheric CO2 may change plant community composition in part by altering the availability of other limiting resources including soil water nutrients or light The combined effects of CO2 enrichment and altered resource availability on species flowering remain poorly understood We quantified flowering culm and ramet production and biomass allocation to flowering for 10 years in C4 grassland communities on contrasting soils along a CO2 concentration gradient spanning to expected century levels CO2 enrichment explained up to 77 of the variation in flowering culm count across soils for three of the five species and was correlated with flowering culm count on at least one soil for four of five species In contrast allocation to flowering culms was only weakly correlated with CO2 enrichment for two species Flowering culm counts were strongly correlated with species aboveground biomass AGB R2 a measure of species abundance CO2 enrichment also increased soil moisture and decreased light levels within the canopy but did not affect soil inorganic nitrogen availability Structural equation models fit across the soils suggested controls on flowering in two general forms 1 CO2 effects on flowering culm count mediated by canopy light level and

drought in recorded history This event provided a unique natural experiment to assess responses to extreme drought and mortality of four woody species Quercus fusiformis Diospyros texana Prosopis glandulosa and Juniperus ashei We examined hypothesized mechanisms that could promote these species diverse mortality patterns using postdrought measurements on surviving trees coupled to retrospective process modelling The species exhibited a wide range of gas exchange responses hydraulic strategies and mortality rates Multiple proposed indices of mortality mechanisms were inconsistent with the observed mortality patterns across species including measures of the degree of photosynthesis carbohydrate depletion and hydraulic safety margins Large losses of spring and summer conductance driven by belowground losses of conductance and shallower rooting depths were associated with species that exhibited greater mortality Based on this retrospective analysis we suggest that species more vulnerable to drought were more likely to have succumbed to hydraulic failure belowground View details for PubMedID 29314069 Structural and Hydrogeological Controls on Hydrocarbon and Brine Migration into Drinking Water Aquifers in Southern New York GROUNDWATER Kreuzer Darrah Grove Moore Warner Eymold Whyte Mitra Jackson Vengosh Poreda J 2018 56 2 Abstract Environmental concerns regarding the potential for drinking water contamination in shallow aquifers have accompanied unconventional energy development in the northern Appalachian Basin These activities have also raised several critical questions about the hydrogeological parameters that control the naturally occurring presence and migration of hydrocarbon gases in shallow aquifers within petroliferous basins To interrogate these factors we analyzed the noble gas dissolved ion and hydrocarbon gas molecular and isotopic composition geochemistry of 98 groundwater samples from New York All samples were collected from unconventional drilling activities and sample locations were intentionally targeted based on their proximity to various types of documented fault systems In agreement with studies from other petroliferous basins our results show significant correlations between elevated levels of radiogenic 4 He thermogenic CH4 and dissolved ions Cl Br Sr Ba In combination our data suggest that faults have facilitated the transport of exogenous brines from Devonian source rocks into overlying Upper Devonian aquifer lithologies over geologic time These data conflict with previous reports which conclude that hydrodynamic focusing regulates the occurrence of methane and salt in shallow aquifers and leads to elevated levels of these species in restricted flow zones within valley bottoms Instead our data suggest that faults in Paleozoic rocks play a fundamental role in gas and brine transport from depth regulate the distribution of their occurrence in shallow aquifers and influence the geochemistry of shallow groundwater in this petroliferous basin View details for PubMedID 29409144 The need to protect fresh and brackish groundwater resources during unconventional oil

2018 24 2 Abstract Soil organic matter SOM supports the Earth ability to sustain terrestrial ecosystems provide food and fiber and retains the largest pool of actively cycling carbon Over 75 of the soil organic carbon SOC in the top meter of soil is directly affected by human land use Large land areas have lost SOC as a result of land use practices yet there are compensatory opportunities to enhance productivity and SOC storage in degraded lands through improved management practices Large areas with and without intentional management are also being subjected to rapid changes in climate making many SOC stocks vulnerable to losses by decomposition or disturbance In order to quantify potential SOC losses or sequestration at field regional and global scales measurements for detecting changes in SOC are needed Such measurements and best practices should be based on well established and emerging scientific understanding of processes of C stabilization and destabilization over various timescales soil types and spatial scales As newly engaged members of the International Soil Carbon Network we have identified gaps in data modeling and communication that underscore the need

Governance along Electricity Supply Chains with Life Cycle Assessment The Energy Exchange Environmental science technology Bolorinos Ajami Muñoz Meléndez Jackson B 2018 Abstract This paper presents a life cycle assessment of a electricity supply chain that links the impact of each unit process to its governing policy framework An assessment method is developed and applied to the energy exchange as a unique case study emissions impacts water withdrawals and air quality impacts associated with California imports of electricity from Mexican facilities fueled by natural gas from the Southwest are estimated and and Mexican state and federal environmental regulations are examined to assess consistency of energy policies Results indicate most of the water withdrawn per kWh exported to California occurs in Baja California most of the air quality impacts accrue in the Southwest and emissions of are more evenly divided between the two regions California energy policy design addresses CO2 emissions but not upstream emissions of methane during the fuel cycle Water and air quality impacts are not regulated consistently due to varying state policies and a lack of stringent federal regulation of unconventional gas development Considering local impacts and the regulatory context where they occur provides essential qualitative information for measures of life cycle impact and is

from extreme drought a trend that is expected to increase with climate change Loss of trees has significant ecological biophysical and biogeochemical consequences In 2011 a record drought caused widespread tree mortality in Texas Using remotely sensed imagery we quantified canopy loss during and after the drought across the state at spatial resolution from the eastern forests to the western shrublands a region that includes the boundaries of many species ranges Canopy loss observations in multitemporal orthophotos were used to train coarser Landsat imagery to create binary statewide canopy loss maps We found that canopy loss occurred across all major ecoregions of Texas with an average loss of The drought had the highest impact in post oak woodlands shrublands and Ashe juniper woodlands Focusing on a by transect spanning the State fivefold precipitation gradient to mm we compared spatially explicit 2011 climatic anomalies to our canopy loss maps Much of the canopy loss occurred in areas that passed specific climatic thresholds warm season anomalies in mean temperature and vapor pressure deficit VPD kPa annual percent deviation in precipitation and 2011 difference

forest that depends on convection to sustain gross primary productivity and growth Earth system models that estimate future climate and vegetation show little agreement in Amazon simulations Here we show that biases in internally generated climate primarily precipitation explain most of the uncertainty in Earth system model results models empirical data and theory converge when precipitation biases are accounted for Gross primary productivity biomass and tree cover align on a hydrological relationship with a breakpoint at mm annual precipitation where the system transitions between water and radiation limitation of evapotranspiration The breakpoint appears to be fairly stable in the future suggesting resilience of the Amazon to climate change Changes in precipitation and land use are therefore more likely to govern biomass and vegetation structure in system model simulations of future climate in the Amazon show little agreement Here the authors show that biases in internally

Plant rooting depth affects ecosystem resilience to environmental stress such as drought Deep roots connect deep to the atmosphere thus influencing the hydrologic cycle and climate Deep roots enhance bedrock weathering thus regulating the carbon cycle However we know little about how deep roots go and why Here we present a global synthesis of root observations of species along biotic life form genus and abiotic precipitation soil drainage gradients Results reveal strong sensitivities of rooting depth to local soil water profiles determined by precipitation infiltration depth from the top reflecting climate and soil and groundwater table depth from below reflecting land drainage In uplands rooting depth follows infiltration depth in waterlogged lowlands roots stay shallow avoiding oxygen stress below the water table in between high productivity and drought can send roots many meters down to the groundwater capillary fringe This framework explains the contrasting rooting depths observed under the same climate for the same species but at distinct topographic positions We assess the global significance of these hydrologic mechanisms by estimating root depths using an inverse model based on observed productivity and atmosphere at global grids to capture the topography critical to soil hydrology The resulting patterns of plant rooting depth bear a strong topographic and hydrologic signature at landscape to global scales They underscore a fundamental feedback pathway that may be critical to understanding global change View details for PubMedID 28923923 View details

P on formerly land but depleted total P by 15 at nondegraded sites Climate also influenced soil P response to afforestation with larger P loss in the tropics Afforestation did not appear to directly

attributes that accompany high emitters including depth type plugging status and coal area designation and iii estimate and overall methane emissions from abandoned wells High emitters are best predicted as unplugged gas wells and gas wells in coal areas and appear to be unrelated to the presence of underground natural gas storage areas or unconventional production Repeat measurements over 2 years show that flow rates of high emitters are sustained through time Our methane emission data and our comprehensive estimate of abandoned wells in Pennsylvania result in estimated emissions of Mt 10 12 g CH4 per year This estimate represents of annual anthropogenic methane emissions in Pennsylvania Our methodology combining new field measurements with data mining of previously unavailable well

are often hampered by the complex interactions and among them We examined the effects of changes on ecosystem carbon storage and groundwater recharge in grasslands of Argentina and the United States

driving opposite changes Mg In contrast crops irrigated with ground water tended to reduce both services compared to the natural grasslands they replaced Combining economic values of the agricultural

challenges associated with their quantification Here we review the scientific literature in the fields of atmospheric science and terrestrial ecology in light of three main objectives i to elucidate

reconcile disparities between biogeophysical and biogeochemical forcings and iii acknowledge between global and local climate benefits We call for more coordinated research among terrestrial

II 506 III 508 IV 512 513 VI 514 515 References 515 SUMMARY Fine roots acquire essential soil resources and mediate biogeochemical cycling in terrestrial ecosystems Estimates of carbon and nutrient allocation to build and maintain these structures remain uncertain because of the challenges of consistently measuring and interpreting systems Traditionally fine roots have been defined as all roots 2 mm in diameter yet it is now recognized that this approach fails to capture the diversity of form and function observed among orders Here we demonstrate how and functional classification frameworks improve our understanding of dynamic root processes in ecosystems dominated by perennial plants In these frameworks fine roots are either separated into individual root orders or functionally defined into a absorptive pool and a transport pool Using these frameworks we estimate that production and turnover represent 22 of terrestrial net primary production globally a 30 reduction from previous estimates assuming a single pool Future work developing tools to rapidly differentiate functional classes explicit incorporation of mycorrhizal fungi into studies and wider adoption of a approach to model fine roots provide opportunities to better understand processes in the terrestrial biosphere View details for DOI View details for Web of Science ID 000357824400006 View details for PubMedID

grassland communities in Texas USA 1 a pasture dominated by a C4 exotic grass and 2 assemblages of tallgrass prairie species the latter grown on clay sandy loam and silty clay soils Grasslands were exposed in separate experiments to a to elevated CO2 gradient for 4 years CO2 stimulated ANPP of pasture and of prairie assemblages on each of the three soils but increased leaf δ 15 N only for prairie plants on a silty clay δ 15 N increased linearly as soil C declined on the silty clay C declined as ANPP increased Structural equation modeling indicted that CO2 increased ANPP partly by favoring a tallgrass Sorghastrum nutans over a species Bouteloua curtipendula CO2 may have increased foliar δ 15 N on the silty clay by reducing fractionation during N uptake and assimilation However we interpret the δ 15 response as resulting from increased ANPP that stimulated mineralization from recalcitrant organic matter By contrast CO2 favored a forb species Solanum dimidiatum with higher δ

hydraulic fracturing This paper provides a critical review of the potential risks that shale gas operations pose to water resources with an emphasis on case studies mostly from the Four potential risks for water resources are identified 1 the contamination of shallow aquifers with fugitive hydrocarbon gases stray gas contamination which can also potentially lead to the salinization of shallow groundwater through leaking natural gas wells and subsurface flow 2 the contamination of surface water and shallow groundwater from spills leaks the disposal of inadequately treated shale gas wastewater 3 the accumulation of toxic and radioactive elements in soil or stream sediments near disposal or spill sites and 4 the overextraction of water resources for hydraulic fracturing that could induce water shortages or conflicts with other water users particularly in areas Analysis of published data through January 2014 reveals evidence for stray gas contamination surface water impacts in

Abstract Climate change drivers affect plant community productivity via three pathways i direct effects of drivers on plants ii the response of species abundances to drivers community response and iii the feedback effect of community change on productivity community effect The contribution of each pathway to relationships depends on functional traits of dominant species We used data from three experiments in Texas USA to assess the role of community dynamics in the aboveground net primary productivity ANPP response of C4 grasslands to two climate drivers applied singly atmospheric CO2 enrichment and augmented summer precipitation The response differed among experiments because community responses and effects differed ANPP increased by m per 100 μl l rise in CO2 in separate experiments with pasture and tallgrass prairie assemblages Augmenting ambient precipitation by 128mm during one summer month each year increased ANPP more in native than in exotic communities in a third experiment The community effect accounted for of the ANPP CO2 response in the prairie experiment but little of the response in the pasture experiment The community response to CO2 was linked to species traits associated with greater soil water from reduced transpiration greater height Community effects on the ANPP CO2 response and the greater ANPP response of native than exotic communities to augmented precipitation depended on species differences in transpiration efficiency These results indicate that feedbacks from community change influenced responses However the species traits that

change factors such as increasing atmospheric CO2 and N deposition Using the nifH gene as a molecular marker we studied how the community structure of soil bacteria from temperate pine aspen and sweet gum stands and a brackish tidal marsh responded to multiyear elevated CO2 conditions We also examined how N availability specifically N fertilization interacted with elevated CO2 to affect these communities in the temperate pine forest Based on data from Sanger sequencing and quantitative PCR the soil nifH composition in the three forest systems was dominated by species in the Geobacteraceae and to a lesser extent Alphaproteobacteria The structure was subtly altered after 10 or more years of elevated atmospheric CO2 and the observed shifts differed in each biome In the pine forest N fertilization had a stronger effect on nifH community structure than elevated CO2 and suppressed the diversity and abundance of bacteria under elevated atmospheric CO2 conditions These results indicate that bacteria have complex interacting responses that will be important for understanding ecosystem productivity in a changing climate View details for DOI View details for Web of Science ID

ecohydrologists and biogeochemists need detailed insights into belowground properties and processes including changes in water salts and other elements that can influence ecosystem productivity and

the effect of conversions to agriculture on salt mobilization and leaching across transects and to depths of tens of meters Recent advances in radar and other geophysical imaging methods currently provide opportunities for subsurface imaging with sufficient detail to locate small cm diameter animal burrows and plant roots observe and vegetation spatial correlations in small watersheds estuaries

Contrasting hydraulic architecture and function in deep and shallow roots of tree species from a habitat ANNALS OF BOTANY Johnson Brodersen Reed Domec Jackson B 2014 113 4 Abstract Despite the importance of vessels in angiosperm roots for plant water transport there is little research on the microanatomy of woody plant roots Vessels in roots can be interconnected networks or nearly solitary with few connections Species with few connections are common in arid habitats presumably to isolate embolisms In this study measurements were made of root vessel pit sizes vessel pressures pit membrane thicknesses and the degree of vessel interconnectedness in deep approx 20 m and shallow 10 cm roots of two species Sideroxylon lanuginosum and Quercus electron microscopy was used to image pit dimensions and to measure the distance between connected vessels The number of connected vessels in larger samples was determined by using computed tomography and image analysis Individual vessel pressures were measured using a microcapillary method The thickness of pit membranes was measured using transmission electron pit size varied across both species and rooting depths Deep fusiformis roots had the largest pits overall 500 µm and more large pits than either shallow fusiformis roots or lanuginosum roots Vessel pressures were approximately four times greater in fusiformis than in lanuginosum and times greater in shallow roots than in deep roots Sideroxylon lanuginosum had of its vessels interconnected whereas fusiformis only had of its vessels connected Vessel pressures were unrelated to pit membrane thickness but showed a positive relationship with vessel data support the hypothesis that species with more integration are often less resistant to embolism than species with isolated vessels This study also highlights the usefulness of tomography for vessel network analysis and the important role of xylem organization in plant hydraulic function View details for DOI View

to soil carbon balance under rising CO2 is not well understood Soil properties likely mediate these fungal responses but are rarely explored in CO2 experiments We studied soil fungal communities in a grassland ecosystem exposed to a CO2 gradient 250 to 500 ppm in a black clay soil and a sandy loam soil Sanger sequencing and pyrosequencing of the rRNA gene cluster revealed that fungal community composition and its response to CO2 differed significantly between soils Fungal species richness and relative abundance of Chytridiomycota chytrids increased linearly with CO2 in the black clay P R 2 whereas the relative abundance of Glomeromycota arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi increased linearly with elevated CO2 in the sandy loam P R 2 Across both soils decomposition rate was positively correlated with chytrid relative abundance r and in the black clay soil fungal species richness Decomposition rate was more strongly correlated with microbial biomass r than with fungal variables Increased labile carbon availability with elevated CO2 may explain the greater fungal species richness and Chytridiomycota abundance in the black clay soil whereas increased phosphorus limitation may explain the increase in Glomeromycota at elevated CO2 in the sandy loam Our results demonstrate that soil type plays a key role in soil fungal responses to rising atmospheric CO2 View details for PubMedID

Abstract Soil and plant hydraulics constrain ecosystem productivity by setting physical limits to water transport and hence carbon uptake by leaves While more negative xylem water potentials provide a larger driving force for water transport they also cause cavitation that limits hydraulic conductivity An optimum balance between driving force and cavitation occurs at intermediate water potentials thus defining the maximum transpiration rate the xylem can sustain denoted as E max The presence of this maximum raises the question as to whether plants regulate transpiration through stomata to function near E max To address this question we calculated E max across plant functional types and climates using a hydraulic model and a global database of plant hydraulic traits The predicted E max compared well with measured peak transpiration across plant sizes and growth conditions R P and was relatively conserved among plant types for a given plant size while increasing across climates following the atmospheric evaporative demand The fact that E max was roughly conserved across plant types and scales with the product of xylem saturated conductivity and water potential at 50 cavitation was used here to explain the in plant xylem Stomatal conductance allows maximum transpiration rates despite partial cavitation in the xylem thereby suggesting coordination between stomatal

Domec Jackson B 2013 36 1 Abstract Although climate change will alter both soil water availability and evaporative demand our understanding of how future climate conditions will alter tree hydraulic architecture is limited Here we demonstrate that growth at elevated temperatures ambient affects hydraulic traits in seedlings of the deciduous boreal tree species Populus tremuloides with the strength of the effect varying with the plant organ studied Temperature altered the partitioning of hydraulic resistance with greater resistance attributed to stems and less to roots in seedlings P and a 46 but marginally significant P increase in whole plant conductance at elevated temperature Vulnerability to cavitation was greater in leaves grown at high than at ambient temperatures but vulnerability in stems was similar between treatments A SPA model suggests that these coordinated changes in hydraulic physiology would lead to more frequent drought stress and reduced efficiency in aspen that develop at warmer temperatures in hydraulic traits in response to high growth temperatures would be difficult to detect when relying solely on whole plant measurements but may have

86 Sr 2 18 16 O and 228 226 Ra from this and previous studies in 426 shallow groundwater samples and 83 northern Appalachian brine samples suggest that mixing relationships between shallow ground water and a deep formation brine causes groundwater salinization in some locations The strong geochemical fingerprint in the salinized Cl 20 groundwater sampled from the Alluvium Catskill and Lock Haven aquifers suggests possible migration of Marcellus brine through naturally occurring pathways The occurrences of saline water do not correlate with the location of wells and are consistent with reported data before rapid development in the region however the presence of these fluids suggests conductive pathways and specific geostructural hydrodynamic regimes in northeastern Pennsylvania that are at increased risk for contamination of shallow drinking water resources particularly by fugitive gases because of natural hydraulic connections to deeper formations View details for DOI View

Artaxo Melillo Morgan 2012 41 4 Abstract Geoengineering methods are intended to reduce climate change which is already having demonstrable effects on ecosystem structure and functioning in some regions Two types of geoengineering activities that have been proposed are carbon dioxide CO 2 removal CDR which removes CO 2 from the atmosphere and solar radiation management SRM or sunlight reflection methods which reflects a small percentage of sunlight back into space to offset warming from greenhouse gases GHGs Current research suggests that SRM or CDR might diminish the impacts of climate change on ecosystems by reducing changes in temperature and precipitation However sudden cessation of SRM would exacerbate the climate effects on ecosystems and some CDR might interfere with oceanic and terrestrial ecosystem processes The many risks and uncertainties associated with these new kinds of purposeful perturbations to the Earth system are not well understood and require

We retrospectively assessed soil bacterial community responses in all experiments and found and common patterns of soil bacterial community response to elevated CO 2 Soil bacterial composition differed greatly across the six ecosystems No common effect of elevated atmospheric CO 2 on bacterial biomass richness and community composition across all of the ecosystems was identified although significant responses were detected in individual ecosystems The most striking common trend across the sites was a decrease of up to in the relative abundance of Acidobacteria Group 1 bacteria in soils exposed to elevated CO 2 or other climate factors The Acidobacteria Group 1 response observed in exploratory 16S rRNA gene clone library surveys was validated in one ecosystem by deeper sequencing and PCR assays Collectively the 16S rRNA gene sequencing approach revealed influences of elevated CO 2 on multiple ecosystems Although few common trends across the ecosystems were detected in the small surveys the trends may be harbingers of more substantive changes in less abundant more sensitive taxa that can only be detected by deeper surveys Representative bacterial 16S rRNA gene

isoprene plays important roles in both tropospheric photochemistry and plant metabolism We performed a 13 CO 2 study using mass spectrometry to examine the kinetics of recently assimilated photosynthate into isoprene emitted from poplar Populus canescens trees grown and measured at different atmospheric CO 2 concentrations This is the first study to explicitly consider the effects of altered atmospheric CO 2 concentration on carbon partitioning to isoprene biosynthesis We studied changes in the proportion of labeled carbon as a function of time in two mass fragments M41 which represents in part substrate derived from pyruvate and M69 which represents the whole unlabeled isoprene molecule We observed a trend of slower 13 C incorporation into isoprene carbon derived from pyruvate consistent with the previously hypothesized origin of chloroplastic pyruvate from cytosolic phosphenolpyruvate PEP Trees grown under CO 2 190 ppmv had rates of isoprene emission and rates of labeling of M41 and M69 that were nearly twice those observed in trees grown under elevated CO 2 590 ppmv However they also demonstrated the lowest proportion of completely labeled isoprene molecules These results suggest that under reduced atmospheric CO 2 availability more carbon from carbon sources is involved in isoprene biosynthesis and this carbon most likely enters the isoprene biosynthesis pathway through the pyruvate substrate We offer direct evidence that rather than chloroplastic carbon sources are mobilized to increase the availability of pyruvate required to the isoprene

nitrogen fixation are needed to close the global nitrogen budget and these remain a critical gap in both laboratory and field experiments We present a new method for continuous measurements of ethylene production Acetylene Reduction Assays by Cavity laser Absorption Spectroscopy ARACAS In ARACAS air in the headspace of an incubation chamber is circulated with a diaphragm pump through a

gas chromatography First the detection of acetylene reduction to ethylene is and chemically allowing for measurements of nitrogenase activity Second the measurements are made instantaneously and continuously at ppb levels allowing for observation of kinetics on time intervals as short as a few seconds Third the instrument can be automated for long time periods of measurement Finally the technique will be widely accessible by the research community as it can be readily adapted to most existing acetylene reduction protocols and is based on a modestly priced commercially available instrument We illustrate its use for measuring N 2 fixation using two species the diazotrophic bacterium Azotobacter vinelandii and the lichen Peltigera praetextata We also discuss potential

replacement of native vegetation by pastures or tree plantations is increasing worldwide Contradictory effects of these land use transitions on the direction of changes in soil organic carbon SOC stocks quality and vertical distribution have been reported which could be explained by the characteristics of the new or prior vegetation time since vegetation replacement and environmental conditions We used a series of experiments and a literature synthesis to evaluate how these factors affect SOC contents in transitions between and grazed ecosystems in South America Both our field and literature approaches showed that SOC changes cm of depth were independent of the initial native vegetation forest grassland or savanna but strongly dependent on the characteristics of the new vegetation tree plantations or pastures its age and precipitation Pasture establishment increased SOC contents across all our precipitation gradient and C gains were greater as pastures aged In contrast tree plantations increased SOC stocks in arid sites but decreased them in humid ones However SOC losses in humid sites were counterbalanced by the effect of plantation age as plantations increased their SOC stocks as plantations aged A multiple regression model including age and precipitation explained more than 50 p of SOC changes observed after sowing pastures or planting trees The only clear shift observed in the vertical distribution of SOC occurred when pastures replaced native forests with SOC gains in the surface soil but losses at greater depths The changes in SOC stocks occurred mainly in the soil size fraction MAOM while SOC stocks in labile POM fraction remained relatively constant Our results can be considered in designing strategies to increase SOC storage and soil fertility and highlight the importance of precipitation soil depth and age in determining SOC changes across a range of environments and transitions View details for PubMedID 28741815 The effect

passive movement of water through plant roots driven by gradients in water potential The greater availability resulting from HL may in principle lead to higher plant nutrient uptake but the evidence for this hypothesis is not universally supported by current experiments We grew a grass species common in North America in pots with three treatments 1 the lower layer watered the upper one unwatered HL 2 both layers watered W and 3 the lower layer watered the upper one unwatered but with continuous light 24 h a day to limit HL We inserted ingrowth cores filled with organic matter 15 in the upper layer and tested whether decomposition mineralization and uptake of 15 N were higher in plants performing HL than in plants without HL Soils in the upper layer were significantly wetter in the HL treatment than in the treatment Decomposition rates were similar in the W and HL treatments and lower in On average the concentration of NH 4 in ingrowth cores was highest in the W treatment and NO 3 concentrations were highest in the treatment with HL having intermediate values for both suggesting differential mineralization of organic N among treatments Aboveground biomass leaf 15 N contents and the 15 N uptake in aboveground tissues were higher in W and HL than in indicating higher nutrient uptake and improved N status of plants performing HL However there were no differences in total root nitrogen content or 15 N uptake by roots indicating that HL affected plant allocation of acquired N to photosynthetic tissues Our evidence for the role of HL in organic matter decomposition and nutrient cycling suggests that HL could have positive effects on plant nutrient dynamics and nutrient turnover View details for DOI View details for Web of Science ID 000299058100002 View details for

2012 Soil C and N changes with afforestation of grasslands across gradients of precipitation and plantation age ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS Berthrong Pineiro Jobbagy Jackson B 2012 22 1 Abstract Afforestation the conversion of unforested lands to forests is a tool for sequestering anthropogenic carbon dioxide into plant biomass However in addition to altering biomass afforestation can have substantial effects on soil organic carbon SOC pools some of which have much longer turnover times than plant biomass An increasing body of evidence suggests that the effect of afforestation on SOC may depend on mean annual precipitation MAP The goal of this study was to test how labile and bulk pools of SOC and total soil nitrogen TN change with afforestation across a rainfall gradient of mm in the Rio de la Plata grasslands of Argentina and Uruguay The sites were all former grasslands planted with Eucalyptus spp Overall we found that afforestation increased up to 1012 kg C x ha x yr or decreased as much as 1294 kg C x ha x yr SOC pools in this region and that these changes were significantly related to MAP Drier sites gained and wetter sites lost SOC and TN r2 P and r2 P respectively Labile C and N in microbial biomass and extractable soil pools followed similar patterns to bulk SOC and TN Interestingly drier sites gained more SOC and TN as plantations aged while losses reversed as plantations aged in wet sites suggesting that plantation age in addition to precipitation is a critical driver of changes in soil organic matter with afforestation This new evidence implies that longer intervals between harvests for plantations could improve SOC storage ameliorating the negative trends found in humid sites Our results suggest that the value of afforestation as a carbon sequestration tool should be considered in the context of precipitation and age of the forest stand View details for Web of Science ID 000301095600007 View details for PubMedID 22471076

availability of cellulose in soil to microbial decomposers As key cellulose degraders soil fungi are likely to be one of the most impacted and responsive microbial groups to elevated atmospheric CO 2 To investigate the impacts of ecosystem type and elevated atmospheric CO 2 on cellulolytic fungal communities we sequenced cbhI gene fragments encoding the catalytic subunit of cellobiohydrolase I across five distinct terrestrial ecosystem experiments after a decade of exposure to elevated CO 2 The cbhI composition of each ecosystem was distinct as supported by weighted Unifrac analyses all with few operational taxonomic units OTUs being shared across ecosystems Using a cbhI sequence database compiled from known fungi less than 1 of the environmental sequences could be classified at the family level indicating that cellulolytic fungi in situ are likely dominated by novel fungi or known fungi that are not yet recognized as cellulose degraders Shifts in fungal cbhI composition and richness that were correlated with elevated CO 2 exposure varied across the ecosystems In aspen plantation and desert creosote bush soils cbhI gene richness was significantly higher after exposure to elevated CO 2 550 µmol mol than under ambient CO 2 360 µmol mol CO 2 In contrast while the richness was not altered the relative abundance of dominant OTUs in desert soil crusts was significantly shifted This suggests that responses are complex vary across different ecosystems and in at least one case are Collectively our results document the complexity of cellulolytic fungal communities in

Conversions of natural woodlands to agriculture can alter the hydrologic balance aquifer recharge and salinity of soils and groundwater in ways that influence productivity and sustainable land use Using a change chronosequence in semiarid woodlands of Argentina Espinal province we examined the distribution of moisture and solutes and estimated recharge rates on adjacent plots of native woodlands and agriculture converted years previously Soil coring and geoelectrical profiling confirmed the presence of spatially extensive salt accumulations in dry woodlands and pervasive salt losses in areas converted to agriculture A electrical resistivity transect traversing woodland agriculture and woodland for instance revealed a horizon between approximately 3 m and 13 m depth in the woodlands that was virtually absent in the agricultural site because of leaching soil profiles indicated a 53 increase in soil water storage after 30 or more years of cultivation Conservative estimates based on chloride tracer methods in agricultural plots ranged from approximately 12 to 45 a substantial increase from the 1 recharge in dry woodlands The onset of deep soil moisture drainage and increased recharge led to 95 loss of sulfate and chloride ions from the shallow vadose zone in most agriculture plots These losses correspond to over 100 Mg of sulfate and chloride salts potentially released to the region groundwater aquifers through time with each hectare of deforestation including a capacity to increase groundwater salinity to 4000 from these ions alone Similarities

and policy discussions We examine the evidence for carbon benefits environmental and monetary costs risks and for a variety of activities in three general strategies 1 land use change to increase forest area afforestation and avoid deforestation 2 carbon management in existing forests and 3 the use of wood as biomass energy in place of other building materials or in wood products for carbon storage We found that many strategies can increase forest sector carbon mitigation above the current Tg and that many strategies have such as biodiversity water and economic opportunities Each strategy also has risks and uncertainties including possible leakage permanence disturbances and climate change effects Because approximately 60 of the carbon lost through deforestation and harvesting from 1700 to 1935 has not yet been recovered and because some strategies store carbon in forest products or use biomass energy the biological potential for forest sector carbon mitigation is large Several studies suggest that using these strategies could offset as much as of current fossil fuel emissions To obtain such large offsets in the United States would require a combination of afforesting up to of cropland or pastureland using the equivalent of about of the gross annual forest growth for biomass energy or implementing more intensive management to increase forest growth on of forestland Such large offsets would require substantial such as lower agricultural production and ecosystem services from forests The effectiveness of activities could be diluted by negative leakage effects and increasing disturbance regimes Because forest carbon loss contributes to increasing climate risk and because climate change may impede regeneration following disturbance avoiding deforestation and promoting regeneration after disturbance should receive high priority as policy considerations Policies to encourage programs or projects that influence forest carbon sequestration and offset fossil fuel emissions should also consider major items such as leakage the cyclical nature of forest growth and regrowth and the extensive demand for and movement of forest products globally and other greenhouse gas effects such as methane and nitrous oxide emissions and recognize other environmental benefits of forests such as biodiversity nutrient management and watershed

for isoprene in maintaining photosynthesis under transient heat and light stress from sunflecks Isoprene production is also inversely correlated with CO 2 concentrations implying that rising CO 2 may reduce the functional importance of isoprene To understand the importance of isoprene in maintaining photosynthesis during sunflecks we used RNAi technology to suppress isoprene production in poplar seedlings and compared the responses of these transgenic plants to and control plants We grew and trees at low 190 ppm and high 590 ppm CO 2 concentrations and compared their photosynthetic responses to short transient periods of high light and temperature as well as their photosynthetic thermal response at constant light While there was little difference between emitting and plants in their photosynthetic responses to simulated sunflecks at high CO 2 trees grown at low CO 2 had significantly greater photosynthetic sunfleck tolerance than plants Net photosynthesis at was 50 lower in than in trees at low CO 2 but only 22 lower at high CO 2 Dark respiration rates were significantly higher in poplar from low CO 2 but there was no difference between and lines at high CO 2 We propose that isoprene biosynthesis may have evolved at low CO 2 concentrations where its physiological effect is greatest and that rising CO 2 will reduce the functional benefit of isoprene in the near future View

South America the presence of Prosopis flexuosa woodlands in the Monte Desert region east of the Andes has puzzled scientists for decades Today these woodlands provide crucial subsistence to local populations including descendants of the indigenous Huarpes We explore the vulnerability and importance of phreatic groundwater for the productivity of the region comparing the contributions of local

composition of phreatic groundwaters delta2H per thousand 5 per thousand closely matched the signature of water brought to the region by the Mendoza River per thousand 6 per thousand suggestin that infiltration rather than in situ rainfall deep drainage per thousand 19 per thousand was the dominant mechanism of recharge Similarly chloride mass balances determined from deep soil profiles 6 m suggested very low recharge rates Vegetation in woodland ecosystems where significant groundwater discharge losses likely 100 occurred relied on regionally derived groundwater located from to m underground At these locations daily fluctuations of 10 mm and measurements of plant water indicated groundwater uptake rates of Regional scaling suggests that groundwater evapotranspiration reaches

Texas to understand how deep root systems facilitate HR Sap flow was measured in 9 trunks 47 shallow roots and 12 deep roots of Quercus Bumelia and Prosopis trees over 12 months HR was extensive and continuous involving every tree and 83 of roots with the total daily volume of HR over a 1 month period estimated to be approximately 22 of daily transpiration During drought deep roots at 20 m depth redistributed water to shallow roots hydraulic lift while after rain shallow roots at m depth redistributed water among other shallow roots lateral HR The main driver of HR appeared to be patchy dry soil near the surface although water may also have been redistributed to depths via deeper lateral roots Deep roots contributed up to five times more water to transpiration and HR than shallow roots during drought but dramatically reduced their contribution after rain Our results suggest that plants are important drivers of water cycling in dry ecosystems and that HR can significantly influence

nitrogen N cycling have traditionally focused on N mineralization as the primary process limiting plant assimilation of Recent evidence has shown that plants may assimilate amino acids AAs directly circumventing the mineralization pathway However the general abundance of soil AAs and their relative importance in plant N uptake remains unclear in most ecosystems We compared the concentrations and potential production rates of AAs and NH 4 as well as the edaphic factors that influence AA dynamics in 84 soils across the United States Across all sites NH 4 and comprised similar proportions of the total bioavailable N pool approximately 20 with NO 3 being the dominant form of extractable N everywhere but in tundra and boreal forest soils Potential rates of AA production were at least comparable to those of NH 4 production in all ecosystems particularly in grasslands where AA production rates were six times greater than for NH 4 P Potential rates of proteolytic enzyme activity were greatest in soils with low NH 4 concentrations including many grassland soils Based on research performed under standardized laboratory conditions our analyses suggest that soil AA and NH 4 concentrations are similar in most soils and that AAs may contribute to plant and microbial N demand in most ecosystems particularly in ecosystems with soils View details for DOI View details for Web of Science ID

Padilla Pugnaire Jackson B 2010 162 1 Abstract The different abilities of plant species to use ephemeral or permanent water sources strongly affect physiological performance and species coexistence in ecosystems In addition to withstanding drought plants in coastal habitats often have to withstand highly saline soils an additional ecological stress Here we tested whether observed competitive abilities and relations of two interacting shrub species from an arid coastal system were more related to differences in root architecture or salinity tolerance We explored water sources of interacting Juniperus phoenicea Guss and Pistacia lentiscus plants by conducting physiology measurements including water relations CO2 exchange photochemical efficiency sap osmolality and water and C isotopes We also conducted parallel soil analyses that included electrical conductivity humidity and water isotopes During drought Pistacia shrubs relied primarily on permanent salty groundwater while isolated Juniperus plants took up the scarce and relatively fresh water stored in upper soil layers As drought progressed further the physiological activity of Juniperus plants nearly stopped while Pistacia plants were only slightly affected Juniperus plants growing with Pistacia had isotopes that matched Pistacia unlike values for isolated Juniperus plants This result suggests that Pistacia shrubs supplied water to nearby Juniperus plants through hydraulic lift This lifted water however did not appear to benefit Juniperus plants as their physiological performance with Pistacia plants was poor including lower water potentials and rates of photosynthesis than isolated plants Juniperus was more salt sensitive than Pistacia which withstood salinity levels similar to that of groundwater Overall the different abilities of the two species to use salty water appear to drive the outcome of their interaction resulting in asymmetric competition where Juniperus is negatively affected by Pistacia Salt also seems to mediate the interaction between the two species negating the potential positive effects of an additional water source via hydraulic lift View details for DOI View details

Abstract The potential for elevated CO 2 changes to plant carbon C storage through modifications in plant production and allocation of C among plant pools is an important source of uncertainty when predicting future forest function Utilizing 10 yr of data from the Duke CO 2 enrichment site we evaluated the dynamics and distribution of plant Discrepancy between heights measured for this study and previously calculated heights required revision of earlier allometrically based biomass determinations resulting in higher up to 50 estimates of standing biomass and net primary productivity than previous assessments Generally elevated CO 2 caused sustained increases in plant biomass production and in standing C but did not affect the partitioning of C among plant biomass pools Spatial variation in net primary productivity and its CO 2 enhancement was controlled primarily by N availability with the difference between precipitation and potential evapotranspiration explaining most interannual variability Consequently CO 2 net primary productivity enhancement ranged from 22 to 30 in different plots and years Through quantifying the effects of nutrient and water availability on the forest productivity response to elevated CO 2 we show that net primary productivity enhancement by elevated CO 2 is not uniform but rather highly dependent on the availability of other growth

increased by 24 or 59 26 C biomass sampled in 2008 was twice as great in elevated CO2 and suggests a storage of approximately 20 g C x m x yr Root C and N concentrations were unchanged suggesting greater belowground plant demand for N in high CO2 Soil respiration was significantly higher by 23 on average as assessed by instantaneous infrared gas analysis and integrated estimates N fertilization decreased soil respiration and biomass by approximately in both ambient and elevated CO2 In recent years increases in root biomass and soil respiration grew stronger averaging approximately 30 at high CO2 Peak changes for root biomass soil respiration and other variables typically occurred in midsummer and diminished in winter Soil CO2 concentrations between 15 and 100 cm

potentially influencing soil acidity and rates of weathering Soil solution and total base cation concentrations were 140 and 176 greater respectively in elevated CO2 at 200 cm depth Similar increases

Jobbagy Jackson B 2009 19 8 Abstract Afforestation the conversion of lands to forest plantations can sequester atmospheric carbon dioxide but the rapid growth and harvesting of biomass may deplete nutrients and degrade soils if managed improperly The goal of this study is to evaluate how afforestation affects mineral soil quality including pH sodium exchangeable cations organic carbon and nitrogen and to examine the magnitude of these changes regionally where afforestation rates are high We also examine potential mechanisms to reduce the impacts of afforestation on soils and to maintain productivity Across diverse plantation types 153 sites to a depth of 30 cm of mineral soil we observed significant decreases in nutrient cations Ca K Mg increases in sodium Na or both with afforestation Across the data set afforestation reduced soil concentrations of the macronutrient Ca by 29 on average P Afforestation by Pinus alone decreased soil K by 23 P Overall plantations of all genera also led to a mean 71 increase of soil Na P Mean pH decreased units P with afforestation Afforestation caused a and 15 P decrease in soil C and N content respectively though the effect was driven principally by Pinus plantations 15 and 20 decrease P Carbon to nitrogen ratios in soils under plantations were higher P In several regions with high rates of afforestation cumulative losses of N Ca and Mg are likely in the range of tens of millions of metric tons The decreases indicate that trees take up considerable amounts of nutrients from soils harvesting this biomass repeatedly could impair soil fertility and productivity in some locations Based on this study and a review of other literature we suggest that proper site preparation and sustainable harvest practices such as avoiding the removal or burning of harvest residue could minimize the impact of afforestation on soils These sustainable practices would in turn slow soil compaction erosion and organic matter loss maintaining

Berthrong Schadt Pineiro Jackson B 2009 75 19 Abstract Soil microbes are highly diverse and control most soil biogeochemical reactions We examined how microbial functional genes and biogeochemical pools responded to the altered chemical inputs accompanying land use change We examined paired native grasslands and adjacent Eucalyptus plantations previously grassland in Uruguay a region that lacked forests before European settlement Along with measurements of soil carbon nitrogen and bacterial diversity we analyzed functional genes using the GeoChip microarray which simultaneously quantified several thousand genes involved in soil carbon and nitrogen cycling Plantations and grassland differed significantly in functional gene profiles bacterial diversity and biogeochemical pool sizes Most grassland profiles were similar but plantation profiles generally differed from those of grasslands due to differences in functional gene abundance across diverse taxa Eucalypts decreased ammonification and N fixation functional genes by 11 and P which correlated with decreased microbial biomass N and more NH 4 in plantation soils Chitinase abundance decreased in plantations compared to levels in grassland P and C genes decreased by overall P which likely contributed to 54 P more C in undecomposed extractable soil pools and 27 less microbial C P in plantation soils In general afforestation altered the abundance of many microbial functional genes corresponding with changes in soil biogeochemistry in part through altered abundance of overall functional gene types rather than simply through changes in specific taxa Such changes in microbial functional genes correspond with altered C and N storage and have implications for productivity in these soils View details for DOI

sequestration in sandstone saline reservoirs holds great potential for mitigating climate change but its storage potential and cost per ton of avoided CO2 emissions are uncertain We develop a general model to determine the maximum theoretical constraints on both storage potential and injection rate and use it to characterize the economic viability of geosequestration in sandstone saline aquifers When applied to a representative set of aquifer characteristics the model yields results that compare favorably with pilot projects currently underway Over a range of reservoir properties maximum effective storage peaks at an optimal depth of 1600 m at which point metric tons can be stored per cubic meter of bulk volume of reservoir Maximum modeled injection rates predict minima for storage costs in a typical basin in the range of ton CO2 2005 depending on depth and basin characteristics in our scenario Because the properties of natural reservoirs in the United States vary substantially storage costs could in some cases be lower or higher by orders of magnitude We conclude that available geosequestration capacity exhibits a wide range of technological and economic attractiveness Like

2009 19 2 Abstract Although various studies have shown that corn ethanol reduces greenhouse gas GHG emissions by displacing fossil fuel use many of these studies fail to include how history affects the net carbon balance through changes in soil carbon content We evaluated the effectiveness and economic value of corn and cellulosic ethanol production for reducing net GHG emissions when produced on lands with different histories comparing these strategies with reductions achieved by programs such as the Conservation Reserve Program CRP Depending on prior land use our analysis shows that C releases from the soil after planting corn for ethanol may in some cases completely offset C gains attributed to biofuel generation for at least 50 years More surprisingly based on our comprehensive analysis of 142 soil studies soil C sequestered by setting aside former agricultural land was greater than the C credits generated by planting corn for ethanol on the same land for 40 years and had equal or greater economic net present value Once commercially available cellulosic ethanol produced in grasslands should provide the most efficient tool for GHG reduction of any scenario we examined Our results suggest that conversion of CRP lands or other programs to corn ethanol production should not be encouraged through greenhouse gas policies View details for Web of Science ID

cyanide and 2 improve yearly estimates of R r by directly measuring its Q 10 in situ using cuvettes buried around intact attached roots The proximal limits of R r of loblolly pine Pinus taeda trees exposed to CO 2 enrichment FACE and N fertilization were seasonally variable enzyme capacity limited R r in the winter and a combination of substrate supply and adenylate availability limited R r in summer months The limiting factors of R r were not affected by elevated CO 2 or N fertilization Elevated CO 2 increased annual R r by 34 whereas the combination of elevated CO 2 and N fertilization reduced R r by 40 Measurements of in situ R r with high temporal resolution detected diel patterns that were correlated with canopy photosynthesis with a lag of 1 d or less as measured by eddy

controlled by the initial chemical composition of the residues We used a data set of approximately 2800 observations to show that these global patterns can be explained by fundamental stoichiometric relationships of decomposer activity We show how litter quality controls the transition from nitrogen accumulation into the litter to release and alters decomposers respiration patterns Our results

influence on parameter estimations The influence of analysis method was also evaluated by applying nonlinear and linear regressions to the original data Results showed that a relative large sample size was required to lower statistical inference errors When sample size n was 10 of the base population size 35 of the samples supported 39 supported and 15 rejected even though the base population had a The controversy surrounding the estimation of beta in the literature could be partially attributable to such small sample sizes in many studies Measurement errors in body mass and base metabolic rate especially in body mass could largely increase alpha and beta errors Analysis methods also affected parameter estimations Nonlinear regressions provided better estimates of the scaling exponent that were significantly higher than these commonly estimated by linear regressions This study demonstrated the importance of the quantity and quality of data as well as analysis method in power law

study has compared the diversities of the four major microbial taxa bacteria archaea fungi and viruses from an individual soil sample We used metagenomic and sequence analysis techniques to compare the estimated richness and evenness of these groups in prairie desert and rainforest soils By grouping sequences at the 97 sequence similarity level an operational taxonomic unit OTU we found that the archaeal and fungal communities were consistently less even than the bacterial communities Although total richness levels are difficult to estimate with a high degree of certainty the estimated number of unique archaeal or fungal OTUs appears to rival or exceed the number of unique bacterial OTUs in each of the collected soils In this first study to comprehensively survey viral communities using a metagenomic approach we found that soil viruses are taxonomically diverse and distinct from the communities of viruses found in other environments that have been surveyed using a similar approach

McElrone Bichler Pockman Addington Linder Jackson B 2007 30 11 Abstract Although deep roots can contribute substantially to water use little is known about deep root functioning because of limited access for in situ measurements We used a cave system on the Edwards Plateau of central Texas to investigate the physiology of water transport in roots at m depth for two common tree species Quercus fusiformis and Bumelia lanuginosa Using sap flow and water potential measurements on deep roots we found that calculated root hydraulic conductivity RHC fluctuated diurnally for both species and decreased under shading for lanuginosa To assess whether these dynamic changes in RHC were regulated during initial water absorption by fine roots we used an flowmeter and hydroxyl radical inhibition to measure in situ fine root hydraulic conductivity FRHC and aquaporin contribution to FRHC AQPC respectively During the summer FRHC and AQPC were found to cycle diurnally in both species with peaks corresponding to the period of highest transpirational demand at midday During shade treatments lanuginosa FRHC ceased diurnal cycling and decreased by 75 and 35 at midday and midnight respectively while AQPC decreased by 41 and 30 during both time periods A controlled study using hydroponically grown saplings confirmed daily cycling and reductions in FRHC and AQPC Winter measurements showed that the evergreen fusiformis maintained high FRHC and AQPC throughout the year while the deciduous lanuginosa ceased diurnal cycling and exhibited its lowest annual values for both parameters in winter Adjustments in FRHC and AQPC to changing canopy water demands may help the trees maintain the use of reliable water resources from depth and contribute to the success of these species in this

most strongly correlated with the relative distance between communities Spearman p P although there were other contributing factors including the quality of the fine benthic organic matter and the amount of dissolved organic carbon and nitrogen in the stream water P for each There was no evidence of an effect of geographic distance on bacterial community composition suggesting that dispersal limitation has little influence on the observed biogeographical patterns in streams across this landscape Cloning and sequencing of rRNA genes confirmed the DNA fingerprinting results and revealed strong shifts among bacterial groups along the pH gradient With an increase in streamwater pH the abundance of acidobacteria in the FBOM bacterial community decreased from 71 to 38 and the abundance of proteobacteria increased from 11 to 47 Together these results suggest that microorganisms like macro do exhibit biogeographical patterns at the landscape scale and that these patterns may be

Kubiske Ledford Liberloo Oren Polle Pritchard Zak Schlesinger Ceulemans 2007 104 35 Abstract Forest ecosystems are important sinks for rising concentrations of atmospheric CO 2 In previous research we showed that net primary production NPP increased by 23 2 when four experimental forests were grown under atmospheric concentrations of CO 2 predicted for the latter half of this century Because nitrogen N availability commonly limits forest productivity some combination of increased N uptake from the soil and more efficient use of the N already assimilated by trees is necessary to sustain the high rates of forest NPP under CO 2 enrichment FACE In this study experimental evidence demonstrates that the uptake of N increased under elevated CO 2 at the Rhinelander Duke and Oak Ridge National Laboratory FACE sites yet fertilization studies at the Duke and Oak Ridge National Laboratory FACE sites showed that tree growth and forest NPP were strongly limited by N availability By contrast efficiency increased under elevated CO 2 at the site where fertilization studies showed that N was not limiting to tree growth Some combination of increasing fine root production increased rates of soil organic matter decomposition and increased allocation of carbon C to mycorrhizal fungi is likely to account for greater N uptake under elevated CO 2 Regardless of the specific mechanism this analysis shows that the larger quantities of C entering the system under elevated CO 2 result in greater N uptake even in ecosystems Biogeochemical models must be reformulated to allow C transfers below ground that result in additional N uptake under elevated CO 2 View details for DOI View details for Web of Science ID 000249187500030 View details for PubMedID 17709743 Toward an

largely unable to interpret this information in an ecological context including which groups of bacteria are most abundant in different soils and why With this study we examined how the abundances of major soil bacterial phyla correspond to the biotic and abiotic characteristics of the soil environment to determine if they can be divided into ecologically meaningful categories To do this we collected 71 unique soil samples from a wide range of ecosystems across North America and looked for relationships between soil properties and the relative abundances of six dominant bacterial phyla Acidobacteria Bacteroidetes Firmicutes Actinobacteria and the Of the soil properties measured net carbon C mineralization rate an index of C availability was the best predictor of abundances There was a negative correlation between Acidobacteria abundance and C mineralization rates r2 P while the abundances of and Bacteroidetes were positively correlated with C mineralization rates r2 P and r2 P respectively These patterns were explored further using both experimental and approaches We amended soil cores from a specific site with varying levels of sucrose over a period to maintain a gradient of elevated C availabilities This experiment confirmed our survey results there was a negative relationship between C amendment level and the abundance of Acidobacteria r2 P and a positive relationship for both Bacteroidetes and r2 and respectively P for each Further support for a relationship between the relative abundances of these bacterial phyla and C availability was garnered from an analysis of published bacterial clone libraries from bulk and rhizosphere soils Together our survey experimental and results suggest that certain bacterial phyla can be differentiated into copiotrophic and oligotrophic categories that correspond to the and categories used to describe the ecological attributes of plants and animals By applying the concept to soil microorganisms we can

Functional coordination between leaf gas exchange and vulnerability to xylem cavitation in temperate forest trees PLANT CELL AND ENVIRONMENT Maherali Moura Caldeira Willson Jackson B 2006 29 4 Abstract We examined functional coordination among stem and root vulnerability to xylem cavitation plant water transport characteristics and leaf traits in 14 temperate tree species Relationships were evaluated using both traditional correlations and phylogenetically independent contrast PIC correlations For stems the xylem tension at which 50 of hydraulic conductivity was lost psi50 was positively associated P with specific conductivity K S and with mean hydraulically weighted xylem conduit diameter D but was only marginally P associated with leaf specific conductivity K L The PIC correlation for each of these relationships however was not statistically significant There was also no relationship between root psi50 and root K S in either or PIC analysis Photosynthetic rate A and stomatal conductance g s were strongly and positively correlated with root psi50 in the analysis P a relationship that was robust to phylogenetic correction P A and g s were also positively correlated with stem psi50 in the analysis P and respectively However only A was associated with stem psi50 in the PIC analysis P Although the relationship between vulnerability to cavitation and xylem conductivity traits within specific organs stems and roots was weak the strong correlation between g s and root psi50 across species suggests that there is a between vulnerability to cavitation and water transport capacity at the level Our results were therefore consistent with the expectation of coordination between vulnerability to xylem cavitation and the regulation of stomatal conductance and highlight the potential physiological and evolutionary significance of root hydraulic properties in controlling interspecific variation in leaf function View details for DOI View details for Web of Science ID

Jackson B 2006 103 3 Abstract For centuries biologists have studied patterns of plant and animal diversity at continental scales Until recently similar studies were impossible for microorganisms arguably the most diverse and abundant group of organisms on Earth Here we present a description of soil bacterial communities and the environmental factors influencing their biodiversity We collected 98 soil samples from across North and South America and used a ribosomal method to compare bacterial community composition and diversity quantitatively across sites Bacterial diversity was unrelated to site temperature latitude and other variables that typically predict plant and animal diversity and community composition was largely independent of geographic distance The diversity and richness of soil bacterial communities differed by ecosystem type and these differences could largely be explained by soil pH r 2 and r 2 respectively P in both cases Bacterial diversity was highest in neutral soils and lower in acidic soils with soils from the Peruvian Amazon the most acidic and least diverse in our study Our results suggest that microbial biogeography is controlled primarily by edaphic

interaction between nitrogen cycling and carbon sequestration is critical in predicting the consequences of anthropogenic increases in atmospheric CO2 hereafter Ca The progressive N limitation PNL theory predicts that carbon sequestration in plants and soils with rising Ca may be constrained by the availability of nitrogen in many ecosystems Here we report on the interaction between C and N dynamics during a field experiment in which an intact grassland was exposed to a gradient in Ca from 200 to 560 There were strong species effects on decomposition dynamics with C loss positively correlated and N mineralization negatively correlated with Ca for litter of the C3 forb Solanum dimidiatum whereas decomposition of litter from the C4 grass Bothriochloa ischaemum was unresponsive to Ca Both soil microbial biomass and soil respiration rates exhibited a nonlinear response to Ca reaching a maximum at approximately 440 Ca We found a general movement of N out of soil organic matter and into aboveground plant biomass with increased Ca Within soils we found evidence of C loss from recalcitrant soil C fractions with narrow C N ratios to more labile soil fractions with broader C N ratios potentially due to decreases in N availability The observed reallocation of N from soil to plants over the last three years of the experiment supports the PNL theory that reductions in N availability with rising Ca could initially be overcome by a transfer of N from low C N ratio fractions to those with higher C N ratios Although the transfer of N allowed plant production to increase with increasing Ca there was no net soil C sequestration at elevated Ca presumably because relatively stable C is being decomposed to meet microbial and plant N requirements Ultimately if the C gained by increased plant production is rapidly lost through decomposition the shift in N from older soil organic matter to rapidly decomposing plant tissue may limit net C sequestration with increased plant production View details for Web of Science ID 000236020000006 View details for PubMedID 16634295 Geographical and interannual variability in biomass partitioning in grassland ecosystems a synthesis of

f BNPP defined as the fraction of belowground net primary productivity BNPP to total NPP and its relationship with climatic variables have not been explored Here we addressed these issues by synthesizing 94 field biomass data at 12 grassland sites around the world from a global NPP database and from the literature Results showed that f BNPP varied from to across 12 sites In general savanna and humid savanna ecosystems had smaller f BNPP but larger interannual variability in f BNPP and cold desert steppes had larger f BNPP but smaller interannual variability While mean f BNPP at a site decreased significantly with increasing mean annual temperature and precipitation across sites no consistent temporal response of f BNPP with annual temperature and precipitation was found within sites Based on these results both geographical variability in f BNPP and the divergent responses of f BNPP with climatic variables at geographical and temporal scales should be considered in

forest ECOLOGY Finzi Moore DeLucia Lichter Hofmockel Jackson Kim Matamala McCarthy Oren Pippen Schlesinger 2006 87 1 Abstract A hypothesis for progressive nitrogen limitation PNL proposes that net primary production NPP will decline through time in ecosystems subjected to a increase in atmospheric CO2 The primary mechanism driving this response is a rapid rate of N immobilization by plants and microbes under elevated CO2 that depletes soils of N causing slower rates of N mineralization Under this hypothesis there is little stimulation of NPP by elevated CO2 in the absence of exogenous inputs of We tested this hypothesis using data on the pools and fluxes of C and N in tree biomass microbes and soils from 1997 through 2002 collected at the Duke Forest CO2 enrichment FACE experiment Elevated CO2 stimulated NPP by during the first six years of this experiment Consistent with the hypothesis for PNL significantly more N was immobilized in tree biomass and in the O horizon under elevated CO2 In contrast to the PNL hypothesis immobilization did not increase under elevated CO2 and although the rate of net N mineralization declined through time the decline was not significantly more rapid under elevated CO2 Ecosystem ratios widened more rapidly under elevated CO2 than ambient CO2 indicating a more rapid rate of C fixation per unit of N a processes that could delay PNL in this ecosystem Mass balance calculations demonstrated a large accrual of ecosystem N capital Is PNL occurring in this ecosystem and will NPP decline to levels under ambient CO2 The answer depends on the relative strength of tree biomass and N immobilization widening ratios and accrual as processes that drive and delay PNL respectively Only direct observations through time will definitively answer

145 4 Abstract The invasion of African grasses into Neotropical savannas has altered savanna composition structure and function The projected increase in atmospheric CO 2 concentration has the potential to further alter the competitive relationship between native and invader grasses The objective of this study was to quantify the responses of two populations of a widespread native C 4 grass Trachypogon plumosus and two African C 4 grass invaders Hyparrhenia rufa and Melinis minutiflora to high CO 2 concentration interacting with two primary savanna stressors drought and herbivory Elevated CO 2 increased the competitive potential of invader grasses in several ways Germination and seedling size was promoted in introduced grasses Under high CO 2 the relative growth rate of young introduced grasses was twice that of native grass g g week vs g g week This initial growth advantage was maintained throughout the course of the study and unstressed African grasses also responded more to high CO 2 than did the native grass biomass increases of compared with decreases of Observed higher water and nitrogen use efficiency of invader grasses may aid their establishment and competitive strength in unfertile sites specially if the climate becomes drier In addition high CO 2 promoted lower leaf N content more in the invader grasses The more intensive land use predicted to occur in this region may interact with high CO 2 to favor the African grasses as they generally recovered faster after simulated herbivory The superiority of invader grasses under high CO 2 suggests further increases in their competitive strength and a potential increased rate of displacement of the native savannas in the future by grasslands dominated by introduced African species View details

B 2005 59 4 Abstract Physiological traits that control the uptake of carbon dioxide and loss of water are key determinants of plant growth and reproduction Variation in these traits is often correlated with environmental gradients of water light and nutrients suggesting that natural selection is the primary evolutionary mechanism responsible for physiological diversification Responses to selection however can be constrained by the amount of standing genetic variation for physiological traits and genetic correlations between these traits To examine the potential for constraint on adaptive evolution we estimated the quantitative genetic basis of physiological trait variation in one population of each of two closely related species Lobelia siphilitica and cardinalis Restricted maximum likelihood analyses of families were used to estimate genetic variances and covariances for seven traits associated with carbon and water relations We detected significant genetic variation for all traits in siphilitica suggesting that and traits could evolve in response to natural selection in this population In particular heritabilities for photosynthetic rate A stomatal conductance gs and efficiency WUE in our siphilitica population were high relative to previous studies in other species Although there was significant heritability for A in cardinalis we detected little genetic variation for traits associated with water use gs and WUE suggesting that our population of this species may be unable to adapt to drier environments Despite being tightly linked functionally the genetic correlation between A and gs was not strong and significant in either population Therefore our siphilitica population would not be genetically constrained from evolving high A and thus fixing more carbon for growth and reproduction while also decreasing gs to limit water loss However a significant negative genetic correlation existed between WUE and plant size in siphilitica suggesting that high WUE may be negatively associated with high fecundity In contrast our results suggest that any constraints on the evolution of photosynthetic and stomatal traits of cardinalis are caused primarily by a lack of genetic variation rather than by genetic correlations between these functionally related traits View details for Web of Science ID 000228734300010 View details for PubMedID

4 Abstract Explanations for the occurrence of plants in arid and ecosystems have traditionally emphasized the uptake of relatively deep soil water However recent hydrologic data from arid systems show that soil water potentials at depth fluctuate little over long time periods suggesting this water may be rarely utilized or replenished In this study we examine the distributions of root biomass soil moisture and nutrient contents to depths at five and arid sites across southwestern USA We couple these depth distributions with strontium Sr isotope data that show deep 1 m nutrient uptake is prevalent at four of the five sites At all of the sites the highest abundance of one or more of the measured nutrients occurred deep within the soil profile particularly for P and Phosphate contents were greater at depth than in the top meter of soil at three of five sites At Jornada for example the m depth increment had twice the extractable P as the top meter of soil despite the highest concentrations of P occurring at the surface The prevalence of such deep resource pools and our evidence for cation uptake from them suggest nutrient uptake as a complementary explanation for the occurrence of plants in arid and systems We propose that hydraulic redistribution of shallow surface water to deep soil layers by roots may be the mechanism through which deep soil nutrients are

production With climate change increasingly likely strategies to reduce carbon emissions and stabilize climate are needed including greater energy efficiency renewable energy sources geoengineering decarbonization and geological and biological sequestration Two of the most commonly proposed biological strategies are restoring organic carbon in agricultural soils and using plantations to sequester carbon in soils and wood Here we compare scenarios of sequestration to emissions reductions arising from increased fuel efficiency in transportation targeting ways to reduce net emissions by 10 approximately Pg of carbon per year Based on mean sequestration rates converting all croplands to agriculture or retiring them completely could sequester approximately Pg of carbon per year for several decades Summary data across a range of plantations reveal an average rate of carbon storage an order of magnitude larger than in agricultural soils in consequence of croplands or 44 million hectares would be needed for plantations to reach the target of approximately Pg of carbon per year For fossil fuel reductions cars and light trucks generated approximately Pg of carbon in emissions in 2001 To reduce net emissions by Pg of carbon per year a doubling of fuel efficiency for cars and light trucks is needed a change feasible with current technology Issues of permanence leakage and

Females are at an inherent disadvantage because they can transmit their genes only through ovule production One mechanism by which females can compensate for the loss of male function is by producing more seeds than hermaphrodites As such females should 1 increase resource uptake to support higher seed production and 2 allocate resources saved by the loss of male function to seed production To test this hypothesis we measured physiological and floral traits of gynodioecious Lobelia siphilitica controlling for both environmental and genetic variation through a comparison of siblings females had 14 higher and 32 higher photosynthetic rate than hermaphrodites suggesting that they have increased carbon acquisition by altering photosynthetic physiology Female siphilitica produced flowers with smaller corollas than hermaphrodites all P suggesting that females allocate resources away from floral structures used for pollinator attraction The genetic correlation between genders for four floral and four physiological traits was significantly less than one but greater than zero indicating that the evolution of gender dimorphism in response to selection will be constrained The allocation of resources saved by the loss of male function has been viewed as the most important mechanism allowing females of gynodioecious species to support higher seed production Our data suggest that increased resource acquisition by females at stages can also contribute to the maintenance of gender dimorphism in gynodioecious species View details for DOI View details for Web of Science ID

Jackson Banner Jobbagy Pockman Wall 2002 418 6898 Abstract The invasion of woody vegetation into deserts grasslands and savannas is generally thought to lead to an increase in the amount of carbon stored in those ecosystems For this reason shrub and forest expansion for example into grasslands is also suggested to be a substantial if uncertain component of the terrestrial carbon sink Here we investigate woody plant invasion along a precipitation gradient 200 to mm yr by comparing carbon and nitrogen budgets and soil delta 13 C profiles between six pairs of adjacent grasslands in which one of each pair was invaded by woody species 30 to 100 years ago We found a clear negative relationship between precipitation and changes in soil organic carbon and nitrogen content when grasslands were invaded by woody vegetation with drier sites gaining and wetter sites losing soil organic carbon Losses of soil organic carbon at the wetter sites were substantial enough to offset increases in plant biomass carbon suggesting that current assessments may overestimate carbon sinks Assessments relying on carbon stored from woody plant invasions to balance emissions may therefore be incorrect View

molecular biophysical and ecological research suggests that roots are the weakest link along this hydraulic flow path We attempt here to predict rooting depth and water uptake using the hydraulic properties of plants and the soil and also to suggest how new physiological tools might contribute to studies of hydraulic lift the water balance and interactions View details for Web of Science ID

of a large project to determine rooting depth and resource uptake on the Edwards Plateau of central Texas we developed a technique that allows the parts of all plants to be identified to the level of genus and usually to species Identification is achieved by comparing DNA sequences of the internal transcribed spacer ITS region of the nuclear ribosomal DNA repeat derived from plant material with a reference ITS region database for plants at a site The method works throughout plants because the plant ITS region can be PCR amplified using a set of universal primers Congeneric species can usually be identified because the ITS region evolves relatively rapidly In our study all roots were easily identified to the level of genus most congeneric species were identified solely by ITS sequence differences but some required a combination of ITS sequence data and surveys of species at a site In addition to showing the feasibility and efficacy of our technique we compare it with another technique used to identify plant parts Finally we also describe a DNA extraction and purification technique that reliably provides DNA of sufficient quantity from roots so that PCR can be readily accomplished Our technique should allow the parts of plants in any system to be identified and thereby open new possibilities for the study of plant communities View details for Web of Science ID

biodiversity for the year 2100 can now be developed based on scenarios of changes in atmospheric carbon dioxide climate vegetation and land use and the known sensitivity of biodiversity to these changes This study identified a ranking of the importance of drivers of change a ranking of the biomes with respect to expected changes and the major sources of uncertainties For terrestrial ecosystems change probably will have the largest effect followed by climate change nitrogen deposition biotic exchange and elevated carbon dioxide concentration For freshwater ecosystems biotic exchange is much more important Mediterranean climate and grassland ecosystems likely will experience the greatest proportional change in biodiversity because of the substantial influence of all drivers of biodiversity change Northern temperate ecosystems are estimated to experience the least biodiversity change because major change has already occurred Plausible changes in biodiversity in other biomes depend on interactions among the causes of biodiversity change These interactions represent one of the largest uncertainties in projections of future biodiversity change View details for

PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA Jackson Moore Hoffmann Pockman Linder 1999 96 20 Abstract Belowground vertical community composition and maximum rooting depth of the Edwards Plateau of central Texas were determined by using DNA sequence variation to identify roots from caves m deep Roots from caves were identified by comparing their DNA sequences for the internal transcribed spacer ITS region of the ribosomal DNA repeat against a reference ITS database developed for woody plants of the region Sequencing the ITS provides to our knowledge the first universal method for identifying plant roots At least six tree species in the system grew roots deeper than 5 m but only the evergreen oak Quercus fusiformis was found below 10 The maximum rooting depth for the ecosystem was approximately 25 18 O isotopic signatures for stem water of fusiformis confirmed water uptake from 18 m underground The availability of resources at depth coupled with small surface pools of water and nutrients may explain the occurrence of deep roots in this and other systems View details for Web of Science ID 000082868500085 View details for PubMedID 10500186

biosphere Although leaf area data are an important input to such models and are readily available globally global root distributions for modeling water and nutrient uptake and carbon cycling have not been available This analysis provides global distributions for fine root biomass length and surface area with depth in the soil and global estimates of nutrient pools in fine roots Calculated root surface area is almost always greater than leaf area more than an order of magnitude so in grasslands The average C N P ratio in living fine roots is and global fine root carbon is more than 5 of all

6261 Abstract SOIL microsites rich in available nutrients are an important source of mineral nutrients for plants in many environments Patchiness in nutrient availability below ground is analogous to resource availability in canopy gaps above ground 6 Although the physiological changes occurring in leaves exposed to sun and shade in canopy gaps are well known we do not know any studies that show similar physiological changes in roots in enriched soil patches Here we present evidence of large and rapid increases in the uptake kinetics of plant roots after creating soil patches in the field The mean rate of phosphate uptake at a given external phosphate concentration increased by as much as 80 for roots from enriched soil patches compared with roots of control patches treated with distilled water The changes took place within days of patch treatment This degree of plasticity was particularly notable for plants growing in soils of very low available phosphorus These results showing rapid physiological plasticity of roots in fertile soil microsites have important implications for the theory and modelling of nutrient uptake in all soils View details for Web of Science ID A1990CQ97200059
