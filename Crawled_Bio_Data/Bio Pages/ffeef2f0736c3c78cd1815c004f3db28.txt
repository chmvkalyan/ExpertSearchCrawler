an elected member of the National Academy of Sciences the Institute of Medicine the American Academy of Arts and Sciences the Amerian Philosophical Society and many other societies He is past president of the American Association of Immunologists 1994 and the International Society of Stem Cell Research 2009 Weissman is an expert in the field of hematopoiesis leukemia and hematopoietic stem cells HSC and most recently the clonal events leading from HSC to leukemia stem cells His research also encompasses the phylogeny and developmental biology of the cells that make up the and immune systems He has a laboratory at Hopkins Marine Station of Stanford University where he studies the histocompatibility systems in colonial protochordate a system which he proposed evolved to prevent predatory germline stem cell lineages from passing from one individual to another in colonies that share a common extracorporeal blood vascular system only histocompatible stem cells can colonize allogeneic natural parabionts His laboratory was first to identify and isolate the stem cell HSC from mice and has defined by lineage analysis the stages of development between the stem cells and mature progeny His laboratories have also discovered the human HSC a human stem cell population mouse skeletal muscle stem cells and an osteochondral stem cell in mice He has worked in the area of cancer since 1977 and is a leader in the field of cancer stem cell biology In recent years his work has included studying the potential of CD47 as a cancer therapeutic and identifying cancer stem cells from a variety of blood and solid cancers He and his colleagues have found that CD47 a eat me is highly expressed beginning in the latter stages of progression of cancer stem cells from the benign to the highly malignant state and this counteracts signals on preneoplastic and highly malignant cancer cells presumably as part of the evolution of cancer clones driven by subsets of cells in the cancer This research brings into focus the primary role of phagocytic cells such as macrophages of the innate immune system in tumor surveillance Weissman was a founder of three companies SyStemix Cellerant and Stem Cells all focused on bringing stem cell therapies into the clinic and earlier was on the founding SABs of Amgen DNAX and T Cell Sciences Clinical Trials Microarray Analysis of Gene

Breaking Down the Barriers to Precision Cancer Nanomedicine TRENDS IN BIOTECHNOLOGY von Roemeling Jian Chan Weissman Kim Y 2017 35 2 Abstract Nanomedicine offers unique advantages in treating human cancers However physiological and pathological barriers within normal and disease tissues which are highly variable among individuals often hinder its effectiveness The body possesses specific innate responses to nanoparticles NPs which when combined with unique pathophysiological signatures in the tumor microenvironment can severely limit the utility of nanomedicine in the oncological setting Furthermore with the successes of cancer immunotherapies understanding nanoimmune interactions and developing cancer nanomedicine that can take advantage of the body immune functions will increasingly become clinically relevant Therefore a better understanding of the important native and acquired biological processes that dictate the fate of nanomedicine is integral to developing more effective

Beachy Yang Goodman Weissman Chan Longaker 2017 9 372 Abstract Diabetes mellitus DM is a metabolic disease frequently associated with impaired bone healing Despite its increasing prevalence worldwide the molecular etiology of skeletal complications remains poorly defined Using advanced stem cell characterization techniques we analyzed intrinsic and extrinsic determinants of mouse skeletal stem cell mSSC function to identify specific mSSC abnormalities that could impair skeletal repair in diabetic Db mice We discovered that high serum concentrations of tumor necrosis directly repressed the expression of Indian hedgehog Ihh in mSSCs and in their downstream skeletogenic progenitors in Db mice When hedgehog signaling was inhibited during fracture repair mSSC expansion was suppressed resulting in impaired healing We reversed this deficiency by precise delivery of purified Ihh to the fracture site via a specially formulated hydrogel In the presence of exogenous Ihh the expansion and osteogenic potential of mSSCs were restored culminating in the rescue of Db bone healing Our results present a feasible strategy for precise treatment of molecular aberrations in stem and progenitor cell populations to correct skeletal manifestations of systemic disease View details for DOI View details for PubMedID 28077677 Practical ImmunoPET radiotracer design considerations for human immune checkpoint imaging Journal of nuclear medicine official publication Society of Nuclear Medicine Mayer Natarajan Gordon Maute McCracken Ring Weissman Gambhir 2016 Abstract Immune checkpoint blockade has emerged as a promising cancer treatment paradigm Unfortunately there are still a large number of patients and malignancies that do not respond to therapy A major barrier to validating biomarkers for the prediction and monitoring of responders to clinical checkpoint blockade has been the lack of imaging tools to accurately assess dynamic immune checkpoint expression Here we sought to optimize noninvasive imaging of human programmed 1 expression in a preclinical model using a small engineered protein scaffold Six radiotracer variants were developed and used in preclinical imaging and biodistribution studies to assess their ability to detect human expression in vivo Radiotracer design modifications included chelate glycosylation and radiometal was adopted as the naming convention for aglycosylated tracer variants NOD scid NSG mice were inoculated with subcutaneous tumors engineered to either be constitutively positive CT26 or be negative CT26 for human expression When the tumors had grown to an average size of 1 cm in diameter mice were injected with MBq μg of an engineered radiotracer variant and imaged At 1 h after injection organs were harvested for biodistribution Of the practical tracer modifications considered glycosylation was the most prominent design factor affecting tracer uptake specificity and clearance In imaging studies aglycosylated 64 most accurately visualized human expression in vivo We reasoned that because of the scaffold small size 14 kDa its pharmacokinetics may be suitable for labeling with the and widely clinically available radiometal 68 At 1 h after injection 68 and 68 exhibited promising ratios in ex vivo biodistribution studies and ratios respectively Notably all radiotracer variants enabled much earlier detection of human expression 1 h after injection than previously reported radiolabeled antibodies 24 h after injection This work provides a template for assessing tracer design parameters and supports the translation of small engineered protein radiotracers for imaging human immune checkpoints View details for PubMedID 27980047 Evidence that beta 7 Integrin Regulates Hematopoietic Stem

Cell stem cell Masaki Takahashi Umino Sato Ito Yanagida Nishimura Yamaguchi Hirabayashi Era Loh Wu Weissman Nakauchi 2016 19 5 Abstract Cell types more advanced in development than embryonic stem cells such as EpiSCs fail to contribute to chimeras when injected into blastocysts apparently because the injected cells undergo apoptosis Here we show that transient promotion of cell survival through expression of the gene BCL2 enables EpiSCs and Sox17 endoderm progenitors to integrate into blastocysts and contribute to chimeric embryos Upon injection into blastocyst EpiSCs contributed to all bodily tissues in chimeric animals while Sox17 endoderm progenitors specifically contributed in a fashion to endodermal tissues In addition BCL2 expression enabled rat EpiSCs to contribute to mouse embryonic chimeras thereby forming interspecies chimeras that could survive to adulthood Our system therefore provides a method to overcome cellular compatibility issues that typically restrict chimera formation Application of this type of approach could broaden the use of embryonic chimeras including chimeras for basic developmental biology research and regenerative medicine View details

The hematopoietic stem cell HSC is a multipotent stem cell that resides in the bone marrow and has the ability to form all of the cells of the blood and immune system Since its first purification in 1988 additional studies have refined the phenotype and functionality of HSCs and characterized all of their downstream progeny The hematopoietic lineage is divided into two main branches the myeloid and lymphoid arms The myeloid arm is characterized by the common myeloid progenitor and all of its resulting cell types The stages of hematopoiesis have been defined in both mice and humans During embryological development the earliest hematopoiesis takes place in yolk sac blood islands and then migrates to the fetal liver and hematopoietic organs Some adult myeloid populations develop directly from yolk sac progenitors without apparent bone marrow intermediates such as macrophages Hematopoiesis also changes over time with a bias of the dominating HSCs toward myeloid development as animals age Defects in myelopoiesis contribute to many hematologic disorders and some of these can be overcome with therapies that target the aberrant stage of development Furthermore insights into myeloid development have informed us of mechanisms of programmed cell removal The axis a immune checkpoint limits macrophage removal of HSCs but can be exploited by hematologic and solid malignancies

cure diverse diseases of the blood system including hematologic malignancies anemias and autoimmune disorders However patients must undergo toxic conditioning regimens that use chemotherapy radiation to eliminate host HSCs and enable donor HSC engraftment Previous studies have shown that monoclonal antibodies deplete HSCs from bone marrow niches allowing donor HSC engraftment in immunodeficient mice We show that host HSC clearance is dependent on antibody effector functions and enhancing effector activity through blockade of CD47 a immune checkpoint extends conditioning to fully immunocompetent mice The combined treatment leads to elimination of 99 of host HSCs and robust multilineage blood reconstitution after HSC transplantation This targeted conditioning regimen that uses only biologic agents has the potential to transform the practice of HSC transplantation and enable its use in a wider spectrum of patients View details for DOI View details for PubMedID 27510901 Antibody Therapy Targeting CD47 and CD271 Effectively Suppresses Melanoma Metastasis in Xenografts Cell reports Ngo Han Lakatos Sahoo Hachey Weiskopf Beck Weissman Boiko 2016 16 6 Abstract The high rate of metastasis and recurrence among melanoma patients indicates the existence of cells within melanoma that have the ability to both initiate metastatic programs and bypass immune recognition Here we identify CD47 as a regulator of melanoma tumor metastasis and immune evasion Protein and gene expression analysis of clinical melanoma samples reveals that CD47 an signal correlates with melanoma metastasis blockade of CD47 coupled with targeting of CD271 melanoma cells strongly inhibits tumor metastasis in xenografts This therapeutic effect is mediated by drastic changes in the tumor and metastatic site immune microenvironments both of whichwhich exhibit greatly increased density of differentiated macrophages and significantly fewer inflammatory monocytes macrophages CCR2 and neutrophils all of which are associated with disease progression Thus antibody therapy that activates the innate immune response in combination with selective targeting of CD271 melanoma cells represents a powerful therapeutic approach against metastatic melanoma View details for DOI View details for PubMedID 27477289 antibodies restore phagocytosis and prevent atherosclerosis Nature Kojima

underlies heart attack and stroke Advanced lesions at risk of rupture are characterized by the pathological accumulation of diseased vascular cells and apoptotic cellular debris Why these cells are not cleared remains unknown Here we show that atherogenesis is associated with upregulation of CD47 a key molecule that is known to render malignant cells resistant to programmed cell removal or We find that administration of antibodies reverses this defect in efferocytosis normalizes the clearance of diseased vascular tissue and ameliorates atherosclerosis in multiple mouse models Mechanistic studies implicate the factor as a fundamental driver of impaired programmed cell removal explaining why this process is compromised in vascular disease Similar to recent observations in cancer impaired efferocytosis appears to play a pathogenic role in cardiovascular disease but is not a fixed defect and may represent a novel therapeutic target View details for PubMedID 27437576 Mapping the

Epstein J Kundaje Talbot Beachy Ang Weissman 2016 166 2 Abstract differentiation to desired lineages requires navigating alternating developmental paths that often lead to unwanted cell types Hence comprehensive developmental roadmaps are crucial to channel differentiation toward desired fates To this end here we map bifurcating lineage choices leading from pluripotency to 12 human mesodermal lineages including bone muscle and heart We defined the extrinsic signals controlling each binary lineage decision enabling us to logically block differentiation toward unwanted fates and rapidly steer pluripotent stem cells toward 80 pure human mesodermal lineages at most branchpoints This strategy enabled the generation of human bone and heart progenitors that could engraft in respective in vivo models Mapping stepwise chromatin and gene expression changes in mesoderm development uncovered somite segmentation a previously unobservable human embryonic event transiently marked by HOPX expression Collectively this roadmap enables navigation of mesodermal development to produce transplantable human tissue progenitors and uncover developmental processes VIDEO ABSTRACT View details for

cancer SCLC is a highly aggressive subtype of lung cancer with limited treatment options CD47 is a molecule that promotes immune evasion by engaging protein alpha SIRPα which serves as an inhibitory receptor on macrophages Here we found that CD47 is highly expressed on the surface of human SCLC cells therefore we investigated immunotherapies as a potential approach for SCLC treatment Disruption of the interaction of CD47 with SIRPα using antibodies induced phagocytosis of human SCLC patient cells in culture In a murine model administration of antibodies or targeted inactivation of the Cd47 gene markedly inhibited SCLC tumor growth Furthermore using comprehensive antibody arrays we identified several possible therapeutic targets on the surface of SCLC cells Antibodies to these targets including cell adhesion molecule NCAM promoted phagocytosis in human SCLC cell lines that was enhanced when combined with therapies In light of recent clinical trials for therapies in cancer treatment these findings identify disruption of the axis as a potential immunotherapeutic strategy for SCLC This approach could enable personalized immunotherapeutic regimens in patients with SCLC and other

cytotoxic cells to eliminate histocompatible partners PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA Corey rosental Kowarsky Sinha Ishizuka Palmeri Quake Voskoboynik Weissman 2016 113 23 Abstract In a primitive chordate model of natural chimerism one chimeric partner is often eliminated in a process of allogeneic resorption Here we identify the cellular framework underlying loss of tolerance to one partner within a natural Botryllus schlosseri chimera We show that the principal cell type mediating chimeric partner elimination is a cytotoxic morula cell MC Proinflammatory developmental cell death programs render MCs cytotoxic and in collaboration with activated phagocytes eliminate chimeric partners during the takeover phase of blastogenic development Among these genes the proinflammatory cytokine enhances cytotoxicity in allorecognition assays Cellular transfer of MCs from allogeneic donors into recipients shows that the resorption response can be adoptively acquired Transfer of 1 10 5 allogeneic MCs eliminated 33 of 78 42 recipient primary buds and 20 of 76 adult parental adult organisms zooids by 14 d whereas transfer of allogeneic cell populations lacking MCs had only minimal effects on recipient colonies Furthermore reactivity of transferred cells coincided with the onset of cell death programs and disproportionately affected developing tissues within a chimera Among chimeric partner losers severe developmental defects were observed in asexually propagating tissues reflecting a pathologic switch in gene expression in developmental programs These studies provide evidence that elimination of one partner in a chimera is an immune rejection that operates within histocompatible pairs and that maximal allogeneic responses involve the coordination of both phagocytic programs and the arming of cytotoxic cells View details for DOI View details for Web of Science ID 000377155400052 View details for PubMedID

a type of pancreatic cancer with limited therapeutic options Consequently most patients with advanced disease die from tumor progression Current evidence indicates that a subset of cancer cells is responsible for tumor development metastasis and recurrence and targeting these cells is necessary to eradicate tumors However cells and the biological processes that promote pathogenesis remain largely uncharacterized in PanNETs Here we profile primary and metastatic tumors from an index patient and demonstrate that MET activation is important for tumor growth in PanNET xenograft models We identify a highly tumorigenic cell population within several independent surgically acquired PanNETs characterized by increased protein CD90 expression and aldehyde dehydrogenase A1 ALDHA1 activity and provide in vitro and in vivo evidence for their properties We performed proteomic profiling of 332 antigens in two cell lines and four primary tumors and showed that CD47 a protein that acts as a do eat me signal by cancers to evade innate immune surveillance is ubiquitously expressed Moreover CD47 coexpresses with MET and is enriched in CD90 hi cells Furthermore blocking CD47 signaling

potential therapeutic target TAMs display a continuum of different polarization states between antitumorigenic M1 and protumorigenic M2 phenotypes with a lower ratio correlating with worse prognosis Here we investigated the effect of macrophage polarization on phagocytosis of human glioblastoma cells in vitro as well as the effect of on the distribution of M1 versus M2 macrophages within human glioblastoma cells grown in mouse xenografts Bone mouse macrophages and peripheral human macrophages were polarized in vitro toward M1 or M2 phenotypes and verified by flow cytometry Primary human glioblastoma cell lines were offered as targets to mouse and human M1 or M2 polarized macrophages in vitro The addition of an monoclonal antibody led to enhanced phagocytosis by mouse and human M1 and M2 macrophages In both cases the phagocytosis by M1 was more prominent than that for M2 Dissected tumors from human glioblastoma xenografted within mice and treated with showed a significant increase of M1 macrophages within the tumor These data show that treatment leads to enhanced tumor cell phagocytosis by both M1 and M2 macrophage subtypes with a higher phagocytosis rate by M1 macrophages Furthermore these data demonstrate that treatment alone can shift the phenotype of macrophages toward the M1 subtype in vivo View details for DOI View details for Web of Science ID 000374541200027

immunostaining of microglia in histological sections in healthy and diseased brains as well as isolation of pure nonactivated microglia by FACS Using our antibodies we provide to our knowledge the first RNAseq profiles of highly pure mouse microglia during development and after an immune challenge We used these to demonstrate that mouse microglia mature by the second postnatal week and to

marker system to trace clonality within the tumor microenvironment to show that tumor blood vessels follow a pattern of dynamic clonal evolution In an advanced melanoma tumor microenvironment the vast majority of tumor vasculature clones are derived from a common precursor Quantitative lineage analysis reveals founder clones diminish in frequency and are replaced by subclones as tumors evolve These blood vessels are characterized by a developmental switch to a more invasive and immunologically silent phenotype Gene expression profiling and pathway analysis reveals selection for traits promoting upregulation of alternative angiogenic programs such as unregulated signaling and enhanced autocrine signaling through VEGF and PDGF Furthermore we show a developmental switch in the expression of functionally significant primary lymphocyte adhesion molecules on tumor endothelium such as the loss in expression of the mucosal addressin whose counter receptor a4β7 on lymphocytes controls lymphocyte homing Changes in adhesive properties on tumor endothelial subclones are accompanied by decreases in expression of lymphocyte chemokines CXCL16 CXCL13 CXCL12 CXCL9 CXCL10 and CCL19 These evolutionary patterns in the expressed genetic program within tumor endothelium will have both a quantitative and functional impact on lymphocyte distribution that may well influence tumor immune function and underlie escape mechanisms from current antiangiogenic pharmacotherapies Cancer Res 76 6 AACR View details for DOI View details for PubMedID 26719541 View details for PubMedCentralID

NHLBI and incorporates contributions by the participants as well as other thought leaders subsequently consulted who together represent research fields relevant to all branches of the NIH The group was deliberately composed not only of individuals with a current research emphasis in the glycosciences but also of many experts from other fields who evinced a strong interest in being involved in the discussions The original goal was to discuss the value of creating centers of excellence for training the next generation of biomedical investigators in the glycosciences A broader theme that emerged was the urgent need to bring the glycosciences back into the mainstream of biology by integrating relevant education into the curricula of medical graduate and postgraduate training programs thus generating a critical sustainable workforce that can advance the translation of glycosciences into a more complete understanding of biology and the enhanced practice of medicine View details for

paradigm in skeletal regenerative medicine However the primary means by which transplanted cells contribute to bone repair and regeneration remain controversial To gain an insight into the mechanisms of how both transplanted and endogenous cells mediate skeletal healing we used a transgenic mouse strain expressing both the topaz variant of green fluorescent protein under the control of the collagen type I alpha 1 sequence Col1a1 GFP and tomato red fluorescent protein constitutively in all cell types R26 mTmG A comparison of healing in parietal versus frontal calvarial defects in these mice revealed that frontal osteoblasts express Col1a1 to a greater degree than parietal osteoblasts Furthermore the application of stromal cells ASCs bone mesenchymal stem cells and osteoblasts derived from these mice to calvarial defects allowed for investigation of cell survival and function following transplantation We found that ASCs led to significantly faster rates of bone healing in comparison to and osteoblasts ASCs displayed both increased survival and increased Col1a1 expression compared to and osteoblasts following calvarial defect transplantation which may explain their superior regenerative capacity in the context of bone healing Using this novel reporter system we were able to elucidate how therapies impact bone healing and identify ASCs as an attractive candidate

in cancer development PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA Weissman 2015 112 29 Abstract It is obvious that natural selection operates at the level of individuals and collections of individuals Nearly two decades ago we showed that in colonies of protochordate colonial tunicates sharing a blood circulation there exists an exchange of somatic stem cells and germline stem cells resulting in somatic chimeras and stem cell competitions for gonadal niches Stem cells are unlike other cells in the body in that they alone so that they form clones that are perpetuated for the life of the organism Stem cell competitions have allowed the emergence of competitive somatic and germline stem cell clones Highly successful germline stem cells usually outcompete less successful competitors both in the gonads of the genotype partner from which they arise and in the gonads of the natural parabiotic partners Therefore natural selection also operates at the level of germline stem cell clones In the colonial tunicate Botryllus schlosseri the formation of natural parabionts is prevented by a highly polymorphic histocompatibility gene called Botryllus histocompatibility factor This limits germline stem cell predation to kin as the locus has hundreds of alleles We show that in mice germline stem cells compete for gonad niches and in mice and humans stem cells also compete for bone marrow niches We show that the clonal progression from stem cells to acute leukemias by successive genetic and epigenetic events in blood stem cells also involves competition and selection between clones and propose that this is a general theme in cancer View details for DOI View details for Web of Science ID 000358225100052 View details for PubMedID

Garcia 2015 290 20 Abstract CD47 is a cell surface protein that transmits an signal known as the signal to macrophages upon engaging its receptor signal regulatory protein α SIRPα Molecules that antagonize the interaction by binding to CD47 such as antibodies and the engineered SIRPα variant CV1 have been shown to facilitate responses However these strategies targeting CD47 are handicapped by large antigen sinks in vivo and indiscriminate cell binding due to ubiquitous expression of CD47 These factors reduce bioavailability and increase the risk of toxicity Here we present an alternative strategy to antagonize the pathway by engineering high affinity CD47 variants that target SIRPα which has restricted tissue expression CD47 proved to be refractive to conventional affinity maturation techniques targeting its binding interface with SIRPα Therefore we developed a novel engineering approach whereby we augmented the existing contact interface via peptide extension coined Velcro engineering The high affinity variant bound to the two most prominent human SIRPα alleles with greatly increased affinity relative to CD47 and potently antagonized CD47 binding to SIRPα on human macrophages synergizes with monoclonal antibodies to enhance macrophage phagocytosis of tumor cells in vitro with similar potency as CV1 Finally interacts specifically with a subset of cells in human blood whereas CV1 binds all myeloid lymphoid and erythroid populations interrogated This is consistent with the restricted expression of SIRPα compared with CD47 Herein we have demonstrated that

consistently associated with promoting tumor progression and poor patient outcomes However many aspects behind the mechanisms that establish this inflammatory microenvironment remain undefined Using bladder cancer BC as a model we found that cancer cells express higher levels of numerous inflammation mediators and form larger tumors compared with cells CD14 antigen is a GPI glycoprotein and has been shown to be critically important in the signaling pathways of receptor TLR CD14 expression in this BC subpopulation of cancer cells is required for increased cytokine production and increased tumor growth Furthermore tumors formed by cells are more highly vascularized with higher myeloid cell infiltration Inflammatory factors produced by BC cells recruit and polarize monocytes and macrophages to acquire characteristics In contrast BC cells have a higher baseline cell division rate than cells Importantly cells produce factors that further increase the proliferation of cells

tune signaling output We utilized diabodies DA as surrogate ligands in a prototypical dimeric system the cytokine Erythropoietin EPO and its receptor EpoR to dimerize EpoR ectodomains in architectures signaling amplitudes varied from full to minimal agonism and structures of these complexes differed in EpoR dimer orientation and proximity Diabodies also elicited biased or differential activation of signaling pathways and gene expression profiles compared to EPO diabodies inhibited proliferation of erythroid precursors from patients with a myeloproliferative neoplasm due to a constitutively

for cancer mAbs Weiskopf Weissman 2015 7 2 Abstract Macrophages are innate immune cells that derive from circulating monocytes reside in all tissues and participate in many states of pathology Macrophages play a dichotomous role in cancer where they promote tumor growth but also serve as critical immune effectors of therapeutic antibodies Macrophages express all classes of Fcγ receptors and they have immense potential to destroy tumors via the process of phagocytosis A number of studies have demonstrated that macrophage phagocytosis is a major mechanism of action of many antibodies approved to treat cancer Consequently a number of approaches to augment macrophage responses to therapeutic antibodies are under investigation including the exploration of new targets and development of antibodies with enhanced functions For example the interaction of CD47 with protein α SIRPα serves as a immune checkpoint that limits the response of macrophages to antibody therapies and agents overcome this barrier to augment phagocytosis The response of macrophages to antibody therapies can also be enhanced with engineered Fc variants bispecific antibodies or conjugates Macrophages have

Although in utero hematopoietic cell transplantation is a promising strategy to treat congenital hematopoietic disorders levels of engraftment have not been therapeutic for diseases in which donor cells have no survival advantage We used an antibody against the murine receptor ACK2 to deplete fetal host hematopoietic stem cells HSCs and increase space within the hematopoietic niche for donor cell engraftment Fetal mice were injected with ACK2 on embryonic days to and surviving pups were transplanted with congenic hematopoietic cells on day of life 1 ACK2 treatment effectively depleted HSCs within the bone marrow with minimal toxicity and the antibody was cleared from the serum before the neonatal transplantation Chimerism levels were significantly higher in treated pups than in controls both myeloid and lymphoid cell chimerism increased because of higher engraftment of HSCs in the bone marrow To test the strategy of repeated HSC depletion and transplantation some mice were treated with ACK2 postnatally but the increase in engraftment was lower than that seen with prenatal treatment We demonstrate a successful fetal conditioning strategy associated with minimal toxicity

turnover replacement and cellular differentiation from presumed tissue cells within hind limb tissues remain largely intact independent of nerve and factors However regenerated digit tips in the absence of nerves displayed patterning defects in bone and nail matrix These phenotypes mimic clinical observations of patients with nerve damage resulting from spinal cord injury and are of

Hematopoietic Stem Cells Accumulate DNA Damage during Aging that Is Repaired upon Entry into Cell Cycle Cell stem cell Beerman Seita Inlay Weissman Rossi J 2014 15 1 Abstract Hematopoietic stem cells HSCs maintain homeostasis and regenerate the blood system throughout life It has been postulated that HSCs may be uniquely capable of preserving their genomic integrity in order to ensure lifelong function To directly test this we quantified DNA damage in HSCs and downstream progenitors from young and old mice revealing that strand breaks significantly accrue in HSCs during aging DNA damage accumulation in HSCs was associated with broad attenuation of DNA repair and response pathways that was dependent upon HSC quiescence Accordingly cycling fetal HSCs and adult HSCs driven into cycle upregulated these pathways leading to repair of strand breaks Our results demonstrate that HSCs are not comprehensively during aging Rather HSC quiescence and concomitant attenuation of DNA repair and response pathways underlies DNA damage accumulation in HSCs during aging These results provide a potential mechanism through which premalignant mutations accrue in HSCs View details for DOI View

The mechanism and magnitude by which the mammalian kidney generates and maintains its proximal tubules distal tubules and collecting ducts remain controversial Here we use in vivo genetic lineage tracing and clonal analysis of individual cells from kidneys undergoing development maintenance and regeneration We show that the adult mammalian kidney undergoes continuous tubulogenesis via expansions of clones Kidneys recovering from damage undergo tubulogenesis through expansions of clones with borders and renal spheres developing in vitro from individual cells maintain distinct fates Analysis of mice derived by transfer of embryonic stem cells ESCs into uncolored blastocysts demonstrates that nephrons are polyclonal developing from expansions of singly fated clones Finally we show that adult renal clones are derived from precursors and their tracing in vivo generates tubules that are segment specific Collectively these analyses demonstrate that precursors functioning as

arise Whereas and engraftability have previously been examined in the embryo multipotency has not been thoroughly addressed especially at the level or within populations To identify when and where clonal multilineage potential arises during embryogenesis we developed a multipotency assay We find that during the initiation of definitive hematopoiesis in the embryo a defined population of multipotent engraftable progenitors emerges that is much more abundant within the yolk sac YS than the AGM or fetal liver These experiments indicate that multipotent cells appear in concert within

sequential acquisition of genetic lesions in a single lineage of cells Our previous studies have shown that in acute myeloid leukemia AML mutation acquisition occurs in functionally normal hematopoietic stem cells HSCs These preleukemic HSCs harbor some but not all of the mutations found in the leukemic cells We report here the identification of patterns of mutation acquisition in human AML Our findings support a model in which mutations in landscaping genes involved in global chromatin changes such as DNA methylation histone modification and chromatin looping occur early in the evolution of AML whereas mutations in proliferative genes occur late Additionally we analyze the persistence of preleukemic mutations in patients in remission and find progenitor cells and various mature cells that harbor preleukemic mutations These findings indicate that preleukemic HSCs can survive induction chemotherapy identifying these cells as a reservoir for the reevolution of relapsed disease Finally through the study of several cases of relapsed AML we demonstrate various evolutionary patterns for the generation of relapsed disease and show that some of these patterns are consistent with involvement of preleukemic HSCs These findings provide key insights into the monitoring of minimal residual disease and the identification of therapeutic targets in human AML View

vessel formation by secreting various angiogenic factors Given that factor HIF is a critical regulator for angiogenesis we questioned whether HIF in myeloid cells also plays a role in promoting angiogenesis To address this question we generated a unique strain of knockout mice targeting HIF pathways using human S100A8 as a promoter We observed that mutant mice where is transcriptionally activated in myeloid cells by deletion of the von gene resulted in erythema enhanced neovascularization in matrigel plugs and increased production of vascular endothelial growth factor VEGF in the

driving neovascularization in matrigel Moreover by using a mouse model of hindlimb ischemia we observed significantly improved blood flow in mice intramuscularly injected with monocytes This study

from the lineage of the bone marrow Their unique ability to resorb both the organic and inorganic matrices of bone means that they play a key role in regulating skeletal remodeling Together osteoblasts and osteoclasts are responsible for the dynamic coupling process that involves both bone resorption and bone formation acting together to maintain the normal skeleton during health and disease As the principal cell in the body changes in osteoclast differentiation or function can result in profound effects in the body Diseases associated with altered osteoclast function can range in severity from lethal neonatal disease due to failure to form a marrow space for hematopoiesis to more commonly observed pathologies such as osteoporosis in which excessive osteoclastic bone resorption predisposes to fracture formation An ability to isolate osteoclasts in high numbers in vitro has allowed for significant advances in the understanding of the bone remodeling cycle and has paved the way for the discovery of novel therapeutic strategies that combat these diseases Here we describe a protocol to isolate and cultivate osteoclasts from mouse bone marrow that will yield large numbers

Abstract Mobilization of the response against cancer has the potential to achieve cures However it is not known how to harness cells optimally to achieve an effective antitumor response In this study we show that phagocytosis of cancer by macrophages can initiate an antitumor immune response Using the ovalbumin model antigen system phagocytosis of cancer cells by macrophages resulted in increased

the gastrointestinal tract and arises from the interstitial cells of Cajal It is characterized by expression of the receptor tyrosine kinase CD117 KIT In of GIST cases oncogenic mutations in KIT are present leading to constitutive activation of the receptor which drives the proliferation of these tumors Treatment of GIST with imatinib a tyrosine kinase inhibitor inhibits signaling and initially results in disease control in of patients with GIST However the vast majority of patients eventually develop resistance to imatinib treatment leading to disease progression and posing a significant challenge in the clinical management of these tumors Here we show that an monoclonal antibody mAb SR1 is able to slow the growth of three human GIST cell lines in vitro Importantly these reductions in cell growth were equivalent between and GIST cell lines Treatment of GIST cell lines with SR1 reduces KIT expression suggesting that KIT may be a mechanism by which SR1 inhibits GIST growth Furthermore we also show that SR1 treatment enhances phagocytosis of GIST cells by macrophages indicating that treatment with SR1 may enhance immune tumor clearance Finally using two

Hematopoietic stem cell and progenitor cell mechanisms in myelodysplastic syndromes PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA Pang Pluvinage Price Sridhar Arber

HSCs and myeloid progenitors in MDS have not been extensively characterized We transplanted purified human HSCs from MDS samples into immunodeficient mice and show that HSCs are the cells in MDS We identify a recurrent loss of progenitors GMPs in the bone marrow of low risk MDS patients that can distinguish low risk MDS from clinical mimics thus providing a simple diagnostic tool The loss of GMPs is likely due to increased apoptosis and increased phagocytosis the latter due to the of cell surface calreticulin a prophagocytic marker Blocking calreticulin on low risk MDS myeloid progenitors rescues them from phagocytosis in vitro However in the refractory anemia with excess blasts RAEB stages of MDS the GMP population is increased in frequency compared with normal and myeloid progenitors evade phagocytosis due to of CD47 an antiphagocytic marker Blocking CD47 leads to the selective phagocytosis of this population We propose that MDS HSCs compete with normal HSCs in the patients by increasing their frequency at the expense of normal hematopoiesis that the loss of MDS myeloid progenitors by programmed cell death and programmed cell removal are in part responsible for the cytopenias and that of the do eat me signal CD47 on MDS myeloid progenitors is an important transition step leading from low risk MDS to high risk MDS and possibly to acute myeloid leukemia View

potential to develop into any cell type makes human pluripotent stem cells hPSCs one of the most promising sources for regenerative treatments Hurdles to their clinical applications include 1 formation of heterogeneously differentiated cultures 2 the risk of teratoma formation from residual undifferentiated cells and 3 immune rejection of engrafted cells The recent production of human isogenic genetically identical induced PSCs hiPSCs has been proposed as a solution to the histocompatibility barrier In theory differentiated cells derived from hiPSC lines should be histocompatible to their However propagation maintenance and differentiation of hPSCs in vitro may produce other likely less powerful immune responses In light of recent progress towards the clinical application of hPSCs this review focuses on two antigen presentation phenomena that may lead to rejection of isogenic hPSC derivates namely the expression of aberrant antigens as a result of in vitro maintenance

Karten Chan Nakauchi Weissman 2013 1 2 Abstract Very small stem cells VSELs isolated from bone marrow BM have been reported to be pluripotent Given their nonembryonic source they could replace embryonic stem cells in research and medicine However their potential has been incompletely studied Here we show that we can not find VSELs in mouse BM with any of the reported stem cell potentials specifically for hematopoiesis We found that 1 most events within the VSEL gate had little DNA and the cells corresponding to these events 2 could not form spheres 3 did not express Oct4 and 4 could

Corey Penland White Weissman Quake 2013 2 Abstract Botryllus schlosseri is a colonial urochordate that follows the chordate plan of development following sexual reproduction but invokes a stem budding program during subsequent rounds of asexual reproduction As urochordates are considered to be the closest living invertebrate relatives of vertebrates they are ideal subjects for whole genome sequence analyses Using a novel method for sequencing of eukaryotic genomes we sequenced and assembled 580 Mbp of the schlosseri genome The genome assembly is comprised of nearly predicted genes and predicted genes 40 of which could be confidently parceled into 13 of 16 haploid chromosomes A comparison of homologous genes between schlosseri and other diverse taxonomic groups revealed genomic events

Grova Connolly Wu Gurtner Weissman Wan Longaker 2012 109 50 Abstract Pluripotent cells represent a powerful tool for tissue regeneration but their clinical utility is limited by their propensity to form teratomas Little is known about their interaction with the surrounding niche following implantation and how this may be applied to promote survival and functional engraftment In this study we evaluated the ability of an osteogenic microniche consisting of a bone morphogenetic acid scaffold placed within the context of a macroenvironmental skeletal defect to guide in vivo differentiation of both embryonic and induced pluripotent stem cells In this setting we found de novo bone formation and participation by implanted cells in skeletal regeneration without the formation of a teratoma This finding suggests that local cues from both the implanted and surrounding macroniche may act in concert to promote cellular survival and the in vivo acquisition of a terminal cell fate thereby allowing for functional engraftment of pluripotent cells into regenerating tissue View details for DOI View details for PubMedID 23169671 Identification and prospective isolation of a mesothelial precursor lineage giving rise to smooth muscle cells and fibroblasts for mammalian internal organs and their vasculature NATURE CELL BIOLOGY Rinkevich Mori Sahoo Xu Bermingham Weissman 2012 14 12 Abstract Fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells FSMCs are principal cell types of connective and adventitial tissues that participate in the development physiology and pathology of internal organs with incompletely defined cellular origins Here we identify and prospectively isolate from the mesothelium a mouse cell lineage that is committed to FSMCs The mesothelium is an epithelial monolayer covering the vertebrate thoracic and abdominal cavities and internal organs imaging and transplantation experiments reveal robust generation of FSMCs from the mesothelium By targeting mesothelin MSLN a surface marker expressed on mesothelial cells we identify and isolate precursors capable of clonally generating FSMCs Using a genetic lineage tracing approach we show that embryonic and adult mesothelium represents a common lineage to trunk FSMCs and trunk vasculature with minimal contributions from neural crest or circulating cells The isolation of FSMC precursors enables the examination of multiple aspects of smooth muscle and fibroblast biology as well as the prospective isolation of these precursors for potential regenerative medicine purposes View details for DOI View details for

Multiple myeloma is a hematological neoplasm characterized by the accumulation of clonal plasma cells in the bone marrow Its frequent relapse following achievement of clinical remissions implicates the existence of cells To date results on the identity of cells have differed Here we prospectively identified a population by fractionating and transplanting patient bone marrow cells into human immunocompromised mice Xenotransplantation of fractionated CD138 high cells from 40 of patients led to a repopulation of CD19 CD38 low or CD138 CD38 cells in human bone grafts and these grafts were clonally derived from patient myeloma cells Meanwhile CD19 CD38 low xenografts were detected in human mice transplanted with CD19 CD38 B cells from 8 of 22 samples but were not clonally related to patient myeloma cells Further fractionation and xenotransplantation of CD138 CD38 high cells demonstrated that CD45 or CD19 CD38 high plasma cells but not CD45 high or CD19 CD38 high plasmablasts

antibodies promote phagocytosis and inhibit the growth of human myeloma cells LEUKEMIA Kim Wang Willingham Martin Wernig Weissman 2012 26 12 Abstract Multiple myeloma is a plasma cell neoplasm residing in bone marrow Despite advances in myeloma therapies novel therapies are required to improve patient outcomes CD47 is highly expressed on myeloma cells and a potential therapeutic candidate for myeloma therapies Flow cytometric analysis of patient bone marrow cells revealed that myeloma cells overexpress CD47 when compared with cells in 73 of patients CD47 expression protects cells from phagocytosis by transmitting an inhibitory signal to macrophages Here we show that blocking CD47 with an monoclonal antibody increased phagocytosis of myeloma cells in vitro In xenotransplantation models antibodies inhibited the growth of RPMI 8226 myeloma cells and led to tumor regression mice implicating the eradication of cells Moreover antibodies retarded the growth of patient myeloma cells and alleviated bone resorption in human mice Irradiation of mice before myeloma cell xenotransplantation abolished the therapeutic efficacy of antibodies delivered 2 weeks after radiation and coincided with a reduction of myelomonocytic cells in spleen bone marrow and liver These results are consistent with the hypothesis that blocking antibodies inhibit myeloma growth in part by

Poorly regulated tissue remodeling results in increased breast cancer risk yet how breast cancer stem cells CSC participate in remodeling is unknown We performed in vivo imaging of changes in fluorescent endogenous duct architecture as a metric for remodeling First we quantitatively imaged physiologic remodeling of primary branches of the developing and regenerating mammary tree To assess remodeling events we isolated CSC from mouse mammary tumor virus repeat enhancer driving Wnt1 oncogene breast tumors a well studied model in which tissue remodeling affects tumorigenesis We confirm that CSC drive tumorigenesis suggesting a link between CSC and remodeling We find that normal regenerating and developing gland maintain a specific branching pattern In contrast transplantation of CSC

generates an equilibrium of distinct progenitors NATURE COMMUNICATIONS Blauwkamp Nigam Ardehali Weissman Nusse 2012 3 Abstract The pluripotent nature of human embryonic stem cells hESCs makes them convenient for deriving therapeutically relevant cells Here we show using Wnt reporter hESC lines that the cells are heterogeneous with respect to endogenous Wnt signalling activity Moreover the level of Wnt signalling activity in individual cells correlates with differences in clonogenic potential and differentiation propensity The addition of Wnt protein or conversely a Wnt inhibitor IWP2 reduces heterogeneity allowing stable expansion of Wnt high or Wnt low hESC populations respectively On differentiation the Wnt high hESCs predominantly form endodermal and cardiac cells whereas the Wnt low hESCs generate primarily neuroectodermal cells Thus heterogeneity with respect to endogenous Wnt signalling underlies much of the inefficiency in directing hESCs towards specific cell types The relatively uniform differentiation potential of the Wnt high and Wnt low hESCs leads to faster and more efficient derivation of targeted cell types from these populations View details for DOI View

mutations in a single clonal lineage has been difficult to explain We propose that serial acquisition of mutations occurs in hematopoietic stem cells HSCs We investigated this model through genomic analysis of HSCs from six patients with de novo acute myeloid leukemia AML Using exome sequencing we identified mutations present in individual AML patients harboring the internal tandem duplication mutation We then screened the residual HSCs and detected some of these mutations including mutations in the NPM1 TET2 and SMC1A genes Finally through analysis we determined that a clonal progression of multiple mutations occurred in the HSCs of some AML patients These preleukemic HSCs suggest the clonal evolution of AML genomes from founder mutations revealing a potential mechanism contributing to relapse Such preleukemic HSCs may constitute a cellular reservoir that should be targeted therapeutically for more durable remissions View details for DOI View details for Web of Science ID

Analysis of patient tumor and matched adjacent normal nontumor tissue revealed that CD47 is overexpressed on cancer cells CD47 mRNA expression levels correlated with a decreased probability of survival for multiple types of cancer CD47 is a ligand for SIRPα a protein expressed on macrophages and dendritic cells In vitro blockade of CD47 signaling using targeted monoclonal antibodies enabled macrophage phagocytosis of tumor cells that were otherwise protected Administration of antibodies inhibited tumor growth in orthotopic immunodeficient mouse xenotransplantation models established with patient tumor cells and increased the survival of the mice over time antibody therapy initiated on larger tumors inhibited tumor growth and prevented or treated metastasis but initiation of the therapy on smaller tumors was potentially curative The safety and efficacy of targeting CD47 was further tested and validated in immune competent hosts using an orthotopic mouse breast cancer model These results suggest all human solid tumor cells require CD47 expression to suppress phagocytic innate immune surveillance and elimination These data taken together with similar findings with other human neoplasms show that CD47 is a commonly expressed molecule on all cancers its function to block phagocytosis is known and blockade of its function leads to tumor cell phagocytosis and elimination

2012 109 17 Abstract Antibodies against CD47 which block tumor cell CD47 interactions with macrophage signal regulatory have been shown to decrease tumor size in hematological and epithelial tumor models by interfering with the protection from phagocytosis by macrophages that intact CD47 bestows upon tumor cells Leiomyosarcoma LMS is a tumor of smooth muscle that can express varying levels of CSF1 the expression of which correlates with the numbers of macrophages TAMs that are found in these tumors We have previously shown that the presence of TAMs in LMS is associated with poor clinical outcome and the overall effect of TAMs in LMS therefore appears to be protumorigenic However the use of inhibitory antibodies against CD47 offers an opportunity to turn TAMs against LMS cells by allowing the phagocytic behavior of resident macrophages to predominate Here we show that interference with CD47 increases phagocytosis of two human LMS cell lines LMS04 and LMS05 in vitro In addition treatment of mice bearing subcutaneous LMS04 and LMS05 tumors with a novel humanized antibody resulted in significant reductions in tumor size Mice bearing LMS04 tumors develop large numbers of lymph node and lung metastases In a unique model for neoadjuvant treatment mice were treated with antibody starting 1 wk before resection of established primary tumors and subsequently showed a striking decrease in the size and number of metastases These data suggest that treatment with antibodies not only reduces primary tumor size but can also be used to inhibit the development of or to eliminate

rescued by increasing the amount of ubiquitin However it is still not known why Ubc is required for fetal liver development and the nature of the defective cell types responsible for embryonic lethality have not been characterized In this study we assessed the cause of embryonic lethality with respect to the fetal liver hematopoietic system We found that Ubc was highly expressed in the embryonic liver and the proliferation capacity of fetal liver cells was reduced in Ubc embryos Specifically Ubc was most highly expressed in hematopoietic cells and the proliferation capacity of hematopoietic cells was significantly impaired in Ubc embryos While hematopoietic cell and hematopoietic stem cell HSC frequency was maintained in Ubc embryos the absolute number of these cells was diminished because of reduced total liver cell number in Ubc embryos Transplantations of fetal liver cells into lethally irradiated recipient mice by and competitive reconstitution methods indicated that disruption of Ubc does not significantly impair the intrinsic function of fetal liver HSCs These findings suggest that disruption of Ubc reduces the absolute number of HSCs in embryonic livers but has no significant effect on the autonomous function of HSCs Thus the lethality of Ubc embryos is not the result of intrinsic HSC failure View details for DOI View details for Web of Science ID

provide mechanistic insight we assessed relative tumorigenicity and differentiation potential via xenotransplantation We then correlated the prognostic utility of the identified markers to outcomes within gene expression and FFPE tissue datasets Our data indicate that BC can be subclassified into three subtypes on the basis of their differentiation states basal intermediate and differentiated where only the most primitive tumor cell subpopulation within each subtype is capable of generating xenograft tumors and recapitulating downstream populations We found that keratin 14 KRT14 marks the most primitive differentiation state that precedes KRT5 and KRT20 expression Furthermore KRT14 expression is consistently associated with worse prognosis in both univariate and multivariate analyses

Pang Price Sahoo Beerman Maloney Rossi Schrier Weissman 2011 108 50 Abstract In the human hematopoietic system aging is associated with decreased bone marrow cellularity decreased adaptive immune system function and increased incidence of anemia and other hematological disorders and malignancies Recent studies in mice suggest that changes within the hematopoietic stem cell HSC population during aging contribute significantly to the manifestation of these hematopoietic pathologies Though the mouse HSC population has been shown to change both quantitatively and functionally with age changes in the human HSC and progenitor cell populations during aging have been incompletely characterized To elucidate the properties of an aged human hematopoietic system that may predispose to hematopoietic dysfunction we evaluated immunophenotypic HSC and other hematopoietic progenitor populations from healthy hematologically normal young and elderly human bone marrow samples We found that aged immunophenotypic human HSC increase in frequency are less quiescent and exhibit differentiation potential compared with young HSC Gene expression profiling revealed that aged immunophenotypic human HSC transcriptionally genes associated with cell cycle myeloid lineage specification and myeloid malignancies These alterations in the frequency developmental potential and gene expression profile of human HSC are similar to those changes observed in mouse HSC suggesting that hematopoietic aging is an evolutionarily conserved process View details for DOI View details for Web of Science

ability to eliminate infected and malignant cells yet the cellular stages of NK lineage commitment and maturation are incompletely understood Using flow cytometry we identified a novel progenitor that is a developmental intermediate between the upstream common lymphoid progenitor and the downstream NKP previously assumed to represent the first stage of NK lineage commitment Our analysis also refined the purity of NKPs rNKP by such that 50 of both and rNKP cells gave rise to NK cells at the level On transplantation into unconditioned recipients both and rNKPs generated mature NK cells expressing a repertoire of Ly49 family members that degranulated on stimulation ex vivo Intrathymic injection of these progenitors however yielded no NK cells suggesting a separate origin of thymic NK cells Unlike the rNKP the does not express CD122 yet it is lineage committed toward the NK cell fate adding support to the theory that signaling is not required for NK commitment Taken together our

lymphoma NHL presents as both localized and disseminated disease with spread to secondary sites carrying a worse prognosis Although pathways driving NHL dissemination have been identified there are few therapies capable of inhibiting them Here we report a novel role for the immunomodulatory protein CD47 in NHL dissemination and we demonstrate that therapeutic targeting of CD47 can prevent such spread We developed 2 in vivo lymphoma metastasis models using Raji cells a human NHL cell line and primary cells from a lymphoma patient CD47 expression was required for Raji cell dissemination to the liver in mouse xenotransplants Targeting of CD47 with a blocking antibody inhibited Raji cell dissemination to major organs including the central nervous system and inhibited hematogenous dissemination of primary lymphoma cells We hypothesized that elimination of circulating tumor cells occurred through phagocytosis a previously described mechanism for blocking antibodies As predicted inhibition of dissemination by antibodies was dependent on blockade of phagocyte SIRPα and required macrophage effector cells These results demonstrate that CD47 is required for NHL dissemination which can be therapeutically targeted with a blocking antibody Ultimately these findings are potentially applicable to the dissemination and metastasis of other solid tumors View details for DOI View

Embryonic stem cells ESCs have shown the potential to restore cardiac function after myocardial injury Superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles SPIO have been widely employed to label ESCs for cellular MRI However nonspecific intracellular accumulation of SPIO limits in vivo assessment of the transplanted cells To overcome this limitation a novel reporter gene RG has been developed to express antigens on the ESC surface By employing monoclonal antibody against these antigens the viability of transplanted ESCs can be detected in vivo This study aims to develop a new molecular MRI method to assess in vivo ESC viability proliferation and teratoma formation The RG is designed to express 2 antigens hemagglutinin A and myc and luciferase on the ESC surface The two antigens serve as the molecular targets for The human and mouse ESCs were transduced with the RG and transplanted into the area using the murine myocardial injury model In vivo MRI was performed following serial intravenous administration of Significant hypointense signal was generated from the viable and proliferating ESCs and subsequent teratoma This novel molecular MRI technique enabled in vivo detection

tight regulation of both and differentiation to maintain homeostasis of the hematopoietic system as well as to avoid aberrations in growth that may result in leukemias or other disorders In this study we sought to understand the molecular basis of lineage determination with particular focus on factors that influence commitment in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells We used intracellular flow cytometry to identify two novel hematopoietic progenitor populations within the mouse cKit Lineage Sca1 KLS Flk2 compartment that differ in their expression of GATA1 a critical transcription factor repopulating cells exhibited the cell surface phenotype KLS Flk2 to int CD150 int CD105 cMPL and were termed FSE cells progenitors were identified as KLS Flk2 CD150 and cMPL and were termed Flk CD150 cells FSE cells had increased potential in culture and transplant settings and exhibited a higher clonal frequency of activity compared with Flk CD150 cells suggesting functional consequences of GATA1 upregulation in promoting megakaryocyte and erythroid lineage priming Activation of ERK and AKT cascades was observed by intracellular flow cytometry in HSCs and FSE cells but not in Flk CD150 cells

Abstract Disentangling cellular heterogeneity is a challenge in many fields particularly in the stem cell and cancer biology fields Here we demonstrate how to combine viral genetic barcoding with sequencing to track single cells in a heterogeneous population We use this technique to track the in vivo differentiation of unitary hematopoietic stem cells HSCs The results are consistent with transplantation studies but require two orders of magnitude fewer mice In addition to its high throughput the high sensitivity of the technique allows for a direct examination of the clonality of sparse cell populations such as HSCs We show how these capabilities offer a clonal perspective of the HSC differentiation process In particular our data suggest that HSCs do not equally contribute to blood cells after transplantation and that two distinct HSC differentiation patterns in the same recipient mouse after irradiation This technique can be applied to any cell type for both in vitro and

protein subunits has been implicated in myelodysplastic syndrome and Diamond Blackfan anemia but the cellular and pathophysiologic defects associated with these conditions are enigmatic Using conditional inactivation of the ribosomal protein S6 gene in laboratory mice we found that reduced ribosomal protein gene dosage recapitulates cardinal features of the syndrome including macrocytic anemia erythroid hypoplasia and megakaryocytic dysplasia with thrombocytosis and that p53 plays a critical role in manifestation of these phenotypes The blood cell abnormalities are accompanied by a reduction in the number of HSCs a specific defect in late erythrocyte development and suggest a ontogenetic pathway for megakaryocyte development Further studies of highly purified HSCs from healthy

and progenitor cells HSPCs in human BM has precluded analysis of the direct biochemical effects elicited by cytokines in these populations and their functional consequences Here flow cytometry was used to define the signaling networks active in 5 previously defined human HSPC subsets This analysis revealed that the currently defined HSC compartment is composed of biochemically distinct subsets with the ability to respond rapidly and directly in vitro to a broader array of cytokines than previously appreciated including The response was physiologically entry and increased proliferation in a subset of single cells within the HSC compartment The heterogeneity in the signaling and proliferation responses prompted subfractionation of the adult BM HSC compartment by expression of CD114 receptor Xenotransplantation assays revealed that HSC activity is significantly enriched in the CD114 compartment and almost completely absent in the CD114 pos subfraction The analyses used here can

DIPGs are highly aggressive tumors of childhood that are almost universally fatal Our understanding of this devastating cancer is limited by a dearth of available tissue for study and by the lack of a faithful animal model Intriguingly DIPGs are restricted to the ventral pons and occur during a narrow window of middle childhood suggesting dysregulation of a postnatal neurodevelopmental process Here we report the identification of a previously undescribed population of immunophenotypic neural precursor cells in the human and murine brainstem whose temporal and spatial distributions correlate closely with the incidence of DIPG and highlight a candidate cell of origin Using early postmortem DIPG tumor tissue we have established in vitro and xenograft models and find that the Hedgehog Hh signaling pathway implicated in many developmental and oncogenic processes is active in DIPG tumor cells Modulation of Hh pathway activity has functional consequences for DIPG capacity in neurosphere culture The Hh pathway also appears to be active in normal ventral pontine cells of the mouse and unregulated pathway activity results in hypertrophy of the ventral pons Together these findings

their use of various in vitro and in vivo assays To consolidate these discordant findings we compared the myeloid potential of 2 putative thymus seeding populations common lymphoid progenitors CLPs and multipotent progenitors MPPs and the earliest intrathymic progenitor DN1 using 2 in vitro assays and in vivo readouts These assays gave contradictory results CLP and DN1 displayed surprisingly robust myeloid potential on in vitro stromal cocultures but displayed little myeloid potential in vivo as well as in methylcellulose cultures MPP on the other hand displayed robust myeloid potential

Abstract The promise of pluripotent stem cells as a research and therapeutic tool is partly undermined by the technical challenges of generating and maintaining these cells in culture Human embryonic stem cells hESCs are exquisitely sensitive to culture conditions and require constant signaling by growth factors and and interactions to prevent apoptosis senescence and differentiation Previous work from our laboratory demonstrated that overexpression of the prosurvival gene BCL2 in mouse embryonic stem cells overrode the requirement of serum factors and feeder cells to maintain mESCs in culture To determine whether this prosurvival gene could similarly protect hESCs we generated hESC lines that constitutively or inducibly express BCL2 We find that BCL2 overexpression significantly decreases apoptosis resulting in enhanced colony formation from sorted single cells and enhanced embryoid body formation In addition exhibit normal growth in the absence of serum but require basic fibroblast growth factor to remain undifferentiated Furthermore they maintain their pluripotency markers form teratomas in vivo and differentiate into all three germ layers Our data suggest that the BCL2 signaling pathway plays an important role in inhibiting hESC apoptosis such that its overexpression in hESCs offers both a survival benefit in conditions of stress by resisting apoptosis and obviates

Although overall prognosis for pediatric ALL is favorable pediatric patients and most adult patients have significantly worse outcomes Multiagent chemotherapy is standard of care for both pediatric and adult ALL but is associated with systemic toxicity and side effects and is relatively ineffective against certain ALL subtypes Recent efforts have focused on the development of targeted therapies for ALL including monoclonal antibodies Here we report the identification of CD47 a protein that inhibits phagocytosis as an antibody target in standard and ALL CD47 was found to be more highly expressed on a subset of human ALL patient samples compared with normal cell counterparts and to be an independent predictor of survival and disease refractoriness in several ALL patient cohorts In addition a blocking monoclonal antibody against CD47 enabled phagocytosis of ALL cells by macrophages in vitro and inhibited tumor engraftment in vivo Significantly antibody eliminated ALL in the

cellular homeostasis is partly regulated by a balance of and signals CD47 which prevents cancer cell phagocytosis by the innate immune system is highly expressed on several human cancers including acute myeloid leukemia lymphoma and bladder cancer Blocking CD47 with a monoclonal antibody results in phagocytosis of cancer cells and leads to in vivo tumor elimination yet normal cells remain

interaction of target cell calreticulin with its receptor lipoprotein protein on phagocytic cells prevented phagocytosis Furthermore increased calreticulin expression was an adverse prognostic factor

advance in regenerative medicine Pluripotent stem cell lines can now be generated from an individual own cells facilitating the generation of immunologically acceptable stem therapeutics Many cell types can undergo nuclear reprogramming leading to the question of whether the identity of the reprogrammed cell of origin has a biological consequence Peripheral blood containing a mixture of T B NK and myeloid cell types represents one potential source of reprogrammable cells In this study we describe the unique case of mice derived from a reprogrammed T cell These mice have prerearranged receptor TCR genes in all cells Surprisingly of mice with prerearranged TCR genes develop spontaneous T cell lymphomas which originate in the thymus The lymphomas arise from developing T cells and contain activated Notch1 similar to most human and mouse acute lymphoblastic lymphomas Furthermore lymphomagenesis requires the expression of both prerearranged TCRα and TCRβ genes indicating a critical role for TCR signaling Furthermore inhibitors of multiple branches of TCR signaling suppress lymphoma growth implicating TCR signaling as an essential component in lymphoma proliferation The lymphomagenesis in mice derived from a reprogrammed T cell demonstrates the deleterious consequences of misregulation of the TCR rearrangement and signaling pathways and illustrates one case of

types stands on one specific cell type hematopoietic stem cell HSC Within the system only HSCs possess the ability of both multipotency and Multipotency is the ability to differentiate into all functional blood cells is the ability to give rise to HSC itself without differentiation Since mature blood cells MBCs are predominantly HSCs continuously provide more differentiated progenitors while properly maintaining the HSC pool size throughout life by precisely balancing and differentiation Thus understanding the mechanisms of and differentiation of HSC has been a central issue In this review we focus on the hierarchical structure of the hematopoietic system the current understanding of microenvironment and molecular cues regulating and differentiation of adult HSCs and the

associated with an increase in the white blood cell WBC count This association has been attributed to bronchopulmonary inflammation infection It is not known if nicotine itself may play a role The objective of this study was to determine whether nicotine itself could affect the WBC count and to determine whether this was due to a direct effect on hematopoietic stem cells HSC C57Bl6J mice received nicotine orally and measurements of the WBC count bone marrow and spleen cellularity and HSC count were made To determine the functionality of HSCs irradiated animals received bone marrow transplants from vehicle or mice Nicotine increased leukocytes in the peripheral blood bone marrow and spleen The peripheral red cell and platelet count were unaffected Nicotine increased the frequency of HSC in the bone marrow Isolated HSCs from mice transplanted into irradiated mice regenerated all hematopoietic cell lineages demonstrating the functional competence of those HSCs HSCs expressed nicotinic acetylcholine receptors nAChRs as documented by binding Nicotine increased soluble Kit ligand consistent with stem cell activation In conclusion the data suggest a new mechanism for the increased WBC associated with tobacco use The effect of nicotine to activate hematopoiesis may contribute to diseases View details for DOI View details for Web of Science ID 000282582300004

Takeuchi Cunniff Hongguang Naveiras Yoon Irizarry Jung Seita Hanna Murakami Jaenisch Weissleder Orkin Weissman Feinberg Daley Q 2010 467 7313 Abstract Somatic cell nuclear transfer and reprogramming revert adult cells to an embryonic state and yield pluripotent stem cells that can generate all tissues Through different mechanisms and kinetics these two reprogramming methods reset genomic methylation an epigenetic modification of DNA that influences gene expression leading us to hypothesize that the resulting pluripotent stem cells might have different properties Here we observe that induced pluripotent stem cells iPSCs derived by reprogramming of adult murine tissues harbour residual DNA methylation signatures characteristic of their somatic tissue of origin which favours their differentiation along lineages related to the donor cell while restricting alternative cell fates Such an memory of the donor tissue could be reset by differentiation and serial reprogramming or by treatment of iPSCs with drugs In contrast the differentiation and methylation of pluripotent stem cells were more similar to classical embryonic stem cells than were iPSCs Our data indicate that nuclear transfer is more effective at establishing the ground state of pluripotency than reprogramming which can leave an epigenetic memory of the tissue of origin that may influence efforts at directed differentiation for applications in disease modelling or treatment View details for DOI View details for Web of Science ID 000281824900030 View details for PubMedID 20644535 View details for

Karsunky Ho Daley Weissman Feinberg 2010 467 7313 Abstract Epigenetic modifications must underlie differentiation as terminally differentiated cells express genes but their DNA sequence is unchanged Haematopoiesis provides a model to study epigenetic modifications during decisions as multipotent progenitors MPPs differentiate into progressively restricted myeloid or lymphoid progenitors Although DNA methylation is critical for myeloid versus lymphoid differentiation as demonstrated by the myeloerythroid bias in Dnmt1 hypomorphs a comprehensive DNA methylation map of haematopoietic progenitors or of any lineage does not exist Here we examined million CpG sites throughout the genome for MPPs common lymphoid progenitors CLPs common myeloid progenitors CMPs progenitors GMPs and thymocyte progenitors DN1 DN2 DN3 Marked epigenetic plasticity accompanied both lymphoid and myeloid restriction Myeloid commitment involved less global DNA methylation than lymphoid commitment supported functionally by myeloid skewing of progenitors following treatment with a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor Differential DNA methylation correlated with gene expression more strongly at CpG island shores than CpG islands Many examples of genes and pathways not previously known to be involved in choice between differentiation have been identified such as Arl4c and Jdp2 Several transcription factors including Meis1 were methylated and silenced during differentiation indicating a role in maintaining an undifferentiated state Additionally epigenetic modification of modifiers of the epigenome seems to be important in haematopoietic differentiation Our results directly demonstrate that modulation of DNA methylation occurs during differentiation and defines a comprehensive map of

could have deleterious physiologic consequences To determine whether such Vbeta rearrangements occur and if so how they might be regulated we analyzed mice with TCRbeta alleles containing preassembled functional VbetaDJbetaCbeta1 genes Vbeta10 segments were transcribed rearranged and expressed in thymocytes when located immediately upstream of a Vbeta1DJbetaCbeta1 gene but not on alleles with a Vbeta14DJbetaCbeta1 gene Germline Vbeta10 transcription was silenced in mature alphabeta T cells This and developmental silencing of Vbeta10 correlated with increased CpG methylation and decreased histone acetylation over the Vbeta10 promoter and coding region Transcription rearrangement and expression of the Vbeta4 and Vbeta16 segments located upstream of Vbeta10 were silenced on alleles containing either VbetaDJbetaCbeta1 gene sequences within Vbeta4 Vbeta16 and the intergenic region exhibited constitutive high CpG methylation and low histone acetylation Collectively our data indicate that the position of Vbeta segments relative to assembled VbetaDJbetaCbeta1 genes influences their rearrangement and suggest that DNA sequences between Vbeta segments may form boundaries

genes MiDReG to predict genes whose expression is either activated or repressed as precursor cells differentiate MiDReG does not require gene expression data from intermediate stages of development MiDReG is based on the gene expression patterns between the initial and terminal stages of the differentiation pathway coupled with rules Boolean implications mined from microarray databases MiDReG uses two gene seed conditions that mark the initial and the terminal stages of a given differentiation pathway and combines the statistically inferred Boolean implications from these seed conditions to identify the relevant genes The method was validated by applying it to development The algorithm predicted 62 genes that are expressed after the progenitor cell stage and remain expressed through and germinal center B cells of 14 of these genes on sorted progenitors confirmed that the expression of 10 genes is indeed stably established during differentiation Review of the published literature of knockout mice revealed that of the predicted genes have defects in differentiation and function and 22 have a role in the B cell according to other experiments and the remaining are not characterized Therefore our method identified novel gene candidates for future examination of their role in development These data demonstrate the power of MiDReG in predicting functionally important

developmental program could aid understanding of the disease and lead to new treatments but many aspects of the process including their developmental origin remain obscure Here we show using histological and clonal analysis in mice and cardiac organ culture that coronary vessels arise from angiogenic sprouts of the sinus vein that returns blood to the embryonic heart Sprouting venous endothelial cells dedifferentiate as they migrate over and invade the myocardium Invading cells differentiate into arteries and capillaries cells on the surface redifferentiate into veins These

of hematopoietic stem cells from mesodermal precursors has finished by life Once established the hematopoietic system must supply blood cells to host circulation and tissues for the entire life of the

8 and CD4 8 thymocytes were confined to cortex where they moved slowly without directional bias DP cells accumulated and migrated more rapidly in a specialized microenvironment but were unable to migrate on medullary substrates In contrast CD4 single positive SP thymocytes migrated directionally toward the medulla where they accumulated and moved very rapidly Our results revealed a requisite process governing CD4 SP cell medullary localization the chemokine receptor CCR7 mediated chemotaxis of CD4 SP cells towards medulla whereas a distinct sensitive pathway was required for medullary

206 12 Abstract Hematopoietic stem cells HSCs are thought to reside in discrete niches through stable adhesion yet previous studies have suggested that host HSCs can be replaced by transplanted donor HSCs even in the absence of cytoreductive conditioning To explain this apparent paradox we calculated through cell surface phenotyping and transplantation of unfractionated blood that approximately of the total pool of HSCs enters into the circulation each day Bromodeoxyuridine BrdU feeding experiments demonstrated that HSCs in the peripheral blood incorporate BrdU at the same rate as do HSCs in the bone marrow suggesting that egress from the bone marrow to the blood can occur without cell division and can leave behind vacant HSC niches Consistent with this repetitive daily transplantations of small numbers of HSCs administered as new niches became available over the course of 7 d led to significantly higher levels of engraftment than did large transplantations of the same total number of HSCs These data provide insight as to how HSC replacement can occur despite the residence of endogenous HSCs in niches and suggest therapeutic interventions that capitalize upon physiological HSC

recapitulated the heterogeneity of the original tumor Further molecular analysis of more than 300 bladder cancer specimens revealed heterogeneity among activated oncogenic pathways in 80 Gli1 45 Stat3 10 and 5 Despite this molecular heterogeneity we identified a unique bladder gene signature by gene chip analysis This gene signature which effectively distinguishes bladder cancer with worse clinical prognosis from superficial cancer has significant clinical value It also can predict the progression of a subset of recurring cancers Finally we found that CD47 a protein that provides an inhibitory signal for macrophage phagocytosis is highly expressed in bladder compared with the rest of the tumor Blockade of CD47 by a mAb resulted in macrophage engulfment of bladder cancer cells in vitro In summary we have identified a subpopulation with potential prognostic and therapeutic value for invasive bladder cancer View details for DOI View details for PubMedID 19666525 The ISSCR who are we and

Jaiswal Gibbs van Rooijen Weissman 2009 138 2 Abstract Acute myeloid leukemia AML is organized as a cellular hierarchy initiated and maintained by a subset of leukemia stem cells LSC We hypothesized that increased CD47 expression on human AML LSC contributes to pathogenesis by inhibiting their phagocytosis through the interaction of CD47 with an inhibitory receptor on phagocytes We found that CD47 was more highly expressed on AML LSC than their normal counterparts and that increased CD47 expression predicted worse overall survival in three independent cohorts of adult AML patients Furthermore blocking monoclonal antibodies directed against CD47 preferentially enabled phagocytosis of AML LSC and inhibited their engraftment in vivo Finally treatment of human AML mice with antibody depleted AML and targeted AML LSC In summary increased CD47 expression is an independent poor prognostic factor that can be targeted on human AML stem cells with blocking monoclonal antibodies capable of enabling phagocytosis of LSC View details for DOI View details for PubMedID 19632179 CD47 Is Upregulated on Circulating Hematopoietic Stem Cells and Leukemia Cells to Avoid Phagocytosis CELL Jaiswal Jamieson Pang Park Chao Majeti Traver van Rooijen Weissman 2009 138 2 Abstract Macrophages clear pathogens and damaged or aged cells from the blood stream via phagocytosis CD47 interacts with its receptor on macrophages SIRPalpha to inhibit phagocytosis of normal healthy cells We find that mobilizing cytokines and inflammatory stimuli cause CD47 to be transiently upregulated on mouse hematopoietic stem cells HSCs and progenitors just prior to and during their migratory phase and that the level of CD47 on these cells determines the probability that they are engulfed in vivo CD47 is also constitutively upregulated on mouse and human myeloid leukemias and overexpression of CD47 on a myeloid leukemia line increases its pathogenicity by allowing it to evade phagocytosis We conclude that CD47 upregulation is an important mechanism that provides protection to normal HSCs during mobilization and that leukemic progenitors this ability in order to evade

hematopoietic system of mice is established during the early to midgestational stage of development However the earliest lymphohematopoietic progenitors that appear during mouse development have been less well characterized compared with the hematopoietic stem cell compartment of fetal liver and bone marrow We isolated the earliest lymphohematopoietic progenitors by using embryonic stem ES cell culture in vitro Cells with the Lin cell surface phenotype were present abundantly in ES cells cocultured with stromal cell lines We further separated the cells into two distinct cell subsets based on expression Although and cells had equivalent potency to generate myeloid cell lineages the lymphoid potential in cells was largely restricted to the cells expressing The same cell type was present abundantly in the early yolk sac and in fewer numbers approximately 5 of that in the yolk sac in the caudal half of the developing embryos These data suggest that is a cell surface marker that can

cancer stem cells NATURE Diehn Cho Lobo Kalisky Dorie Kulp Qian Lam Ailles Wong Joshua Kaplan Wapnir Dirbas Somlo Garberoglio Paz Shen Lau Quake Brown Weissman Clarke 2009 458 7239 Abstract The metabolism of oxygen although central to life produces reactive oxygen species ROS that have been implicated in processes as diverse as cancer cardiovascular disease and ageing It has recently been shown that central nervous system stem cells and haematopoietic stem cells and early progenitors contain lower levels of ROS than their more mature progeny and that these differences are critical for maintaining stem cell function We proposed that epithelial tissue stem cells and their cancer stem cell CSC counterparts may also share this property Here we show that normal mammary epithelial stem cells contain lower concentrations of ROS than their more mature progeny cells Notably subsets of CSCs in some human and murine breast tumours contain lower ROS levels than corresponding cells NTCs Consistent with ROS being critical mediators of cell killing CSCs in these tumours develop less DNA damage and are preferentially spared after irradiation compared to NTCs Lower ROS levels in CSCs are associated with increased expression of free radical scavenging systems Pharmacological depletion of ROS scavengers in CSCs markedly decreases their clonogenicity and results in radiosensitization These results indicate that similar to normal tissue stem cells subsets of CSCs in some tumours contain lower ROS levels and enhanced ROS defences compared to their progeny which may contribute to tumour radioresistance View details for DOI View details for PubMedID 19194462 Glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta missplicing contributes to leukemia stem cell generation PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL

evidence suggests that a rare population of cancer stem cells CSC is responsible for cancer progression and therapeutic resistance Chronic myeloid leukemia CML represents an important paradigm for understanding the genetic and epigenetic events involved in CSC production CML progresses from a chronic phase CP in hematopoietic stem cells HSC that harbor the translocation to blast crisis BC characterized by aberrant activation of within progenitors GMP A major barrier to predicting and inhibiting blast crisis transformation has been the identification of mechanisms driving activation Here we show that BC CML myeloid progenitors in particular GMP serially transplant leukemia in immunocompromised mice and thus are enriched for leukemia stem cells LSC Notably cDNA sequencing of pathway regulatory genes including adenomatous polyposis coli GSK3beta axin 1 lymphoid enhancer cyclin D1 and revealed a novel splice deletion of the GSK3beta kinase domain in the GMP of BC samples that was not detectable by sequencing in blasts or normal progenitors Moreover BC CML progenitors with misspliced GSK3beta have enhanced expression as well as serial engraftment potential while reintroduction of GSK3beta reduces both in vitro replating and leukemic engraftment We propose that CP CML is initiated by expression in an HSC clone but that progression to BC may include missplicing of GSK3beta in GMP LSC enabling unphosphorylated to participate in LSC Missplicing of GSK3beta represents a unique mechanism for the emergence of BC CML LSC and might provide a novel diagnostic and

Cell Differentiation STEM CELLS AND DEVELOPMENT Xie Chan Cao Huang Li Lee Weissman Wu 2009 18 2 Abstract Signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 STAT3 is a pleiotropic transcription factor involved in a variety of physiological processes STAT3 acts as a key transcriptional determinant of mouse embryonic stem ES cell and plays a pivotal function in early mammalian embryogenesis because the development of many organs requires STAT3 activation However little is known about the role of STAT3 function during ES cell differentiation To answer this question we built a lentiviral construct with sequence enhancer and minimal TA promoter driving renilla luciferase and monomeric red fluorescence protein followed by a constitutive cytomegalovirus promoter driving green fluorescent protein as a selection marker The specificity of our STAT3 reporter construct was first confirmed by cotransfection with constitutively active version of STAT3 STAT3C into human embryonic kidney 293T cells Next a mouse ES cell line stably transduced with STAT3 reporter construct was isolated This ES cell line showed a tight response in reporter gene expression with leukemia inhibitory factor LIF induction and was chosen as a developmental model for the STAT3 functional study Using serial noninvasive bioluminescence imaging we showed that the onset of embryoid body EB formation involved inhibition of STAT3 activity However during differentiation STAT3 activity steadily increased from day 5 to 14 and was reduced by day 21 STAT3 activity was also confirmed separately by Western blots Finally phosphorylation of STAT3 was also found to correspond with cardiomyocyte differentiation In summary this is the first study to monitor STAT3 activity during ES cell differentiation This genetically modified line can be used to study the biological role of STAT3 during ES cell differentiation into different derivatives View details for DOI View details for Web of Science ID

depletion of erythroid progenitors the erythrocyte and megakaryocyte compartments were equivalent in bone marrow as compared with mice HSCs also failed to efficiently maintain the HSC pool on serial transplantation and we demonstrate that the E2A proteins regulate cell cycle progression of HSCs by regulating the expression of p21 Cip1 p27 Kip1 and the thrombopoietin receptor known regulators of

we take a comprehensive approach to prospectively identify the major source of thymocyte progenitors that reside within the BM and blood and find that all thymocyte progenitor activity resides within a rare Flk2 CD27 population The BM Flk2 CD27 subset is predominantly composed of common lymphoid progenitors CLPs and multipotent progenitors Of these 2 populations only CLPs reconstitute thymopoiesis rapidly after intravenous injection In contrast multipotent cells reconstitute the thymus with delayed kinetics only after they have reseeded the BM and generated CLPs These results identify CLPs as

single ligand the chemokine CX 3 CL1 fractalkine All blood monocytes express CX 3 CR1 but its levels differ between the main 2 subsets with human CD16 and murine Gr1 low monocytes being CX 3 CR1 hi Here we report that absence of either CX 3 CR1 or CX 3 CL1 results in a significant reduction of Gr1 low blood monocyte levels under both and inflammatory conditions Introduction of a Bcl2 transgene restored the phenotype suggesting that the CX 3 C axis provides an essential survival signal Supporting this notion we show that CX 3 CL1 specifically rescues cultured human monocytes from induced cell death Human CX 3 CR1 gene polymorphisms are risk factors for atherosclerosis and mice deficient for the CX 3 C receptor or ligand are relatively protected from atherosclerosis development However the mechanistic role of CX 3 CR1 in atherogenesis remains unclear Here we show that enforced survival of monocytes and phagocytes including foam cells restored atherogenesis in CX 3 mice The fact that CX 3 3 CR1 interactions confer an essential survival signal whose absence leads to increased death of monocytes foam cells might provide a mechanistic explanation for the role of the CX 3 C chemokine

proximal epiblast However tracing of the fate of the cells has not been done wherein all cells in and around the lineage are identified Also quantitative estimates of the number of founder PGCs using different models have come up with various numbers Here we use tetrachimeric mice to show that the progenitor numbers for the entire germ line in adult testis and for the initiating embryonic PGCs are both 4 cells Although they proliferate to form polyclonal populations in fetal and neonatal testes germ cells that actually contribute to adult spermatogenesis originate from a small number of secondary founder cells that originate in the fetal period The rest of the deciduous germ cells are lost most likely by apoptosis before the reproductive period The second actual founder germ cells generally form small numbers of large monoclonal areas in testes by the reproductive period Our results also demonstrate that there is no contribution of somatic cells to the male germ cell pool

hematopoietic progenitors and is accompanied by increased apoptosis in lymphoid progenitor populations Loss of quiescence in the TKO HSC pool is associated with an expansion of these mutant stem cells

mammalian blood system contains a multitude of distinct mature cell lineages adapted to serving diverse functional roles Mutations that abrogate the development or function of one or more of these lineages can lead to profound adverse consequences such as immunodeficiency autoimmunity or anemia Replacement of hematopoietic stem cells HSC that carry such mutations with HSC from a healthy donor can reverse such disorders but because the risks associated with the procedure are often more serious than the blood disorders themselves bone marrow transplantation is generally not used to treat a number of relatively common inherited blood diseases Aside from a number of other problems risks associated with cytoreductive treatments that create space for donor HSC and the slow kinetics with which immune competence is restored following transplantation hamper progress This review will focus on how recent studies using experimental model systems may direct future efforts to implement

potential for the B and T lineages BLOOD Karsunky Inlay Serwold Bhattacharya Weissman 2008 111 12 Abstract Mature blood cells develop from multipotent hematopoietic stem cells through a series of sequential intermediates in which the developmental potential for particular blood lineages is progressively extinguished We previously reported the identification of one of these developmental intermediates the common lymphoid progenitor CLP which can give rise to T cells B cells dendritic cells DCs and natural killer cells NKs but lacks myeloid and erythroid potential Recently several studies have suggested that the and DC potential of CLP is limited or absent that CLP contains significant myeloid potential Here we show that the originally identified CLP population can be divided into functionally distinct subsets based on the expression of the tyrosine kinase receptor Flk2 The Flk2 subset contains robust in vivo and in vitro DC and NK potential but lacks myeloid potential and therefore represents an oligopotent progenitor This population of cells does not appear to be B and robustly reconstitutes both B and T lineages in vivo consistent with its being a physiologic progenitor of both of these subsets Thus Flk2 expression defines a homogeneous readily obtainable subset of bone marrow CLP that is completely and can differentiate equivalently well into both B and T

These prospectively isolated liver progenitor cells supported hepatitis D virus infection expressed and produced albumin and as tracked by and lentiviral promoter reporter constructs and measured by ELISA respectively Coculture in 3D fibrin gel with endothelial cells resulted in the formation of vascular structures by the endothelial cells and increased proliferation of liver progenitors The enhanced proliferation of liver progenitors that was observed when liver progenitors and endothelial cells were cultured in direct contact was not achieved when liver progenitors and endothelial cells

the origin of neovascular endothelial cells ECs are controversial Neovascular ECs have been proposed to originate from VEGF receptor stem cells mobilized from the BM by VEGF or tumors and it is thought that angiogenesis and tumor growth may depend on such endothelial precursors or progenitors We studied the mobilization of BM cells to circulation by inoculating mice with VEGF polypeptides adenoviral vectors expressing VEGF or tumors We induced angiogenesis by syngeneic melanomas APCmin adenomas adenoviral VEGF delivery or matrigel plugs in four different genetically tagged universal or endothelial chimeric mouse models and subsequently analyzed the contribution of cells to endothelium in a wide range of time points To study the existence of circulating ECs in a nonmyeloablative setting pairs of genetically marked parabiotic mice with a shared anastomosed circulatory system were created We did not observe specific mobilization of cells to circulation by VEGF or tumors During angiogenesis abundant perivascular cells were recruited close to blood vessel wall ECs but did not form part of the endothelium No vascular ECs were observed in the parabiosis experiments Our results show that no or other EC precursors contribute to vascular endothelium and that cancer growth does not require endothelial progenitors Endothelial differentiation is not a typical in vivo function of

SIRT1 in a genetically defined system we show that efficient inhibition of SIRT1 in human cells enhanced cell growth under normal and nutrient limiting conditions Hematopoietic stem cells obtained from mice also showed increased growth capacity and decreased dependency on growth factors Consistent with this SIRT1 inhibition was associated with increased telomerase activity in human cells We also observed a significant increase in AMPK levels up on SIRT1 inhibition under glucose limiting conditions Although SIRT1 suppression cooperated with hTERT to promote cell growth either

Hierarchy 73rd Cold Spring Harbor Symposium on Quantitative Biology Chao Seita Weissman COLD SPRING HARBOR LABORATORY PRESS 2008 Abstract Many types of adult tissues especially for high turnover tissues such as the blood and intestinal system stand on a hierarchical stem cell system stem cells concurrently have capacity and potential to give rise to all types of mature cells in their tissue The differentiation process of the stem cell is successive restriction of these capacities The first progeny of stem cells are multipotent progenitors MPPs that lose capacity yet have full lineage potential MPPs in turn give rise to oligopotent progenitors which then commit into progenitors This hierarchical system enables a lifelong supply of matured functional cells that generally have a short life span and a relatively high turnover rate In this chapter we review our findings and other key experiments that have led to the establishment of the current cellular stem and progenitor

proposed that cumulative somatic mutations contribute to the aging process by disrupting the transcriptional networks that regulate cell structure and function Experimental support for this model emerged from a recent study of cardiomyocytes that showed a dramatic increase in the transcriptional heterogeneity of these postmitotic cells with age To determine if regulatory instability is a hallmark of aging in renewing tissues we evaluated gene expression noise in four hematopoietic cell types stem cells granulocytes naïve B cells and naïve T cells We used flow cytometry to purify phenotypically equivalent cells from young and old mice and applied multiplexed quantitative reverse chain reaction to measure the copy number of six different mRNA transcripts in 324 individual cells There was a trend toward higher transcript levels in cells isolated from old animals but no significant increase in transcriptional heterogeneity with age was found in the surveyed populations Flow cytometric analysis of membrane protein expression also indicated that variability was unaffected by age We conclude that regulatory destabilization is not a universal concomitant of aging and may be

more rapidly generate specific Abs upon Ag exposure than their naive counterparts To determine the intrinsic differences that distinguish naive and memory B cells and to identify pathways that allow germinal center B cells to differentiate into memory B cells we compared the transcriptional profiles of highly purified populations of these three cell types along with plasma cells isolated from mice immunized with a Ag The transcriptional profile of memory B cells is similar to that of naive B cells yet displays several important differences including increased expression of deaminase and several antiapoptotic genes chemotactic receptors and costimulatory molecules Retroviral expression of either Klf2 or Ski two transcriptional regulators specifically enriched in memory B cells relative to their germinal center precursors imparted a competitive advantage to Ag receptor and B cells in vitro These data suggest that humoral recall responses are more rapid than primary responses

Seita Czechowicz Bhattacharya Bryder Weissman 2007 6 19 Abstract The aging of stem and progenitor cells is believed to be central to the pathophysiological conditions arising in aged individuals While the mechanisms driving stem cell aging are poorly understood mounting evidence points to DNA damage accrual as an important contributing factor While it has been postulated that DNA damage may deplete stem cell numbers with age recent studies indicate that murine hematopoietic stem cell HSC reserves are in fact maintained despite the accrual of genomic damage with age Evidence suggests this to be a result of the quiescent G0 cell cycle status of HSC which results in an attenuation of checkpoint control and DNA damage responses for repair or apoptosis When aged stem cells that have acquired damage are called into cycle under conditions of stress or tissue regeneration however their functional capacity was shown to be severely impaired These data suggest that DNA damage accumulation may underlie the diminished capacity of aged stem cells to mediate a return to homeostasis after acute stress or injury Moreover the cytoprotection afforded by stem cell quiescence in conditions suggests a mechanism through which potentially dangerous lesions can accumulate in the stem cell pool with age View details for Web of Science ID 000251085700012 View details for PubMedID 17700071 Elucidation

the expression pattern of WT1 during normal and neoplastic hematopoiesis we generated a reporter green fluorescent protein GFP mouse WT1 and assayed for WT1 expression in normal and leukemic hematopoietic cells In normal hematopoietic cells WT1 was expressed in none of the LT hematopoietic stem cells HSC and very few 1 of the multipotent progenitor cells In contrast in murine leukemias induced by acute myeloid leukemia 1 AML1 or WT1 was expressed in or of immature lin KLS cells which contained a subset but not all of transplantable leukemic stem cells LSCs WT1 expression was minimal in normal fetal liver HSCs and mobilized HSCs both of which are stimulated for proliferation In addition overexpression of WT1 in HSCs did not result in proliferation or expansion of HSCs and their

some genes in ES cells The unmethylated windows expand in cells that express the gene and contract disappear or remain unchanged in nonexpressing tissues However in ES cells they do not always coincide with common histone modifications Genomic footprinting and chromatin immunoprecipitation demonstrated that transcription factor binding underlies the unmethylated windows at enhancers for the Ptcra and Alb1 genes After stable integration of premethylated Ptcra enhancer constructs into the ES cell genome the unmethylated windows readily appeared In contrast the premethylated constructs remained fully methylated and silent after introduction into thymocytes These findings provide initial functional support for a model in which pioneer factor interactions in ES cells promote the assembly of a chromatin structure that is permissive for subsequent activation and in which differentiated tissues lack the machinery required for gene activation when these ES cell marks are absent The enhancer marks may therefore represent important features of the pluripotent state View details for DOI View details for Web of Science ID 000248472100027 View details for PubMedID 17640912 Early TCR expression and aberrant T cell development in mice with endogenous prerearranged T cell receptor genes JOURNAL OF IMMUNOLOGY Serwold Hochedlinger Inlay Jaenisch Weissman 2007 179 2 Abstract The factors that regulate the rate of production of T cells by the thymus remain incompletely defined To test whether generation of functional T cell receptors limits the rate of thymic T cell export we made use of a line of mice LN3alphabeta that have endogenously prerearranged TCR genes The prerearranged TCR genes were expressed abnormally early in hemopoietic development indicating that recombination rather than transcription factor expression is the key determinant of the initiation of robust TCR transcription Thymic T cell export rates were similar between wt and LN3alphabeta mice indicating that T cell maturation rates in these mice are determined by factors other than TCR gene rearrangement In competitive bone marrow chimeras however LN3alphabeta thymocytes were by wt cells and failed to develop beyond the 4 stage Furthermore wt progenitors transplanted intrathymically into LN3alphabeta mice proliferated excessively suggesting that increased proliferative signals in the LN3alphabeta thymus compensate for faulty T cell development driven by early TCR expression View details for Web of Science ID 000247752100029 View details for PubMedID 17617584 fluorescent mice

myeloid leukemia AML by chemotherapy alone remains elusive for most patients because of the inability to effectively eradicate leukemic stem cells LSCs the component of the leukemia To develop therapies that effectively target LSC one potential strategy is to identify cell surface markers that can distinguish LSC from normal hematopoietic stem cells HSCs In this study we employ a signal sequence trap strategy to isolate cell surface molecules expressed on human and find that CD96 which is a member of the Ig gene superfamily is a promising candidate as an antigen FACS analysis demonstrates that CD96 is expressed on the majority of CD34 CD38 AML cells in many cases in 19 of 29 cases whereas only a few cells in the normal population Lin CD34 CD38 CD90 expressed CD96 weakly To examine whether CD96 AML cells are enriched for LSC activity we separated AML cells into CD96 and CD96 fractions and transplanted them into irradiated newborn Rag2 gamma c mice In four of five samples

repair limit the function of haematopoietic stem cells with age NATURE Rossi Bryder Seita Nussenzweig Hoeijmakers Weissman 2007 447 7145 Abstract A diminished capacity to maintain tissue homeostasis is a central physiological characteristic of ageing As stem cells regulate tissue homeostasis depletion of stem cell reserves diminished stem cell function have been postulated to contribute to ageing It has further been suggested that accumulated DNA damage could be a principal mechanism underlying stem cell decline We have tested these hypotheses by examining haematopoietic stem cell reserves and function with age in mice deficient in several genomic maintenance pathways including nucleotide excision repair telomere maintenance and Here we show that although deficiencies in these pathways did not deplete stem cell reserves with age stem cell functional capacity was severely affected under conditions of stress leading to loss of reconstitution and proliferative potential diminished increased apoptosis and ultimately functional exhaustion Moreover we provide evidence that endogenous DNA damage accumulates with age in stem cells These data are consistent with DNA damage accrual being a physiological mechanism of stem cell ageing that may contribute to the diminished capacity of aged tissues to return to homeostasis after exposure to acute stress or injury View details for

embryonic lethality in its absence has prevented an assessment of its role in development Here using blastocyst complementation assays we demonstrate that Pbx1 null embryonic stem ES cells fail to generate common lymphoid progenitors CLPs resulting in a complete lack of B and NK cells and a partial impairment of development in chimeric mice A critical role for Pbx1 was confirmed by rescue of development from CLPs following restoration of its expression in ES cells In adoptive transfer experiments development from fetal liver cells was also severely compromised but not erased since transient B lymphopoiesis was detected in recipients Conditional inactivation of Pbx1 in CD19 cells and thereafter revealed that Pbx1 is not necessary for development to proceed from the stage Thus Pbx1 critically functions at a stage between hematopoietic stem cell development and commitment and therefore is one of the transcription factors that regulate de novo lymphopoiesis View details for

developmental processes which depend on accurate progression through a defined sequence of developmental stages Here we report a peculiar developmental scenario in a simple chordate Botryllus schlosseri wherein a normal colony of individuals zooids and buds is regenerated from the vasculature vascular budding through a sequence of morphologically abnormal developmental stages Vascular budding was induced by surgically removing buds and zooids from schlosseri colonies leaving only the vasculature and the tunic that connects them In vivo imaging and histological sections showed that the timing and morphology of developing structures during vascular budding deviated significantly from other asexual reproduction modes the regular asexual reproduction mode in this organism and vascular budding in other botryllid species Subsequent asexual reproduction cycles exhibited gradual regaining of normal developmental patterns eventually leading to regeneration of a normal colony The conversion into a normal body form suggests the activation of an alternative pathway of asexual reproduction which involves gradual regaining of normal positional information It presents a

heterogeneous population of cancer cells We developed an immunodeficient mouse model to test the tumorigenic potential of different populations of cancer cells derived from primary unmanipulated human HNSCC samples We show that a minority population of CD44 cancer cells which typically comprise 10 of the cells in a HNSCC tumor but not the CD44 cancer cells gave rise to new tumors in vivo Immunohistochemistry revealed that the CD44 cancer cells have a primitive cellular morphology and costain with the basal cell marker Cytokeratin whereas the CD44 cancer cells resemble differentiated squamous epithelium and express the differentiation marker Involucrin The tumors that arose from purified CD44 cells reproduced the original tumor heterogeneity and could be serially passaged thus demonstrating the two defining properties of stem cells ability to and to differentiate Furthermore the tumorigenic CD44 cells differentially express the BMI1 gene at both the RNA and protein levels By immunohistochemical analysis the CD44 cells in the tumor express high levels of nuclear BMI1 and are arrayed in characteristic tumor microdomains BMI1 has been demonstrated to play a role in in

selectively enriched in hematopoietic stem cells and were progressively lost in their and counterparts Furthermore transcripts selectively decreased in memory CD8 T cells were selectively in

profiles of memory naïve germinal center and plasma B cells Once again and transcripts were also appropriately augmented and diminished in hematopoietic stem cells and their expression correlated with progressive loss of function Thus there appears to be a common signature of both and transcripts shared between memory T cells memory B cells and hematopoietic stem cells This signature was not

Mende Karsunky Weissman Engleman Merad 2006 107 4 Abstract Langerhans cells LCs are cells APCs residing in the epidermis that play a major role in skin immunity Our earlier studies showed that when skin is inflamed LCs are replaced by bone progenitor cells while during conditions LCs are able to in the skin Identification of the LC progenitors in bone marrow would represent a critical step toward identifying the factors that regulate LC generation as well as their trafficking to the skin To determine LC lineage origin we reconstituted lethally irradiated mice with rigorously purified lymphoid and myeloid progenitors from congenic mice hours later we exposed the mice to UV light to deplete resident LCs and induce their replacement by progenitors Reconstitution with common myeloid progenitors CMPs common lymphoid progenitors CLPs progenitors GMPs or early thymic progenitors led to LC generation within 2 to 3 weeks CMPs were at least 20 times more efficient at generating LCs than CLPs LCs from both lineages were derived almost entirely from fetal liver progenitors displayed typical DC morphology and showed persistence in the skin These results indicate that LCs are

colonies but are not present among the progeny of purified MEP cells cultured under erythroid and megakaryocytic permissive conditions PEM cells increase to under acute and chronic stress whereas MEP cell increases 21 are observed only in acutely stressed animals These data suggest that MEP and PEM cells represent distinct cell populations that may exist in an differentiation relationship under

Purified hematopoietic stem cell engraftment of rare niches corrects severe lymphoid deficiencies without host conditioning JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MEDICINE Bhattacharya Rossi Bryder Weissman 2006 203 1 Abstract In the absence of irradiation or other cytoreductive conditioning endogenous hematopoietic stem cells HSCs are thought to fill the unique niches within the bone marrow that allow maintenance of full hematopoietic potential and thus prevent productive engraftment of transplanted donor HSCs By transplantation of purified exogenous HSCs into unconditioned congenic histocompatible strains of mice we show that approximately of these HSC niches are available for engraftment at any given point and find no evidence that endogenous HSCs can be displaced from the niches they occupy We demonstrate that productive engraftment of HSCs within these empty niches is inhibited by host T cells that recognize very subtle minor histocompatibility differences Strikingly transplantation of purified HSCs into a panel of severe combined immunodeficient SCID mice leads to a rapid and complete rescue of lymphoid deficiencies through engraftment of these very rare niches and expansion of donor lymphoid progenitors We further demonstrate that transient depletion of T cells allows HSC engraftment and regeneration of B cells in a mouse model of B These experiments provide a general mechanism by which transplanted HSCs can correct hematopoietic deficiencies without any host conditioning or with only highly specific and transient lymphoablation View details for DOI View details

Abstract This review focuses on the genomics of mouse hematopoiesis but also draws parallels to other systems and discusses issues common to the analysis of rare populations such as stem cells As examples from the mouse blood forming system are used to illustrate several points the authors first give a brief introduction to mouse hematopoiesis as a model system We review the multiple microarray analyses that have been performed on various mouse hematopoietic subpopulations and comment on both technical and biological aspects of such experiments The concept of stemness is discussed and the importance of biological function of gene products interactions and molecular pathways highlighted Finally the authors discuss some major unresolved issues in hematopoiesis and discuss the

cells are highly conserved biological units of development and regeneration Here we formally demonstrate that stem cell lineages are also legitimate units of natural selection In a colonial ascidian Botryllus schlosseri vascular fusion between genetically distinct individuals results in cellular parasitism of somatic tissues gametes or both We show that genetic hierarchies of somatic and gametic parasitism following fusion can be replicated by transplanting cells between colonies We prospectively isolate a population of multipotent stem cells that retain their competitive phenotype upon transplantation Their contribution to either somatic or germline fates but not to both is consistent with separate lineages of somatic and germline stem cells or pluripotent stem cells that differentiate according to the niche in which they land Since fusion is restricted to individuals that share a allele these data suggest that histocompatibility genes in Botryllus evolved to protect

Abstract Knowledge of the molecular networks controlling the proliferation and fate of hematopoietic stem cells HSC is essential to understand their function in maintaining blood cell production during normal hematopoiesis and upon clinical transplantation Using highly purified stem and progenitor cell populations we define the proliferation index and status of the cell cycle machinery at discrete stages of hematopoietic differentiation and during HSC mobilization We identify distinct sets of cell cycle proteins that specifically associate with differentiation and maintenance of quiescence in HSC and progenitor cells Moreover we describe a striking inequality of function among in vivo cycling and quiescent HSC by demonstrating that their engraftment potential resides predominantly in the G 0 fraction These data provide a direct link between HSC proliferation and function and identify discrete molecular targets in regulating HSC cell fate decisions that could have

Histocompatibility the ability of an organism to distinguish its own cells and tissue from those of another is a universal phenomenon in the Metazoa In vertebrates histocompatibility is a function of the immune system controlled by a highly polymorphic major histocompatibility complex MHC which encodes proteins that target foreign molecules for immune cell recognition The association of the MHC and immune function suggests an evolutionary relationship between metazoan histocompatibility and the origins of vertebrate immunity However the MHC of vertebrates is the only functionally characterized histocompatibility system the mechanisms underlying this process in are unknown A primitive chordate the ascidian Botryllus schlosseri also undergoes a histocompatibility reaction controlled by a highly polymorphic locus Here we describe the isolation of a candidate gene encoding an immunoglobulin superfamily member that by itself predicts the outcome of histocompatibility

MARY ANN LIEBERT 2005 Abstract Bone marrow BM cells have recently been shown to give rise to skeletal hepatic cardiac neural and vascular endothelial tissues However it has been shown that this is the result of cell fusion rather than transdifferentiation of hematopoietic stem cells HSC For this study we established a mouse model of brain tumor growth to investigate the differentiation potential of HSC into endothelial cells during brain angiogenesis Nontransgenic GFP neg recipient mice were lethally irradiated and their hematopoietic cells were subsequently repopulated by transplantation of a single green fluorescent protein GFP HSC Rat glioma cells were then injected into the striatum of the chimeric mice weeks The animals were sacrificed days after tumor implantation and the mobilization distribution and marker expression profile of the GFP cells within the growing tumor were analyzed We saw that GFP cells gave rise to elongated CD34 cells that incorporated into the endothelium of tumor blood vessels However all GFP cells were also CD45 and the presence of CD45 on the cells supports the hypothesis that the hematopoietic cells were recruited into the tumor milieu The fact that we failed to demonstrate the expression of von Willebrand factor in these cells argues against a true endothelial identity Nevertheless the recruitment of cells was an extremely rare event in normal

medical science and could usher in new therapies Today political religious and ethical issues surround embryonic stem cell and pluripotent stem cell research and are center stage in the attempts by

progenitors from a congenic mouse strain At various time points posttransplantation mice were analyzed for cells by flow cytometry The developmental potential of all progenitor populations was also tested in in vitro cultures In addition in vitro and in vivo derived IPCs were functionally assessed for their production after virus of 1 x 10 4 common myeloid progenitors 1 x 10 4 common lymphoid progenitors or x 10 4 progenitors all led to the generation of IPCs within 2 to 3 weeks In general IPC reconstitution in spleen and liver by CMPs was more efficient than by CLP Adding Flt3L alone to in vitro cultures was sufficient to support the development of IPCs from myeloid progenitors whereas CLPs required additional survival factors provided either by stroma cells or by introduction of transgenic Both and IPC were indistinguishable by function gene expression and our results clearly show that murine IPCs differentiate from both lineages but are mainly of myeloid origin These results

mice expressing a transgenic T cell receptor TCR specific for peptide epitope of the diabetes related self antigen glutamic acid decarboxylase GAD 65 in the context of g7 class II MHC that are paradoxically protected from diabetes In this report we examine the atypical cells in these mice Unlike typical class II restricted TCR transgenic mice GAD286 mice have normal numbers of cells half of which express high levels of the transgenic TCR These MHC mismatched cells persist in the periphery and proliferate to peptide in vitro and in vivo in a class II restricted fashion Interestingly the tetramer T cells that are expressing endogenous TCR can delay diabetes induction in a transfer model as we previously showed for T cells in these mice The MHC mismatched cells appear to be positively selected in an atypical fashion in that they do not upregulate CD69 or reexpress CD44 and they escape negative selection We find that production of these cells is not dependent on NOD thymus or high

Functional heterogeneity of cells within and engrafting skeletal muscle CELL Sherwood Christensen Conboy Conboy Rando Weissman Wagers J 2004 119 4 Abstract Skeletal muscle regeneration in adults is thought to occur through the action of myogenic satellite cells located in close association with mature muscle fibers however these precursor cells have not been prospectively isolated and recent studies have suggested that additional muscle progenitors including cells of bone marrow or hematopoietic origin may exist To clarify the origin s of adult myogenic cells we used phenotypic morphological and functional criteria to identify and prospectively isolate a subset of cells capable at the single cell level of generating myogenic colonies at high frequency Importantly although cells from marrow circulation localized to the same anatomic compartment as myogenic satellite cells and expressed some though not all satellite cell markers they displayed no intrinsic myogenicity

Telomerase maintained in tissues during serial regeneration of the urochordate Botryllus schlosseri DEVELOPMENTAL BIOLOGY Laird Weissman 2004 273 2 Abstract Telomerase is critical for the protection of germ line and stem cell chromosomes from fatal shortening during replication In most organisms telomerase activity is suppressed in progressively committed cells and falls to basal rates in terminally differentiated lineages The colonial ascidian Botryllus schlosseri propagates asexually and sexually presumably from pools of stem cells that throughout the to colony life span Asexual budding takes place continuously from the parental body wall When the colony reaches a critical size sexual reproduction commences with the generation of gonads Here we establish the existence of kb telomeres on the ends of Botryllus chromosomes We develop a quantitative PCR telomeric repeat amplification protocol TRAP assay that reliably detects TPG units in cells and tissues We find highest levels of enzymatic activity in the gonads developing embryos and tissues containing the earliest asexual buds Telomerase activity appears to be suppressed in later buds during organogenesis and falls to basal rates in mature zooids We postulate that this pattern reflects maximum telomere restoration in somatic stem cells of early buds and suppression of telomerase activity in progenitors and terminally differentiated cells indicative of an alternate role for stem cells as repeated body regenerators in colonial life histories View details for DOI View details for Web of Science ID

explore the role of Langerhans cells in GVHD the principal dendritic cells of the skin we studied the fate of these cells in mice transplanted with allogeneic bone marrow In contrast to other dendritic cells host Langerhans cells were replaced by donor Langerhans cells only when donor T cells were administered along with bone marrow and the extent of Langerhans cell chimerism correlated

Langerhans cells Administration of donor T cells to bone mice with persistent host Langerhans cells but not to mice whose Langerhans cells had been replaced resulted in marked skin GVHD These findings

maintenance of Hox gene expression particularly Hoxa7 and Hoxa9 is a feature of leukemias harboring leukemia MLL mutations To understand the pathogenic roles of Hox genes in MLL leukemias we assessed the impact of Hoxa7 or Hoxa9 nullizygosity on hematopoietic progenitor compartments and their susceptibility to leukemias Selective reductions in the absolute numbers of committed progenitors but not of hematopoietic stem cells distinguished and mice progenitor MEP reductions in Hoxa7 mice correlated with reticulocytosis and thrombocytopenia without anemia Conversely Hoxa9 mice displayed marked lymphopenia and substantial reductions of common lymphoid progenitors CLPs and lymphoid precursors in addition to significant reductions of common myeloid progenitors CMPs and progenitors GMPs In retroviral assays and progenitors remained susceptible to transformation by which activates MLL through a mechanism However Hoxa7 or Hoxa9 progenitors were less efficient in generating transformed blast units CFUs in vitro and induced leukemias with longer disease latencies reduced penetrance and less mature phenotypes Thus Hoxa7 and Hoxa9 contribute to hematopoietic progenitor homeostasis but are not necessary for leukemogenesis yet they appear to affect disease latency penetrance and phenotypes consistent with their critical roles as downstream targets of MLL fusion proteins View details

biology Christensen Wright Wagers Weissman 2004 2 3 Abstract The major site of hematopoiesis transitions from the fetal liver to the spleen and bone marrow late in fetal development To date experiments have not been performed to evaluate functionally the migration and seeding of hematopoietic stem cells HSCs during this period in ontogeny It has been proposed that developmentally timed waves of HSCs enter the bloodstream only during distinct windows to seed the newly forming hematopoietic organs Using competitive reconstitution assays to measure HSC activity we determined the localization of HSCs in the gestation fetus We found that multilineage reconstituting HSCs are present at low numbers in the blood at all timepoints measured Seeding of fetal bone marrow and spleen occurred over several days possibly while stem cell niches formed In addition using migration assays we determined that like bone marrow HSCs fetal liver HSCs migrate in response to stromal however unlike bone marrow HSCs the migratory response of fetal liver HSCs to is greatly increased in the presence of Steel factor SLF suggesting an important role for SLF in HSC homing to and seeding of the fetal hematopoietic tissues Together these data demonstrate that seeding of fetal organs by fetal liver HSCs does not require large fluxes of HSCs entering the fetal bloodstream and that HSCs constitutively circulate at low levels during the gestational period from 12 to 17 days postconception Newly forming hematopoietic tissues are seeded gradually by HSCs suggesting initial seeding is occurring as hematopoietic niches in the spleen and bone marrow form and become capable of supporting HSC We demonstrate that fetal and adult HSCs exhibit specific differences in chemotactic behavior While both migrate in response to fetal HSCs also respond significantly to the cytokine SLF In addition the combination of and SLF results in substantially enhanced migration of fetal HSCs leading to migration of nearly all fetal HSCs in this assay This finding indicates the importance of the combined effects of SLF and in the migration of fetal HSCs and is to our knowledge the first demonstration of a synergistic effect of two chemoattractive agents on HSCs View details for PubMedID 15024423 Continuous development precludes radioprotection in a colonial ascidian DEVELOPMENTAL AND COMPARATIVE

by continuous asexual budding Adjacent colonies with a shared histocompatibility allele undergo vascular fusion and establish a common blood circulation performing natural transplantation Fused colonies become chimeras often with complete somatic replacement of the host cell genotype by the fused parabiont We attempted to establish a radioprotection assay for the somatic stem cells that induce chimerism in Botryllus We demonstrate over a range of radiation doses that neither autologous nor allogeneic cell transplantation enhances survival of host colonies This suggests that high mitotic index associated with continuous asexual development leads to radiosensitivity of organs and structures essential to survival during engraftment We observe that radiation induces uncontrolled

skeletal muscle of donor markers derived from unfractionated bone marrow BM cells or from highly purified hematopoietic stem cells HSCs we evaluated myofiber chimerism of multiple muscle groups in irradiated and transplanted recipient mice and in unirradiated parabiotic animals Uninjured panniculus carnosus diaphragm and abdominal muscles infrequently incorporated donor markers into myofibers in a subset of animals after either BM or HSC transplantation however acute muscle injury was essential to elicit contributions to triceps surae TS and tibialis anterior muscles The low level of incorporation of donor myofibers could not be enhanced either by transplantation into newborn recipients or by induced migration of HSCs into the periphery Analysis of muscle chimerism in unirradiated animals joined surgically by parabiosis revealed that contributions of circulating cells to myofibers in the TS were injury dependent and that at least some circulating cells with the potential to contribute to regenerating muscle derive from BM suggesting that hematoablative preconditioning is not required for such contributions In all cases tested myofibers expressed both and markers suggesting that they arise by fusion into skeletal muscle of cells that can include the progeny of HSCs It is not yet clear whether such events represent a normal myogenic pathway or a pathological

neuroscience and neural repair Previously we combined genetic subtraction and microarray analysis to identify genes enriched in neural progenitor cultures Here we apply a strategy to further stratify the neural progenitor genes In situ hybridization demonstrates expression in the central nervous system germinal zones of 54 clones so identified making them highly relevant for study in brain and neural progenitor development Using microarray analysis we find 73 genes enriched in three neural stem cell NSC populations generated under different conditions We use the custom microarray to identify 38 stemness genes with enriched expression in the three NSC conditions and present in both embryonic stem cells and hematopoietic stem cells However comparison of expression profiles from these stem cell populations indicates that while there is shared gene expression the amount of genetic overlap is no more than what would be expected by chance indicating that different stem cells

myeloproliferative disorder MPD that over time progresses to acute leukemia Both processes are closely associated with the t 9 22 chromosomal translocation that creates the fusion gene in hematopoietic stem cells HSCs and their progeny Chronic myelogenous leukemia is therefore classified as an HSC disorder in which a clone of multipotent HSCs is likely to be malignantly transformed although direct evidence for malignant t 9 22 HSCs is lacking To test whether HSC malignancy is required we generated transgenic mice in which expression of is absent in HSCs and targeted exclusively to myeloid progenitors and their myelomonocytic progeny Four of 13 transgenic founders developed a chronic MPD but only one progressed to blast crisis To address whether additional oncogenic events are required for progression to acute disease we crossed mice to mice Of 18 animals 9 developed acute myeloid leukemias that were transplantable to recipients Taken together these data indicate that a MPD can arise in mice without expression of in HSCs and that additional mutations inhibiting programmed cell death may be critical in the transition of this disease to leukemia View details for DOI

dendritic cells DCs in humans and mice The exact developmental stages at which hematopoietic progenitors express Flt3 are responsive to its ligand and subsequently develop to DCs are not known Here we

These findings provide a definitive map of Flt3 expression in the hematopoietic hierarchy and directly demonstrate that Flt3L can drive DC development along both the lymphoid and myeloid developmental

2003 102 2 Abstract Telomere shortening ultimately limits the replicative life span of cultured human somatic cells Telomeres also shorten during replicative aging in vivo in hematopoietic cells including early hematopoietic progenitors and hematopoietic stem cells HSCs from humans and mice despite readily detectable levels of telomerase in these cells To assess the relevance of telomerase to the replicative capacity of HSCs in vivo we serially transplanted HSCs from and mice until exhaustion and monitored telomere length in HSCs during this process HSCs could be serially transplanted for only 2 rounds whereas HSCs could be serially transplanted for at least 4 rounds Furthermore the rate of telomere shortening was increased approximately during serial transplantation of HSCs These findings suggest that one role for telomerase in the HSC is to partially counter the rate of telomere shortening during division of HSCs thereby preventing premature loss of telomere function and

hematopoietic stem cells HSCs and 6 closely related progenitor populations common myeloid progenitors CMPs progenitors GMPs progenitors MEPs common lymphoid progenitors CLPs and and cells Cluster analysis revealed that nearly half of all differentially expressed transcripts are associated with HSCs supporting the notion of an active transcriptional status of HSCs Genes found enriched in the HSC cluster encompass many developmentally regulated genes some previously associated with HSC In contrast genes that are enriched in committed progenitors are mostly associated with hematopoietic differentiation immune regulation and metabolism Thus the transition from HSCs toward committed progenitors correlates with the of a large number of genes and progressive of a limited number of genes

effectiveness depends on the balance of and proteins in cells Due to the complicated interactions of the many proteins involved it has been difficult to determine in tumors whether overexpression of single genes is prognostic for increased resistance Therefore we studied the influence of overexpression on resistance to chemotherapeutics in a transgenic mouse system This allowed us to study a wide variety of cells including important but rare populations such as hematopoietic stem cells HSC transgenic and WT mice were treated with several agents cyclophosphamide and busulfan to determine the contribution of increased amounts of to the response to these chemotherapeutics in vivo Populations were enumerated using flow cytometry HSC were studied by FACS purification and reconstitution assays in vivo and resistance was confirmed by proliferation assays with different amounts of chemotherapeutics in overexpression alone protects many cell types though protection levels differ between populations and agents However even sensitive populations return to pretreatment levels faster in transgenic mice overexpression also prevents the dramatic changes in HSC following treatment downregulation of upregulation of Lin less efficient reconstitution In vitro studies directly demonstrate increased resistance of overexpressing HSC to chemotherapeutic Increased expression of in HSC and their progeny endows these cells with broad resistance to chemotherapeutic agents The ability to differentially regulate sensitivity to apoptosis of bystander and tumor cells is clinically

the neural crest Wnt proteins are potentially important reagents in expanding specific cell types but in contrast to other developmental signalling molecules such as hedgehog proteins and the bone morphogenetic proteins Wnt proteins have never been isolated in an active form Although Wnt proteins are secreted from cells secretion is usually inefficient and previous attempts to characterize Wnt proteins have been hampered by their high degree of insolubility Here we have isolated active Wnt molecules including the product of the mouse Wnt3a gene By mass spectrometry we found the proteins to be palmitoylated on a conserved cysteine Enzymatic removal of the palmitate or and natural mutations of the modified cysteine result in loss of activity and indicate that the lipid is important for

an important role in this process Overexpression of activated expands the pool of HSCs in cultures by both phenotype and function Furthermore HSCs in their normal microenvironment activate a reporter which indicates that HCSs respond to Wnt signalling in vivo To demonstrate the physiological significance of this pathway for HSC proliferation we show that the ectopic expression of axin or a frizzled domain inhibitors of the Wnt signalling pathway leads to inhibition of HSC growth in vitro and reduced reconstitution in vivo Furthermore activation of Wnt signalling in HSCs induces increased expression of HoxB4 and Notch1 genes previously implicated in of HSCs We conclude that the Wnt signalling pathway is critical for normal HSC homeostasis in vitro and in vivo and provide

Annual Meeting of the Bartl Baish Weissman Diaz OXFORD UNIV PRESS 2003 Abstract The antigen receptors on cells of innate immune systems recognize broadly expressed markers on cells while the receptors on lymphocytes of the adaptive immune system display a higher level of specificity Adaptive immunity with its exquisite specificity and immunological memory has only been found in the jawed vertebrates which also display innate immunity Jawless fishes and invertebrates only have innate immunity In the adaptive immune response T and detect foreign agents or antigens using T cell receptors TCR or immunoglobulins Ig respectively While Ig can bind free intact antigens TCR only binds processed antigenic fragments that are presented on molecules encoded in the major histocompatibility complex MHC MHC molecules display variation through allelic polymorphism A diverse repertoire of Ig and TCR molecules is generated by gene rearrangement and junctional diversity processes carried out by the recombinase activating gene RAG products and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase TdT Thus the molecules that define adaptive immunity are TCR Ig MHC molecules RAG products and TdT No direct predecessors of these molecules have been found in the jawless fishes or invertebrates In contrast the complement cascade can be activated by either adaptive or innate immune systems and contains examples of molecules that gradually evolved from functions to being part of the innate and then adaptive immune system In this paper we examine the molecules of the adaptive immune system and

during aging and after transplantation despite the presence of readily detectable levels of telomerase in these cells In T cells antigenic stimulation has been shown to result in a marked increase in the level of telomerase activity We now show that stimulation of T cells derived from serially transplanted HSC results in a elongation of telomere length to a size similar to that observed in T cells isolated directly from young mice Southern analysis of telomere length in resting and stimulated splenic T cells revealed an increase in telomere size by approximately 7 kb for the population as a whole Stimulation of T cells from recipients of HSCs from mice did not result in regeneration of telomere length demonstrating a dependence on telomerase Furthermore clonal stimulation of T cells followed by fluorescent in situ hybridization FISH analysis of telomeric signal intensity showed that telomeres had increased in size by approximately 50 for all clonal expansions Together these

in which all adult organisms called zooids in a colony die synchronously by apoptosis programmed cell death in cyclical fashion During this death phase called takeover cell corpses within the dying organism are engulfed by circulating phagocytic cells The old zooids and their organs are resorbed within h programmed cell removal This process coincides temporally with the growth of asexually derived primary buds that harbor a small number of undifferentiated cells into mature zooids containing functional organs and tissues with the same body plan as adult zooids from which they budded Within these colonies all zooids share a ramifying network of extracorporeal blood vessels embedded in a gelatinous tunic The underlying mechanisms regulating programmed cell death and programmed cell removal in this organism are unknown In this study we extirpated buds or zooids from schlosseri colonies in order to investigate the interplay that exists between buds zooids and the vascular system during takeover Our findings indicate that in the complete absence of buds budectomy organs from adult zooids underwent programmed cell death but were markedly impaired in their ability to be resorbed despite engulfment of cell corpses by phagocytes However when buds were removed from only half of the systems of zooids in a colony hemibudectomy the budectomized zooids were completely resorbed within h following onset of programmed cell death Furthermore if hemibudectomies were carried out by using small colonies leaving only a single functional bud zooids from the old generation were also resorbed albeit delayed to h following onset of programmed cell death This bud eventually reached functional maturity but grew significantly larger in size than any control zooid and exhibited hyperplasia This finding strongly suggested that components of the dying zooid viscera could be reutilized by the developing buds possibly as part of a recycling mechanism In order to test this hypothesis zooids were surgically removed zooidectomy at the onset of takeover and bud growth was quantitatively determined In these zooidectomized colonies bud growth was severely curtailed In most solitary animals organs and tissues are maintained by processes of continual death and removal of aging cells counterbalanced by regeneration with stem and progenitor cells In the colonial tunicate

HSC actually started with the discovery by Till McCulloch and colleagues that bone marrow contained single cells that could give rise to myeloerythroid colonies in the spleen and sometimes these colonies contained cells that made more spleen colonies as well as radioprotected and reconstituted lethally irradiated mice 3 But in retrospect it should have started with the remarkable observation of Ray Owen in 1945 that bovine fraternal twins sharing a single placenta and blood circulation retained production of blood cells genetically defined to be from both throughout their life 4 It could be argued that this was the experiment that began both modern experimental hematology as well as modern cellular immunology The Till McCulloch Wu Becker and Simonovitch experiments were elegant demonstrations that single genetically marked cells existed random DNA breaks and translocations induced by sublethal irradiation of the donor bone marrow that could both and differentiate 2 5 But these experiments did not put the pure cells in the hands of scientists and so most of their functions for the next 25 years were implied rather than directly analyzed Just as genetics is the complement to biochemistry when one considers genes and gene products cell marking is the complement to cell purification in the fields of developmental and cellular biology The first attempts at such cellular purification came from the of Till McCulloch 6 7 and independently the school of Van Bekkum in the Netherlands 8 But what was lacking in those experiments and at that time were both a comprehensive approach that would take into account the clonal activity of stem cells in both and differentiation to all blood cell outcomes and the tools with which one could separate what turned out to be an extremely rare population in the bone marrow And it was known until much later that most day spleen colonies were the progeny of progenitors not stem cells 9 Two inventions facilitated the technology of purification of HSC the advent of monoclonal antibody technology by Kohler Milstein 10 and the development of the multiparameter fluorescence activated cell sorter by the Herzenberg group 11 My laboratory had established assays for the clonal precursors of T cells and B cells and we had been using the spleen colony clonal assays since the In the late 1970s and early 1980s we began in earnest the search for mouse early hematopoietic progenitors including HSCs The purification of HSCs proved to be much like the purification of an enzyme or a cell surface receptor or a gene Successive enrichments finally led to the isolation of a population which could no longer be subdivided and which contained precursors that read out in all clonal assays as well as in radioprotection of lethally irradiated hosts 17 Our first experiments transplanting single HSC in 1991 and 1992 led to the definitive demonstration that these were indeed HSCs But these experiments and the ideas that led to them were developed in the context of immunology and experimental hematology as they were emerging in the 1950s and 60 This volume of Immunological Reviews is a rich testimony to the kinds of ideas and experiments that at least in retrospect turned out to be critical Many roads were taken but only one ended up at stem cells View details for Web of Science ID 000177588900014 View details

demonstrate here that promiscuous expression of myeloid or lymphoid genes precedes lineage commitment in hematopoiesis Prospectively purified single common myeloid progenitors CMPs coexpress but not lymphoid genes whereas single common lymphoid progenitors CLPs coexpress T and B lymphoid but not myeloid genes Genes unrelated to the adopted lineage are downregulated in bipotent and monopotent descendants of CMPs and CLPs Promiscuous gene expression does not alter the biological potential of multipotent progenitors CMPs with an activated endogenous M lysozyme locus yield normal proportions of colonies and CLPs expressing the cell receptor alpha gene differentiate into normal numbers of B cells Thus the accessibility for multiple myeloid or lymphoid programs promiscuously may allow

and provide the majority of day 8 JOURNAL OF CLINICAL INVESTIGATION Nakorn Traver Weissman Akashi 2002 109 12 Abstract irradiation at the minimal lethal dose causes bone marrow failure and death within days To identify the principal components of the hematopoietic system that are radioprotective we transplanted lethally irradiated mice with purified progenitors common myeloid progenitors CMPs progenitors MEPs or progenitors GMPs Transplanted CMPs gave rise to cells both of the GM series and the series whereas GMPs or MEPs showed reconstitution of only GM or ME cells respectively CMPs and MEPs but not GMPs protected mice in a manner suggesting that erythrocytes platelets or both are the critical effectors of radioprotection Accordingly CMPs and MEPs formed robust colonies in recipient bone marrow and spleen whereas GMPs formed small colonies that rapidly disappeared Direct comparisons of spleen CFU potentials among each progenitor subset showed that MEPs contain the vast majority of day 8 activity suggesting that day 8 are the precursors of radioprotective cell subsets All animals radioprotected for 30 days subsequently survived for at least 6 months and showed only hematopoiesis after 30 days These findings suggest that rare hematopoietic stem cells survive myeloablation that can eventually repopulate irradiated hosts if progenitors transiently rescue ablated

HSC have a finite proliferative lifespan based upon the limited number of times they can be serially transplanted in mice Telomeres have been shown to shorten during the division of many normal somatic cells in humans and the attrition of telomeres has been shown to ultimately cause replicative senescence in vitro for a number of different human cell strains Whereas most human cell types have little to no detectable levels of telomerase activity hematopoietic cells including HSC express low to moderate levels of telomerase and yet telomeres shorten considerably during replicative aging of these cells Here we consider the role telomerase may play in the hematopoietic system as well as the effect that of telomerase reverse transcriptase may have on the replicative capacity of

Given the established roles of chemotactic cytokine chemokine migration of other leukocyte subsets the migration of murine HSC to a large panel of CC and CXC chemokines was investigated HSC migrated only in response to stromal derived the ligand for the CXC chemokine receptor 4 CXCR4 CXCR4 expression by HSC was confirmed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis Surprisingly HSC also expressed mRNA for CCR3 and CCR9 although they failed to migrate to the ligands for these receptors The sharply restricted chemotactic responsiveness of HSC is unique among leukocytes and may be

lymphoid progenitor and thymus proT1 maintain a latent differentiation potential that can be initiated by signals emanating from exogenously expressed receptors In this study we investigate at which developmental stage thymocytes lose this differentiation potential We demonstrate that the next maturational stage after proT1 cells proT2 but not preT TN3 cells can convert cell fate from lymphoid to myeloid in response to ectopic receptor signaling in human transgenic mice It is significant that approximately 10 of clonogenic colonies derived from proT cells of transgenic mice have DJ rearrangement specifically at the Dbeta1 but not Dbeta2 segment in the TCRbeta locus No TCR gene rearrangement is observed in cells from nontransgenic mice suggesting that the cells we observe in this system were truly before stimulation with In addition Dbeta1 and Dbeta2 DJ rearrangement of the TCRbeta gene may be differentially regulated and thus serve as markers for distinct proT cell

intravenous transfer of fluorescently marked adult HSC express high levels of several beta1 integrin family members Following treatment bone marrow HSC selectively downregulate alpha 2 integrin expression and upregulate alpha 5 expression HSC found in the blood following treatment express significantly lower levels of multiple integrins than their bone marrow splenic counterparts Changes in

linked to differences between mouse strains in the numbers of reconstituting HSCs or restricted progenitors in the bone marrow mice had significantly higher frequencies and numbers of both HSCs and restricted progenitors in their bone marrow than mice The alleles were partially dominant A locus on chromosome 17 including the complex was significantly linked to the frequency of HSCs but showed no evidence of linkage to the frequency of restricted progenitors Conversely a chromosome 1 locus exhibited suggestive linkage to restricted progenitor frequencies but was not linked to HSC frequency This demonstrates that there are distinct genetic determinants of the frequencies of HSCs and restricted progenitors in vivo The chromosome 17 locus was not sufficient to increase HSC frequencies when bred onto a C57BL background This suggests that to affect HSC frequencies the product s of this locus likely depend on interactions with unlinked modifying loci View details for Web of Science ID

common lymphoid progenitors and clonogenic common myeloid progenitors CMPs in adult mouse bone marrow that give rise to all lymphoid and myeloid lineages respectively have recently been identified Here it is shown that myelopoiesis in the fetal liver similarly proceeds through a CMP equivalent Fetal liver CMPs give rise to progenitors MEPs and progenitors GMPs that can also be prospectively isolated by cell surface phenotype MEPs and GMPs generate mutually exclusive cell types in clonogenic colony assays and in transplantation experiments suggesting that the lineage restriction observed within each progenitor subset is absolute under normal conditions Purified progenitor populations were used to analyze expression profiles of various genes Expression patterns closely matched those of the adult counterpart populations These results suggest that adult hematopoietic hierarchies are determined early in the development of the definitive immune system and suggest that the molecular

is the product of a originally discovered at the site of chromosomal translocations in acute leukemias It binds DNA as a complex with a broad subset of homeodomain proteins but its contributions to hematopoiesis have not been established This paper reports that Pbx1 is expressed in hematopoietic progenitors during murine embryonic development and that its absence results in severe anemia and embryonic lethality at embryonic day 15 E15 or E16 Definitive myeloerythroid lineages are present in Pbx1 fetal livers but the total numbers of cells are substantially reduced Fetal liver hypoplasia reflects quantitative as well as qualitative defects in the most primitive multilineage progenitors and their progeny Hematopoietic stem cells from Pbx1 embryos have reduced activity and are unable to establish multilineage hematopoiesis in competitive reconstitution experiments Common myeloid progenitors CMPs the earliest known progenitors are markedly depleted in Pbx1 embryos at E14 and display clonogenic defects in erythroid colony formation Comparative indexes suggest that these defects result largely from insufficient proliferation and progenitors are also reduced in number and show decreased erythroid potential Taken together these data indicate that Pbx1 is essential for the function of hematopoietic progenitors with erythropoietic potential and that its loss creates a proliferative constriction at the level of the CMP Thus Pbx1 is required for the maintenance but not the initiation of definitive hematopoiesis and contributes to the mitotic amplifications of progenitor subsets through which mature erythrocytes are generated Blood 2001 View details for Web of Science ID 000170094800021 View details for PubMedID 11468159 From hematopoiesis to neuropoiesis

is reasonable to propose that gene expression profiles of purified stem cells could give clues for the molecular mechanisms of stem cell behavior We took advantage of cDNA subtraction to identify a set of genes selectively expressed in mouse adult hematopoietic stem cells HSC as opposed to bone marrow BM Analysis of genes revealed several key regulatory gene candidates including two novel seven transmembrane 7TM receptors Furthermore by using cDNA microarray techniques we found a large set of genes that are expressed in mouse neurospheres a population greatly enriched for neural progenitor cells but not present in terminally differentiated neural cells In situ hybridization demonstrated that many of them including one 7TM receptor were selectively expressed in the germinal zones of fetal and adult brain the regions harboring mouse neural stem cells We propose that at least some of the transcripts that are selectively and commonly expressed in two or more types of stem cells

overall contributions to the DC compartment are evaluated It has previously been shown that primitive progenitors common myeloid progenitors CMPs are efficient precursors of both CD8alpha and CD8alpha DCs in vivo Here it is shown that the earliest progenitors common lymphoid progenitors CLPs and CMPs and their progeny progenitors GMPs can give rise to functional DCs in vitro and in vivo CLPs are more efficient in generating DCs than their descendants the early thymocyte progenitors and cells and CMPs are more efficient DC precursors than the descendant GMPs whereas cells and progenitors are incapable of generating DCs Thus DC developmental potential is preserved during but not differentiation from CLP and during but not development from CMP In vivo reconstitution experiments show that CLPs and CMPs can reconstitute CD8alpha and CD8alpha DCs with similar efficiency on a per cell basis However CMPs are more numerous than CLPs suggesting that at steady state CLPs provide only a minority of splenic DCs and approximately half the DCs in thymus whereas most DCs including CD8alpha and CD8alpha subtypes are of myeloid origin Blood 2001 View details for Web of Science ID

length can lead to the prevention of replicative senescence in some human somatic cells grown in vitro To investigate whether telomere shortening might also play a role in the limitation of hematopoietic stem cell HSC division capacity in vivo we analyzed telomere length during serial transplantation of murine HSCs Southern blot analysis of telomere length in donor bone marrow cells revealed extensive shortening approximately 7 kb after just two rounds of HSC transplantation The number of cycling HSCs increased after transplantation and remained elevated for at least 4 mo while the frequency of HSCs in the bone marrow was completely regenerated by 2 mo after transplantation Direct analysis of telomeres in HSCs by fluorescent in situ hybridization during serial transplantation also revealed a reduction in telomere size Together these data show that telomeres shorten during division of HSCs in vivo and are consistent with the hypothesis that telomere

are widely used for transplantation in the treatment of malignancies but the mechanism of HSC mobilization is unclear Although many HSC in bone marrow BM cycle rapidly and expand their numbers in response to cytoreductive agents such as cyclophosphamide CY and cytokines such as granulocyte factor MPB HSC are almost all in the G 0 or G 1 phase of the cell cycle This has raised the question of whether a subset of noncycling BM HSC is selectively released or whether cycling BM HSC are mobilized after M phase but before the next S phase of the cell cycle To distinguish between these possibilities mice were treated with one dose of CY followed by daily doses of and dividing cells were marked by administration of bromodeoxyuridine BrdU during the interval that BM HSC are expanding

Abstract The promyelocytic leukemia retinoic acid receptor alpha PMLRARalpha chimeric protein is associated with acute promyelocytic leukemia APL PMLRARalpha transgenic mice develop leukemia only after several months suggesting that PMLRARalpha does not by itself confer a fully malignant phenotype Suppression of apoptosis can have a central role in tumorigenesis therefore we assessed whether influenced the ability of PMLRARalpha to initiate leukemia Evaluation of preleukemic animals showed that whereas PMLRARalpha alone modestly altered neutrophil maturation the combination of PMLRARalpha and caused a marked accumulation of immature myeloid cells in bone marrow Leukemias developed more rapidly in mice coexpressing PMLRARalpha and than in mice expressing PMLRARalpha alone and all mice expressing both transgenes succumbed to leukemia by 7 mo Although both preleukemic doubly transgenic mice and leukemic animals had abundant promyelocytes in the bone marrow only leukemic mice

differentiation are not well understood We have used microarrays derived from a representational difference analysis RDA subtraction in a heterogeneous stem cell culture system to systematically study the gene expression patterns of CNS progenitors This analysis identified both known and novel genes enriched in progenitor cultures In situ hybridization in a subset of clones demonstrated that many of these genes were expressed preferentially in germinal zones some showing distinct ventricular or subventricular zone labeling Several genes were also enriched in hematopoietic stem cells suggesting an overlap of gene expression in neural and hematopoietic progenitors This combination of methods demonstrates the power of using custom microarrays derived from libraries for both gene discovery and

has been isolated from a highly purified population of mouse hematopoietic stem cells and designated RGS18 It has 234 amino acids consisting of a central RGS box and short divergent NH 2 and COOH termini The calculated molecular weight of RGS18 is and the isoelectric point is Mouse RGS18 is expressed from a single gene and shows tissue specific distribution It is most highly expressed in bone marrow followed by fetal liver spleen and then lung In bone marrow RGS18 level is highest in and hematopoietic stem cells and is decreased as they differentiate into more committed multiple progenitors The human RGS18 ortholog has a expression pattern similar to that of mouse RGS18 Purified RGS18 interacts with the alpha subunit of both G i and G q subfamilies The results of in vitro GTPase assays using Galpha i indicated that RGS18 accelerates the intrinsic GTPase activity of Galpha i Transient overexpression of RGS18 attenuated inositol phosphates production via angiotensin receptor and transcriptional activation through element via M1 muscarinic receptor This suggests RGS18 can act on G q signaling pathways in vivo View details for Web of Science ID 000166430900009 View

Abstract Multipotent stem cells are clonal cells that as well as differentiate to regenerate adult tissues Whereas stem cells and their fates are known by unique genetic marker studies the fate and function of these cells are best studied by their prospective isolation This review is about the properties of various highly purified multipotent stem cells and purified oligolineage progenitors We contend that unless the stem or progenitor cells in question have been purified to near homogeneity one can not know whether their generation of expected or unexpected progeny is a property of a known cell type It is interesting that in the hematopoietic system the only cells in the stem and progenitors pool are the hematopoietic stem cells This fact is discussed in the context of normal and

multicellular multiparameter systems Yet this is essential to understand the impact on cells like hematopoietic stem cells HSCs which have strict and still poorly understood growth factor requirements Single cell plating in medium allows direct assessment of growth factor responses The range of tested factors can be expanded if the cells are protected from growth factor apoptosis is overexpressed in HSCs of transgenic mice protecting them from many apoptotic stimuli The response of single and transgenic HSCs to stimulations with individual factors was tested Surprisingly we find that high level expression does not prevent rapid death under conditions even though it does in the presence of serum We also find that transgenic but not cells survive and proliferate rapidly in response to steel factor Kit ligand These studies show that two separate signals are necessary to prevent apoptosis in HSCs and that Kit ligand by itself provides a strong proliferative stimulus to HSCs However

only rigorously purified hematopoietic stem cells gave rise to hematopoietic and hepatic regeneration This result seems to contradict the conventional assumptions of the germ layer origins of tissues

can be redirected to the myeloid lineage by stimulation through exogenously expressed interleukin IL and factor receptors Analysis of mutants of the of the receptor revealed that the and signals are triggered by different cytoplasmic domains showing that the signalling pathway s responsible for these unique developmental outcomes are separable Finally we show that the endogenous myelomonocytic

allogeneic bone marrow BM has been shown to induce tolerance to organs genotypically matched with the BM donor Immune reconstitution after BM transplantation therefore involves of a T cell pool tolerant to antigens present on both donor and host tissues However how hematopoietic grafts exert their influence over the regenerating immune system is not completely understood Prior studies suggest that education of the newly arising T cell pool involves distinct contributions from donor and host stromal elements Specifically negative selection is thought to be mediated primarily by donor cells whereas positive selection is dictated by thymic stromal cells In this report we studied the effect of highly purified allogeneic hematopoietic stem cells HSCs on organ transplantation tolerance induction and immune reconstitution In contrast to engraftment of BM that results in donor T cell chimerism HSC engraftment results in mixed T cell chimerism Nonetheless we observed that HSC grafts induce tolerance to neonatal heart grafts and one way the HSC grafts alter host immune responses is via deletion of newly arising donor as well as host T cells Furthermore using an in vivo assay of graft rejection to study positive selection we made the unexpected observation that T cells in chimeric mice rejected grafts only in the context of the donor MHC type These latter findings

promise for the treatment of many hematologic disorders One major variable that has limited the overall success of gene therapy to date is the lack of sustained gene expression from viral vectors in transduced stem cell populations To understand the basis for reduced gene expression at a level we have used a murine retroviral vector MFG that expresses the green fluorescent protein GFP to transduce purified populations of hematopoietic stem cells isolated using the cell sorter Limiting dilution reconstitution of lethally irradiated recipient mice with 100 transduced GFP showed that silencing of gene expression occurred rapidly in most integration events at the level irrespective of the initial levels of GFP expression When inactivation occurred at the level there was no GFP expression in any hematopoietic lineage clonally derived from silenced Inactivation downstream of that stably expressed GFP in reconstituted animals was restricted primarily to lymphoid cells These

BIOLOGICAL BULLETIN Lauzon Rinkevich Patton Weissman 2000 198 3 Abstract Botryllus schlosseri is a clonally modular ascidian in which individuals zooids have a finite life span that is intimately associated with a weekly budding process called blastogenesis Every blastogenic cycle concludes with a synchronized phase of regression called takeover during which all zooids in a colony die primarily by apoptosis and are replaced by a new generation of asexually derived zooids We have previously documented that in addition to this cyclical death phase entire colonies undergo senescence during which all asexually derived individuals in a colony buds and zooids die in concert In addition when a specific parent colony genet is experimentally separated into a number of clonal replicates ramets ramets frequently undergo senescence simultaneously indicating that mortality can manifest itself in nonrandom fashion Here we document a morphological portrait of senescence in colonies from Monterey Bay California that exhibit nonrandom mortality Nonrandom senescence proceeded according to a series of characteristic changes within the colony over a period of about one week These changes included systemic constriction and congestion of the vasculature accompanied by massive accumulation of pigment cells in the zooid body wall mantle blood vessels and ampullae gradual shrinkage of individual zooids loss of colonial architecture and ultimately death At the ultrastructural level individual cells exhibited changes typical of ischemic cell death culminating in necrotic cell lysis rather than apoptosis Collectively these observations indicate that senescence is accompanied by unique morphological changes that occur systemically and which are distinct from those occurring during takeover We discuss our findings in relation to current experimental models of aging and the possible role of a humoral factor in bringing about the onset of senescence View details for Web of Science

distinct pgc and psc can compete for access to developing gonads and somatic organs and that this competition is hierarchical reproducible and heritable Given that a single highly polymorphic locus controls whether two contacting colonies fuse or reject our findings also support a leading hypothesis for why the highly polymorphic histocompatibility loci common to many metazoa may have arisen or

1999 5 5 Abstract Hematopoietic stem cells HSCs are the rare cells from which all hematopoietic cells are derived The absence of HSCs is not compatible with life because many essential cells such as myeloid and erythroid cells are short lived The hematopoietic system is the first essential organ system that fails following cytotoxic treatments It is the vulnerability of HSCs that prevents regeneration following treatment and thus survival Because HSCs have the capacity to regenerate a functional hematopoietic system the manipulation of these cells in vitro holds many promises for and other applications however these are severely curtailed by current difficulties in maintaining and expanding HSCs in culture This review focuses on recent approaches towards understanding how the HSC compartment is regulated in vivo and discusses how this knowledge might be applied to manipulating HSC numbers View details for Web of Science ID 000081646700007 View details for PubMedID 10322312 In

1999 167 Abstract The MHC molecules have been historically perceived as transplantation antigens though it is now recognized that their primary if not sole role is in eliminating parasites and in surveillance and clearance of aberrant self Indeed pregnancy in mammals would represent the closest to a natural transplantation process that occurs in vertebrates However among the immediate ancestors to the vertebrates natural intraspecific allorecognition processes are common Among members of the colonial tunicate Botryllus schlosseri two individuals that share a single allele of the highly polymorphic locus are able to fuse with one another Could this be related to the MHC such that the MHC really did have its origins as a transplantation antigen Presently we review the genetics and biology of natural transplantation processes in colonial tunicates comparing it with allorecognition as mediated through the vertebrate receptor killer cell inhibitory and MHC Experimental approaches to determining if the molecules regulating allorecognition in tunicates have any ancestral relationship to the vertebrate MHC are discussed as is a genomic approach to isolating novel mediators of allorecognition We also explore the biological basis for allorecognition in colonial tunicates and recent work that highlights the costs of not maintaining a system for allorecognition

colonial urochordate Botryllus schlosseri undergoes a genetically defined natural transplantation reaction that is controlled by a single Mendelian locus called the This allorecognition system is initiated when peripheral elements of the vasculature interact on the edges of two asexually expanding colonies To better understand the spatial organization of the cellular elements responsible for allorecognition we bypassed the normal site of interaction the ampullae and experimentally transplanted zooids between Botryllus schlosseri pairs The results show that 1 instead of the expected rejections tissue necroses that develop after natural contacts between peripheral blood vessels the transplanted organs are morphologically eliminated within a few days in conjunction with the normal blastogenic cycle and 2 chimerism is established after complete morphological elimination of transplanted tissues These results suggest that allorecognition responses in Botryllus schlosseri occur exclusively at the ampullae and that once cells have crossed this barrier they are able to survive and proliferate in the new host colony View details for Web of Science ID 000076917600002 View

circulating neutrophils their bone marrow contained increased numbers of immature neutrophilic cells which exhibited abnormal characteristics In addition PEBP2betaMYH11 inhibited neutrophilic differentiation in colonies derived from hematopoietic progenitors Coexpression of both PEBP2betaMYH11 and activated NRAS induced a more severe phenotype characterized by abnormal nuclear morphology

encode proteins that permit transport of the viral genome into the nucleus of nondividing cells We and others have recently demonstrated efficient transduction by using an vector gene delivery system into various human cell types including human CD34 cells or terminally differentiated neurons Here we compare the transduction efficiency of two vectors and murine leukemia virus MuLV vectors on untreated and highly purified human HSC subsets that are virtually all in The HIV vector but not MuLV vector supernatants transduced freshly isolated HSC from mobilized peripheral blood transduction using HIV resulted in HSC that expressed the green fluorescent protein GFP transgene while retaining their stem cell phenotype clonal outgrowths of these HSC on bone marrow stromal cells fully retained GFP expression for at least 5 weeks vectors did not transduce resting HSC as measured by transgene expression but did so readily when the HSC were actively cycling after culture in vitro for

differentiation remains controversial Here we show that CD40 engagement arrests B cell differentiation prior to plasma cell formation This arrest is manifested at a molecular level as a reduction in mRNA levels of secretory immunoglobulin gene products such as mu s and J chain as well as the loss of the transcriptional regulator Furthermore the inhibition of B cell differentiation by CD40 engagement could not be overcome by either mitogens or cytokines but could be reversed by antibodies that interfere with the interaction These data suggest that secretory immunoglobulin is not

Tomaso Saito Ishizuka Palmeri Weissman 1998 149 1 Abstract The colonial protochordate Botryllus schlosseri undergoes a genetically defined natural transplantation reaction when the edges of two growing colonies interact Peripheral blood vessels of each colony touch and will either fuse together to form a common vasculature between the colonies or reject each other in an active inflammatory process in which the interacting vessels are cut off and the two colonies no longer interact Previous studies have demonstrated that allorecognition in Botryllus is principally controlled by a single Mendelian locus named the locus with multiple codominantly expressed alleles However identification and cloning of this locus has been difficult We are taking a genomic approach in isolating this locus by creating a detailed genetic linkage map of the 725 Mbp Botryllus genome using DNA polymorphisms primarily identified as AFLPs as molecular genetic markers DNA polymorphisms are identified in inbred laboratory strains of defined Botryllus and their segregation and linkage is analyzed in a series of defined crosses Using bulk segregant analysis we have focused our mapping efforts on the

Helios a T Ikaros family member that quantitatively associates with Ikaros at centromeric heterochromatin GENES DEVELOPMENT Hahm Cobb McCarty Brown Klug LEE Akashi Weissman Fisher Smale 1998 12 6 Abstract The Ikaros gene encodes multiple protein isoforms that contribute critical functions during the development of lymphocytes and other hematopoietic cell types The intracellular functions of Ikaros are not known although recent studies have shown that Ikaros proteins colocalize with inactive genes and centromeric heterochromatin In this study Ikaros proteins were found to be components of highly stable complexes The complexes from an immature T cell line were purified revealing associated proteins of 70 and 30 kD The p70 gene named Helios encodes two protein isoforms with zinc finger domains exhibiting considerable homology to those within Ikaros proteins Helios and Ikaros recognize similar DNA sequences and when overexpressed Helios associates indiscriminately with the various Ikaros isoforms Although Ikaros is present in most hematopoietic cells Helios was found primarily in T cells The relevance of the interaction in T cells is supported by the quantitative association of Helios with a fraction of the Ikaros Interestingly the complexes localize to the centromeric regions of T cell nuclei similar to the Ikaros localization previously observed in B cells Unlike the B cell results however only a fraction of the Ikaros presumably the fraction associated with Helios exhibited centromeric localization in T cells These results establish immunoaffinity chromatography as a useful method for identifying Ikaros partners and suggest that Helios is a limiting regulatory subunit for Ikaros within centromeric heterochromatin View details for Web of Science ID

blood Allogeneic BM transplants show a further delay in engraftment and have an apparent requirement for donor T cells to facilitate engraftment In mice lo hematopoietic stem cells HSCs are the principal population in BM which is responsible for engraftment in syngeneic hosts at radioprotective doses and higher doses of HSCs can radioprotect an allogeneic host in the absence of donor T cells Using the mouse as a preclinical model we wished to test to what extent engraftment kinetics was a function of HSC content and whether at high doses of lo KTLS cells rapid allogeneic engraftment could also be achieved Here we demonstrate that engraftment kinetics varied greatly over the range of KTLS doses tested cells with the most rapid engraftment being obtained with a dose of or more syngeneic cells Mobilized splenic KTLS cells and the rhodamine 123 lo subset of KTLS cells were also able to engraft rapidly Higher doses of allogeneic cells were needed to produce equivalent engraftment kinetics This suggests that in mice even fully allogeneic barriers can be traversed with high doses of HSCs and that in humans it may be possible to obtain rapid engraftment in an allogeneic context

solid organ grafts Clinical application of bone marrow transplantation in solid organ transplantation has been limited however principally by disease We previously demonstrated that hematopoietic stem cells HSCs reconstitute lethally irradiated allogeneic mice without producing disease The purpose of this study was to determine whether tolerance to solid organ grafts could be induced in mice reconstituted with mice were lethally irradiated and reconstituted with allogeneic WBM or HSCs An isolated group was given a limited number of HSCs 250 cells and a subpopulation of allogeneic cells known to facilitate HSC engraftment facilitators neonatal heart grafts were placed in reconstituted animals either at the time of hematopoietic transplant or 35 days later C3H grafts were placed over 2 months after hematopoietic reconstitution Tolerance was defined as the persistence of cardiac contraction for the duration of evaluation days surviving mice that were reconstituted with HSCs WBM or HSCs and facilitators were tolerant of grafts C3H grafts placed in reconstituted animals were rejected by day 12 whereas those placed in unmanipulated mice were rejected by day data indicate that

Abstract The generation of lymphoid cells in mice depends on the function of the Ikaros protein Ikaros has been characterized as a transcription factor that is derived from an alternatively spliced message Ikaros knockout mice have defects in multiple cell lineages raising the question of whether the protein regulates multiple committed progenitors multipotent stem cells To address this issue we examined Ikaros expression in purified populations of multipotent cells and more committed progenitors We found that the isoforms of Ikaros were localized in the nucleus of the most primitive hematopoietic stem cell subset Changes in the RNA splicing pattern of Ikaros occurred at two stages i as stem cells differentiated into stem cells and ii as multipotent progenitors differentiated into progenitors Unexpectedly we found Ikaros localized to heterochromatin in lymphocytes by using immunogold electron microscopy These observations suggest a complex role for Ikaros in lymphoid

characteristics attributed to resting hematopoietic stem cells but does not reconstitute irradiated mice These cells express high levels of and CD38 and low levels of but do not express CD34 nor any of the lineage markers including CD3 CD4 CD5 CD8 B220 Ig MGA CD40 kappa or Ter119 In addition this population can be found at normal frequency in as well as mice These cells incorporate only low levels of Rh123 are resistant to the cytotoxic effects of and consistent with their resting phenotype less than 2 of these cells are in the phases of the cell cycle The only phenotypic characteristic that distinguishes these cells from the reconstituting hematopoietic stem cell population is their lack of expression Here we have explored the possibility that these cells represent a truly resting population of hematopoietic stem cells We found that the cells do not respond to hematopoietic growth factors in vitro either alone or in combination with stromal layers Furthermore these cells do not form in vivo spleen colonies nor do they have the ability to reconstitute irradiated mice Thus this population may represent either a population of resting stem cells for which we lack the appropriate activating stimulus or simply represent a mystery population that phenotypically mimics most of the physical properties of resting stem cells Given the close phenotypic similarity of the mystery population cells to the reconstituting stem cells investigators must be rigorous to exclude their effects from other stem cell assays View details for Web of Science ID 000071663000006 View details

subclasses The forced expression of restored all stages of T lymphopoiesis but not B or NK cell development indicating that a primary function of gamma c signals in the T lineage might be to maintain cell survival Therefore the development of T B and NK cells may be influenced by distinct intracytoplasmic signaling cascades that are activated by coupling of gamma c receptors View details for Web

Abstract Osteopetrotic mice lack functional and have depressed levels of macrophages and osteoclasts We prepared transgenic mice that express human in monocytes In vitro monocytes do not undergo apoptosis in the absence of serum and while and monocytes die These monocytes spontaneously undergo macrophage differentiation In vivo the mice show significant replenishment of tissue macrophages Their long bone osteopetrosis is largely reversed and extensive medullary hematopoiesis appears in the bone marrow We propose that augments monocyte survival permitting them to respond to internal and

which is thought to eliminate many of the rapidly dividing more committed progenitors in the bone marrow and to provide a relatively enriched population of the most primitive hematopoietic progenitor cells Although differences between progenitor populations and those from normal bone marrow have been described it remained unclear if these differences reflected characteristics of the most primitive stem cells that were revealed by or if there were changes in the population itself Here we have examined some of the properties of the stem cells in the bone marrow before and after treatment and have defined several changes in the population We found that reconstituting stem cells decrease their expression of the growth factor receptor by and increase their expression of the integrin CD11b These changes begin as early as 24 hours after treatment and are most pronounced within 2 to 3 days This activated phenotype of HSCs isolated from mice is similar to the phenotype of stem cells found in the fetal liver and to the phenotype of transiently repopulating progenitors in normal bone marrow We found that cell cycle is induced concomitantly with these physical changes and within 2 days as many as 29 of the population is in the phases of the cell cycle Furthermore when examined at a clonal level we found that did not appear to eliminate many of the transient multipotent progenitors from the bone marrow that were found to be copurified with repopulating activated stem cells These results demonstrate the sensitivity of the hematopoietic system to changes in its homeostasis and correlate

subpopulations of lo Lin cells reconstituting cells and transiently reconstituting lo or lo CD4 lo cells This study shows that the same populations with similar functional activities exist in mice whose hematopoietic systems were reconstituted by hematopoietic stem cells after lethal irradiation We demonstrate that these populations form a lineage of multipotent progenitors from stem cells to the most mature multipotent progenitor population In reconstituted mice cells gave rise to lo cells which gave rise to lo CD4 lo cells cells had potential with each cell being capable of giving rise to more than 10 4 functionally similar cells At least half of lo cells had transient potential detected in the spleen 7 days after reconstitution lo CD4 lo cells did not have detectable potential The

maturation early in life which progressed at a low frequency over the course of several months to overt APL Both the preleukemic state and the leukemia could be transplanted to nontransgenic mice and the transplanted preleukemia could progress to APL The APL recapitulated features of the human disease including a response to retinoic acid Retinoic acid caused the leukemic cells to differentiate in vitro and in vivo eliciting remissions of both the preleukemic state and APL in mice Our results demonstrate that PMLRAR alpha impairs neutrophil differentiation and initiates the development of APL

multipotent progenitor activity was contained in two populations lo reconstituting progenitors and lo lo transiently reconstituting progenitors treatment drove both and transient multipotent progenitors into cycle leading to a more than expansion in the number of HSC prior to mobilization After CY and 2 days of treatment the number of bone marrow HSC began to decline and the number of blood and splenic HSC increased HSC continued to proliferate in the bone marrow and spleen through 8 days of treatment but HSC released into the blood tended to be in phase Mobilized multipotent progenitors isolated from the spleen were less efficient than normal bone marrow multipotent progenitors in engrafting irradiated mice but did not differ in colony forming activity or single cell in vitro assays of primitive progenitor activity The data suggest that mobilized HSC isolated from the spleen are less efficient at homing to and engrafting the bone marrow of irradiated recipient mice

Upon contact colonies either fuse or reject one another in a manner resembling graft acceptance or rejection in vertebrates This response is controlled by a single highly polymorphic genetic region the FuHC locus Colonial protochordates such as schlosseri are among the closest relatives of the vertebrate lineage and therefore may possess a recognizable MHC homologue Since linkage between heat shock protein 70 HSP70 genes and MHC appears to be conserved within the vertebrate lineage we have analyzed HSP70 genes from schlosseri as a first step toward isolating the historecognition locus Two HSP70 genes and have been cloned and sequenced and exhibit sequence identity within the predicted coding regions The schlosseri genes share a number of characteristics with vertebrate HSP70 genes Northern blotting and sequence analysis suggest that the protochordate genes are members of the HSP70 gene family FAGAN and WEISSMAN 1996 However unlike vertebrate HSP70 genes and are not closely linked FAGAN and WEISSMAN 1997 Furthermore neither is closely linked to the locus determining historecognition FAGAN and WEISSMAN 1997 These results do not support the hypothesis that the schlosseri

histocompatibility locus called is responsible for rejection versus fusion Gonads are seeded and gametogenesis can occur in colonies well after fusion and involves circulating progenitors Buss proposed that colonial organisms might develop histocompatibility systems to limit the possibility of interindividual germ cell parasitism GCP to histocompatible kin Buss 1982 Proc Natl Acad Sci USA

common occurrence in fused chimeras These experiments support the tenet in Buss hypothesis that germ cell and somatic cell parasitism can occur in fused chimeras and that a somatic appearance may mask the winner of a gametic war They also provide an interesting challenge to develop formulas that describe the inheritance of competing germ lines rather than competing individuals The fact that fused schlosseri have higher rates of GCP than unfused colonies additionally provides a rational explanation for the generation and maintenance of a high degree of polymorphism largely limiting GCP to

young and mice rarely were in the phases of the cell cycle but HSCs in old mice were frequently in cycle We speculate that the unexpected proliferation of HSCs in old mice might be related to the

IDDM is a chronic inflammatory disease in which there is destruction of the in the pancreatic islets of Langerhans The migration of autoreactive lymphocytes and other leukocytes from the bloodstream into the target organ is of clear importance in the etiology of many disorders including IDDM In IDDM this migration results in lymphocytic invasion of the islets formation of insulitis and subsequent destruction of Migration of lymphocytes from the bloodstream into tissues is a complex process involving sequential adhesion and activation events This migration is controlled in part by selective expression and functional regulation of cell adhesion molecules CAMs on the surface of lymphocytes and vascular endothelial cells or in the extracellular matrix Understanding the mechanisms that regulate lymphocyte migration to the pancreatic islets will lead to further understanding of the pathogenesis of IDDM In this article we summarize the recent advances regarding the function of CAMs in

Heterogeneity of N insertion capacity in fetal hematopoietic stem cells INTERNATIONAL IMMUNOLOGY Komagata Weissman Ikuta 1996 8 6 Abstract TCR gene rearrangement is strictly regulated during mouse ontogeny The D junctions of alphabeta and gammadelta TCR transcripts expressed in the adult thymus are more highly diverse than those in the fetal thymus We previously showed that adult hematopoietic stem cells HSC have a higher capacity to insert N nucleotides into Vgamma4 TCR transcripts than fetal HSC and that the level of N nucleotide insertion is determined at least in part at the level of HSC To analyze this developmental change of HSC at the single cell level we investigated N nucleotide insertions in three TCR transcripts Vgamma4 Vgamma2 and Vbeta8 derived from limiting numbers of fetal liver HSC by fetal thymic organ culture Eight fetal liver HSC clones showed various levels of N nucleotide insertions in Vgamma transcripts On the other hand the level of N insertions was similarly regulated in Vgamma4 Vgamma2 and Vbeta8 TCR transcripts in a way These results suggested that the level of N insertion is programmed at the level of single HSC and that fetal liver contains a heterogeneous population of HSC in terms of N insertion capacity After 3 weeks culture with a stromal cell line fetal HSC showed higher levels of N insertion capacity than before culture This result and the presence of HSC with intermediate N insertion capacity support the hypothesis that the developmental potential of individual HSC gradually changes from fetal to adult type in one stem cell

fraction of hematopoietic tissues It has been demonstrated that lo Lin cells are the only HSCs in bone marrow In this study we separated bone marrow cells by counterflow centrifugal elutriation CCE

Transplantation of purified hematopoietic stem cells requirements for overcoming the barriers of allogeneic engraftment Biology of blood and marrow transplantation Shizuru J Jerabek Edwards Weissman 1996 2 1 Abstract Allogeneic bone marrow transplantation currently plays a critical role in the treatment of leukemias and inherited disorders of hematopoiesis and it shows great promise for the treatment of numerous other diseases The problems of disease GVHD and failure to engraft however remain formidable obstacles to the widespread use of this therapy Successful transplantation of purified populations of hematopoietic stem cells HSCs can theoretically avoid the problem of GVHD since purified HSCs lack the mature elements that allow the graft to mount a response against the host In previous studies from our laboratory a population of purified HSCs was isolated from mouse bone marrow BM These cells represent approximately of BM cells and are capable of and reconstitution of all blood lineages Here we report engraftment of these purified HSCs transplanted in mice across successively more difficult barriers Transplantation of purified HSCs were quantitatively compared with whole bone marrow WBM grafts containing equivalent numbers of stem cells The mouse strain combinations tested were parent transplanted into F1 Hh disparate minor histocompatibility complex mHC and major histocompatibility complex MHC plus mHC disparities One of the recipient strains studied for transplantations was that of spontaneously autoimmune diabetic mice Recipient mice were administered lethal doses of irradiation in the presence or absence of antibodies directed against natural killer NK determinants monoclonal antibodies against the T cell subset We find that as the barrier to transplantation increases greater numbers of HSCs are required for radioprotection and engraftment In all cases stable hematopoietic chimeras were generated with HSCs alone but times the number of HSCs was required for radioprotection of mice transplanted across allogeneic or semiallogeneic disparities as compared to congenic differences Furthermore we demonstrate a clear advantage of WBM vs HSCs with regard to tha ability to engraft corrected Chimeric mice showed no symptoms of GVHD and their T cells were unable to induce GVHD in neonatal mice expressing antigens of donor and host These data confirm that a cell population resident in WBM and distinct from purified stem cells is important in facilitating hematopoietic engraftment in this case of purified allogeneic HSCs The differences in engraftment between WBM and HSCs could be reduced significantly by the addition of antibodies directed against NK determinants to the host preparative regimen Similarly since antibodies directed against host antigens can reduce the barrier to allogeneic HSC engraftment an interaction between the facilitating population within donated WBM and a resistant host population with NK determinants is implied View details for PubMedID 9078349 Sequence and characterization of two HSP70 genes in the colonial protochordate Botryllus schlosseri IMMUNOGENETICS Fagan Weissman 1996 44 2

alpha 4 beta 1 WEHI 231 and alpha 4 beta 7 positive cells are strikingly similar but nonidentical under multiple adhesion activity states By mutagenesis of domain 1 of the amino acid residues on the loop between beta strands C and D R36 Q38 I39 D40 P42 and on the adjacent antiparallel beta strand F L70 and T72 were required for basal level adhesion to both alpha 4 beta and alpha 4 beta cells Mutation at two other sites N44 loop between beta strands C and D and E66 loop between beta strands E and F specifically reduced alpha 4 beta cell adhesion but not alpha 4 beta cell adhesion Mutation H85A augmented alpha 4 beta 7 binding but not alpha 4 beta 1 binding These apparent differences relate to the higher intrinsic activity state of alpha 4 beta 1 on WEHI 231 than on alpha 4 beta 7 In contrast under higher adhesion activity states induced by either MnCl2 or truncation of the beta 7 cytoplasmic tail mutation of either amino acid residue D40 or L70 completely blocked cell adhesion without evidence of structural perturbation of These results suggested that the two structurally discontinuous amino acid residues the negatively charged D40 and the hydrophobic L70 adjacently located

received planktonic food continuously In the field chimaeras grew rapidly attained large sizes and produced many eggs They formed compact colonies in which genotypic composition remained stable throughout their lifespan In most cases genotypic partners in field chimaeras senesced and died synchronously We also cultured genetically identical replicates of the same chimaeras under laboratory conditions where they were fed once daily In the laboratory environment chimaeras grew slowly shrank and fragmented Most genotypes in chimaeric colonies produced significantly fewer zooids and eggs in the laboratory than they did in the field Somatic cell parasitism in the form of resorption of tissues of one genotype by the other occurred mainly in the laboratory environment and not in the field The phenomenon of resorption may thus be a dispensible strategy of fused genotypes depending on environmental conditions Genotypes in field chimaeras may grow and reproduce rapidly because of the food

undergo release of cytoplasmic cytotoxic granule contents to the extracellular space upon stimulation with MoAbs or susceptible target cells Maximal granule release was observed from the subset of effector cells The cytoplasmic granule contents are lytic to target cells Treatment of the effector cells with a analog of cyclic adenosine monophosphate cAMP inhibited MoAb and target degranulation

92 22 Abstract We have generated transgenic mice bearing the diphtheria toxin A chain DTA gene under the control of granzyme A GrA promoter sequences GrA is expressed in activated cytotoxic cells but not in their immediate progenitors These mice are deficient in cytotoxic functions indicating that most cytotoxic cells express GrA in vivo Surprisingly one founder strain containing a multicopy insert show a marked and selective deficiency in cells in peripheral lymphoid organs This depletion was not observed in thymus where the distribution of and cells is normal Moreover the emigration of T cells from thymus is normal indicating that the depletion occurs in the periphery mice should be useful as models to dissect the role of cytotoxic cells in immune responses and as recipients of normal and neoplastic hematopoietic cells The selective depletion of cells in one founder strain could have implications for postthymic development View details for Web of Science ID A1995TB46700053

ascidian Botryllus schlosseri is a model organism for research on invertebrate histocompatibility development and evolutionary biology Nonetheless the basic life history of Pacific Ocean populations of the species remains unknown We determined field rates of growth reproduction and senescence in four cohorts of schlosseri colonies in Monterey Bay California Colonies grew exponentially as juveniles and reached sizes of up to 1400 zooids within 69 days After a juvenile phase lasting at least 49 days the colonies began to reproduce sexually Each zooid produced up to 10 clutches each with a maximum of 5 eggs resulting in very high fecundity of up to 8000 eggs per colony Following a short period maximum 70 days of continuous sexual reproduction colonies abruptly senesced and died while still bearing a full clutch of eggs Senescence progressed through four distinct stages over weeks and inevitably led to the simultaneous death of all zooids in the colony Although senescence was the main cause of mortality some colonies died as a result of predation or undermined causes Certain life history traits varied significantly between cohorts that settled at different times of year For example lifespans in the field varied from about 3 months for spring to 8 months for colonies but the lifetime fecundity of colonies did not vary between cohorts The morphologies and life histories of

however the functional reconstituting activity of this fraction is heterogeneous Only around 25 of clonal reconstitutions by cells from this population are long term remaining clones yield transient multilineage reconstitutions By fractionating based on lineage marker expression the population has been resolved into three subpopulations and Of these only the population is highly enriched for reconstituting hematopoietic stem cells A comparison of transient and multipotent progenitors indicates that progenitors have less activity are equally radioprotective and are less frequently in cell

give rise to greatly expanded numbers of myeloid and lymphoid cells while and cells were reported to be highly proliferative myeloid and progenitors respectively Both cell types appear to be much less frequent than previously reported and we observed no activity consistent with their characterization as committed progenitors of expanded numbers of cells The original identification of these populations may have resulted from a failure to distinguish bonafide signals from autofluorescent background and nonspecific staining The progenitor activities originally associated with these

marrow but in these experiments they do not give rise to detectable levels of progeny on injection into lethally irradiated mice cells appear to be cells without significant proliferation potential in

understanding the role of HSCs versus other hematopoietic cells in the quantitative reconstitution of various blood cell types has awaited methods to isolate HSCs A candidate population of mouse HSCs cells was isolated several years ago and recently this population has been shown to be the only population of BM cells that contains HSCs in mice As few as 100 of these cells can radioprotect 95 to 100 of irradiated mice resulting multilineage reconstitution In this study we examined the reconstitution potential of irradiated mice transplanted with purified BM cells peripheral blood PB white blood cells were detected as early as day 9 or 10 when 100 to cells were used with minor differences The reappearance of platelets by day 14 and thereafter was also seen at all HSC doses 100 to cells with a slight All studied HSC doses also allowed RBC levels to recover although at the 100 cell dose a delay in hematocrit recovery was observed at day 14 When irradiated mice were transplanted with 500 cells compared with 1 x 10 6 BM cells the equivalent amount of cells that contain 500 cells as well as progenitor and mature cells very little difference in the kinetics of recovery of PB white blood cells platelets and hematocrit was observed Surprisingly even when 200 cells were mixed with 4 x 10 5 BM cells in a competitive repopulation assay most of the early days 11 and 14 PB myeloid cells were derived from the HSC genotype indicating the superiority of the cells over cells even in the early phases of myeloid reconstitution Within the population the Rhodamine 123 Rh123 hi subset dominates in PB myeloid reconstitution at 10 to 14 days only to be overtaken by the Rh123lo subset at 3 weeks and thereafter These findings indicate that HSCs can account for the early phase of

Within the kidney cyp C is highly expressed in a narrow zone in the outer medulla Using monoclonal antibodies reactive against cyp C we find that the kidney cells expressing cyp C correspond to the S3 segment of the nephron The S3 segment has been shown to sustain histopathological damage from high dosages of CsA raising the possibility that cyp C may be involved in mediating this damage View

of mice infected by the radiation leukemia virus RadLV By the combined use of antibodies against the envelope glycoprotein gp70 of RadLV the cell surface marker 1C11 and the receptor TCR complex we found that in the thymus the earliest expression of viral gp70 is in 1C11hi cells a small but significant percentage of these cells also express CD3 A first wave of viral replication manifested by the expression of high levels of gp70 in thymocytes over 70 positive reaches a peak at 2 weeks during this period no significant changes are observed in the expression of 1C11 or CD3 The population of cells is drastically reduced at 3 to 4 weeks after infection However a second cohort of cells appears after 4 weeks and these cells express high levels of 1C11 and TCR determinants as well lymphomas differ from normal thymocytes in their CD4 CD8 phenotype with domination by one or more subsets Characterization of TCR gene rearrangements in lymphomas shows that most of these tumors are clonal or

stimulator of hemopoietic progenitor cells In the context of transplantation of hemopoietic cells to irradiated allogeneic hosts natural killer NK cells exert restrictive control on hemopoietic cell proliferation and are regularly found in elevated concentration in areas of intense hemopoiesis The present study was designed to examine the effects with time of S1F in vivo on the numbers of NK cells identified by the presence of the NK surface molecule in the spleen and bone marrow Throughout the first 3 days of S1F exposure NK cell numbers in spite of rapid 1 day and significant increases in the other hemopoietic cell lineages did not change in either the spleen or the bone marrow However NK cells were increased in both organs by 7 days of S1F exposure At this time immature granuloid and erythroid cells and the large lymphoid cells in the spleen had more than doubled their respective control numbers and in the bone marrow immature granuloid cells increased by 47 of control levels The presence of a late but not early influence of S1F on NK cells of the spleen and bone marrow suggests an indirect effect of S1F on this lineage occurring only when hemopoiesis becomes sufficiently

characterized by their ability to differentiate into all hematopoietic cell lineages while retaining their capacity for self renewal One of the predictions of this model is the existence of a heterogeneous pool of HSCs some members of which are destined to become lineage restricted progenitor cells while others function to renew the stem cell pool To test whether HSCs are heterogeneous with respect to cell cycle status we determined the fraction of phenotypically defined murine HSCs that contain 2n amount of DNA as measured by propidium iodide staining Hoechst dye uptake and 3H thymidine labeling that fraction is In contrast in the developing fetal liver 40 of HSCs are in the phases of the cell cycle Those HSCs which exhibit a low level of staining with rhodamine 123 are almost exclusively in 97 whereas only 70 of HSCs which stain brightly for rhodamine 123 are in The injection of 100 HSCs rescued 90 of lethally irradiated mice in contrast to 100 HSCs which protected only 25 of lethally irradiated recipients Enhanced multilineage reconstitution of the peripheral blood was observed in recipients of 100 HSCs compared to recipients of 100 cells These data indicate

bone marrow The mouse has been further used in combination with a mouse bone marrow stromal cell line that supports human myeloid and B lymphoid differentiation in vitro to identify a minor subset of fetal cells that exhibit multilineage hematopoietic potentialities View details for Web of Science ID A1993MA47900023 View details for PubMedID 7689676 MEDIATES LYMPHOCYTE BINDING TO THE MUCOSAL

lymphocytes that is expressed by mucosal venules and helps direct lymphocyte traffic into Peyer patches PP and the intestinal lamina propria We demonstrate that the lymphocyte integrin alpha 4 beta 7 also implicated in homing to PP is a receptor for Certain antibodies to alpha 4 and beta 7 integrin chains but not to the beta 2 integrin inhibit lymphocyte binding to purified and to transfectants Lymph node lymphocytes alpha 4 beta TK1 lymphoma cells and a beta variant of an alpha B cell line 38C13 bind constitutively to Binding is enhanced by Mn integrin activation The related integrin alpha 4 beta 1 supports efficient binding to but not to even after integrin activation indicating that is a preferential ligand for alpha 4 beta 7 Alpha 4 beta 7 can also bind but this requires greater integrin activation than binding to The findings imply a selective role for the interaction of alpha 4 beta 7 and lymphocyte in homing to mucosal sites View details for PubMedID 7687523 CLONING AND CHARACTERIZATION OF CYCLOPHILIN PROTEIN A CANDIDATE NATURAL CELLULAR LIGAND FOR PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA Friedman Trahey Weissman I 1993 90 14 Abstract We report the protein purification and the cloning and characterization of a cDNA encoding the proteins that bind with high affinity to cyclophilin C in the absence of cyclosporin Transfection of this cDNA into COS cells directs the production of a glycoprotein of 77 kDa that binds to in the absence but not the presence of cyclosporin Homology comparisons reveal that this protein and gene termed CyCAP for protein possess a domain scavenger receptor domain found in a variety of molecules the rest of the sequence is apparently specific This result raises the possibility

lymphomas that contain virus EBV DNA sequences We investigated the characteristics of posttransplant lymphomas that lacked expression of the usual markers associated with EBV transformation We describe four lymphomas seen recently at our institution Two of these four cases were one was and in one staining for CD4 and CD8 expression was not performed One lymphoma was a lymphoma from a kidney transplant recipient the second was an lymphoma from a heart transplant patient Two lymphomas were and had clonal receptor beta gene rearrangements The other two lymphomas expressed markers CD4 and CD43 and lacked expression of markers CD19 CD20 CD21 CD22 CD23 and surface Ig Both lymphomas were tumorigenic after their heterotransplantation into severe combined immunodeficient SCID mice Cytogenetics immunophenotyping and genotyping of the secondary tumors from SCID mice showed their clonality and identity with the patients primary tumors Novel lymphoma cell lines and were established from tumors that had been passaged in SCID mice An immunodeficient environment may facilitate the growth of these or biphenotypic lymphomas the etiology of their genesis can include transformation

OF A INTERMEDIATE JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MEDICINE Kraft Weissman Waller 1993 178 1 Abstract Human thymocyte differentiation was examined by injecting fetal thymic progenitor populations into human thymic xenografts in mice Thymic progenitors were fluorescently labeled with the lipophilic dye PKH2 The phenotypes of their progeny could be identified by flow cytometric analysis of cells with a very high fluorescent PKH2 signal Intrathymic injection of purified triple negative TN thymocytes resulted in the sequential appearance of and cells with the subsequent appearance of small numbers of phenotypically mature and cells over a period Sorted thymocytes injected intrathymically rapidly differentiated to cells fetal thymocytes in cell cycle differentiated into phenotypically mature and populations whereas nondividing cells failed to differentiate after intrathymic transfer The number of cell divisions that occurred between the injection of TN thymocytes and their progeny at different time points was estimated based on the decrease in the intensity of the PKH2 label The average length of the cell cycle for the TN population was calculated to be 24 The model thus provides a useful tool for studying the kinetics of cell division and differentiation of human thymocytes in vivo View details for Web of Science ID A1993LH54900024 View details for PubMedID 8315382 LYAR A NOVEL NUCLEOLAR PROTEIN WITH MOTIFS IS INVOLVED IN REGULATION GENES DEVELOPMENT Su HERSHBERGER Weissman 1993 7 5 Abstract A cDNA encoding a novel zinc finger protein has been isolated from a mouse leukemia line on the basis of its expression of a epitope in a lambda gt11 library The putative gene was mapped on mouse chromosome 1 closely linked to but not linked to the CD5 gene The cDNA is therefore named antibody reactive clone LYAR The putative polypeptide encoded by the cDNA consists of 388 amino acids with a zinc finger motif and three copies of nuclear localization signals Antibodies raised against a LYAR fusion protein reacted with a protein of 45 kD on Western blots and by immunoprecipitation Immunolocalization indicated that LYAR was present predominantly in the nucleoli The LYAR mRNA was not detected in brain thymus bone marrow liver heart and muscle Low levels of LYAR mRNA were detected in kidney and spleen However the LYAR gene was expressed at very high levels in immature spermatocytes in testis The LYAR mRNA is present at high levels in early embryos and preferentially in fetal liver and fetal thymus A number of and leukemic lines expressed LYAR at high levels although it was not detectable in bone marrow and thymus During leukemogenesis high levels of LYAR were expressed in preleukemic thymocytes and in acute T leukemia cells Fibroblast cells overexpressing the LYAR cDNA from a retrovirus vector though not phenotypically transformed in vitro had increased ability to form tumors in mice Therefore LYAR may function as a novel nucleolar

number and distribution of phenotypically defined hematopoietic stem cells in vivo mice were treated with continuous infusions of SIF for up to 7 days The bone marrow demonstrated a transient increase in the number of cells with no change in cellularity The radioprotective capacity of bone marrow cells was significantly reduced and a 30 decrease in Thylo stem cells cells was observed In marked contrast in the spleen a increase in cellularity was accompanied by a increase in cells spleen cells provided increased radioprotection and a corresponding increase in the number of cells In the peripheral blood an increase in both neutrophils and lymphocytes resulted however the number of cells remained 1 SIF produced a increase in radioprotection capacity and a increase in the number of cells in the peripheral blood The increased radioprotection capacity of both the spleen cells and peripheral blood cells was associated with multilineage reconstitution of recipient mice The total number of cells isolated per mouse after SIF treatment was not significantly increased These results show that exogenous SIF treatment causes a redistribution of cells and stem cell activity while having little effect on the total number of stem cells in the mouse View details for Web of Science ID A1993KX81600133 View details for PubMedID 7682717 HETEROGENEITY OF HEMATOPOIETIC CURRENT OPINION

concludes in a phase of selective cell and zooid death called takeover Every week all asexually derived parental zooids synchronously regress over a period and are replaced by a new generation Here we document the sequential ultrastructural changes which accompany cell death during zooid degeneration The principal mode of visceral cell death during takeover occurred by apoptosis the majority of cells condensing and fragmenting into multiple apoptotic bodies Cytoplasmic organelles mitochondria basal bodies striated rootlets within apoptotic bodies retained ultrastructural integrity Dying cells and fragments were then swiftly ingested by specialized blood macrophages or intraepithelial phagocytes and subsequently underwent secondary necrotic lysis Certain organs stomach intestine displayed a combination of necrotic and apoptotic changes Lastly the stomach which demonstrated some of the earliest regressive changes exhibited intense cytoplasmic immunostaining with a monoclonal antibody to ubiquitin at the onset of takeover rabbit antiserum against sodium dodecyl ubiquitin detected a characteristic band by Western blot analysis Collectively these findings raise the possibility that cell death during takeover is a dynamic process which requires active participation of cells in their own destruction View details for Web of Science ID A1993KT71600014 View details

cells in allografts autoimmune diabetes and a number of other inflammatory lesions In order to describe more completely the correlation between granzyme A expression and the presence of in vivo cytolytic effects we grafted allogeneic rat hearts with vascular anastomoses in a heterotopic location and treated the hosts with either cyclosporine monoclonal antibody MRC OX38 or no therapy The grafts were evaluated by palpation for cardiac functions by immunohistochemistry for expression by staining for inflammatory infiltration and by in situ hybridization for granzyme A expression The appearance of granzyme cells in untreated allografts preceded both functional and standard histopathological and immunohistochemical evidence of graft rejection by two days In combinations where cyclosporine and treatments allowed indefinite allograft survival the allografts showed minimal numbers of granzyme cells whether cellular infiltrates developed or not The number of granzyme cells present in the cardiac allografts in treated and untreated animals correlated with either current or impending episodes of rejection The early time course of granzyme A expression suggests that it can

DIFFERENT LEADER PEPTIDES JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY HERSHBERGER Gershenfeld Weissman Su 1992 267 35 Abstract Granzyme A is a serine protease that together with the other granular components of cytotoxic T lymphocyte CTL cells has been implicated in the cytolysis process We report here two different messages and the genomic organization of the mouse granzyme A gene The granzyme A gene is composed of six exons spanning 7 kilobases Alternative splicing of the second exon results in the two transcripts The two mRNA species encode the same mature granzyme A protein but with different leader sequences The first HF1 encodes a typical leader signal sequence similar to other granzymes but the second HF2 putative leader sequence is different and less hydrophobic Both messages are present in cultured CTL cell lines and in normal lymphoid tissues They are both induced when CTL cells are activated in vitro or in vivo Both messages can be translated in vitro although the HF1 message appears to be much more efficient as a template The putative 5 promoter region of the HF gene sequenced 500 base pairs of upstream sequences contains no well defined promoter sequences aside from the TATA box The results suggest that a granzyme A may be produced with putative different leader sequences from two different mRNAs b this may provide a model system for studying alternate splicing and the evolution of a complex enzymatic system in an organelle and c the genomic DNA reported will be useful for studying transcription regulations involved in controlling the specific

proteases known as granzymes in their lytic granules Despite considerable effort convincing evidence that these enzymes play an obligatory role in the lytic process has not been presented To investigate the function of one of these proteases granzyme A GA we utilized an antisense expression vector to lower the level of the enzyme in the cells An expression vector containing antisense cDNA for GA and the gene for hygromycin B resistance was constructed and electroporated into the murine CTL line AR1 Transfectants were selected based on resistance to hygromycin B and a number of stable lines were developed One of the antisense lines had greatly reduced levels of GA mRNA when compared to the parental cells or to control lines transfected with the vector lacking the antisense DNA The message levels for two other CTL granule proteins granzyme B and perforin were unaffected by the antisense vector The amount of GA as measured by enzymatic activity was to lower in the transfectant Most significantly this line also consistently showed 50 to 70 lower ability to lyse nucleated target cells and to degrade their DNA Furthermore it exhibited 90 to 95 lower lytic activity to SRBC Conjugate formation with target cells however was normal These data provide strong evidence that GA plays an important role in the cytolytic cycle and that the quantity of enzyme is a limiting factor

staphylococcal enterotoxins SE and determined their effects on the development and responsiveness of human populations defined by their expression of CD4 and CD8 and the type of V beta molecule in their receptors After single intraperitoneal injections of SEB or SEE we observed specific effects on thymic T cells expressing a cognate V beta receptor TCR V beta in the case of mice and V beta in the case of mice using both immunohistochemical staining of thymic frozen sections and flow cytometric analyses An injection of SEB resulted in a 32 decrease in the total percentages of V beta cells in thymic sections after 2 days with the greatest effect seen in the medulla without a demonstrable effect on V beta or V beta cells cell sorter analysis demonstrated that TCRhi thymocytes expressing a cognate V beta TCR declined transiently by 35 to 45 1 to 2 days after the injection of SE Analysis of thymic subpopulations showed decreases in the TCRhi and cells and an increase in TCRlo cells Multiple injections of SE resulted in 50 to 60 decreases in cognate V beta populations Thymocytes prepared from mice demonstrated specific anergy to the SE to which they had previously been exposed in vivo but had a normal proliferative response to other superantigens in an in vitro assay In contrast to the effects on thymic T cells single injections of SE resulted in a twofold increase in the total numbers of circulating and human T cells and a fourfold to eightfold increase in T cells expressing a cognate V beta TCR Using SE as superantigens in mice we have been able to induce clonal

noncovalently associated with integrin beta Here we describe the cloning and expression of a mouse cDNA encoding beta p which is an acid transmembrane glycoprotein The genomic Southern blot analysis

alpha 4 and beta 7 Moreover an 7 monoclonal antibody specifically blocked binding of normal lymphocytes to Peyer patch HEV but did not inhibit their binding to peripheral lymph node HEVs indicating

cells of the thymic graft C57BL type and lack murine leukemia virus expression Both SCID and lymphomas are phenotypically but only the tumors express CD3 Injection of C57BL or bone marrow into

the colonial tunicate Botryllus schlosseri Colony specificity in these organisms is controlled by the locus Rejection occurs only between colonies that do not share any allelic determinant at this locus Two sets of experiments were conducted 1 pairs of nonfusible oozooids were interacted naturally along a period of several months They rejected disconnected and in 20 of the cases interacted again 2 Repeated colony allorecognition assays were done on 15 pairs of interacting subclones up to 5 consecutive Major results indicate 1 Not all interactions resulted in necrotic areas points of rejection PORs 2 A full repertoire of PORs was attained within the first 10 days Thereafter no more PORs were added 3 The outcome of indifference cases where contacts did not result in rejection was repeatedly recorded in multiple tests and its frequency increased in the secondary and tertiary tests along a set of 5 consecutive tests It is concluded that allospecific memory as measured by an accelerated production of PORs and amplification in their number was not characteristic of the Botryllus rejection phenomenon which however reveals the qualities of a low responder These results are

in the wild or in the laboratory with other members of the same species if both individuals share at least one allele at a single highly polymorphic locus termed the locus Laboratory studies revealed that after the establishment of a common blood circulatory system between a fusible pair one of the colonies in the chimera is usually resorbed a phenomenon that occurs after an interval of 1 week or extends to up to 8 months In the present article we review this allogeneic resorption in Botryllus schlosseri a cosmopolitan protochordate The studies on allogeneic resorption in schlosseri revealed 13 typical characteristics However several processes interrupt successful resorption such as the retreat growth phenomenon chimeric death and others It was also found that allogeneic resorption is not only genetically controlled but is also controlled by a polymorphic hierarchial phenomenon including the locus and additional unrelated loci One basic rule for this genetic system is that colonies heterozygotic on the resorption elements will resorb more homozygotic partners This colony resorption expressed by a morphological elimination of one partner is probably manifested by cellular elements circulating in the tunicate blood system However it was also shown that some cells of the inferior partner such as the stem cells may escape resorption a phenomenon that raises the threat of cell parasitism View details for Web of Science ID A1992JB85500002 View details for PubMedID 1505688 A CYCLICAL DEATH PHENOMENON IN A COLONIAL UROCHORDATE DEVELOPMENTAL DYNAMICS Lauzon Ishizuka Weissman 1992 194 1 Abstract Botryllus schlosseri is a colonial ascidian whose asexually derived clonally modular systems of zooids exhibit developmental synchrony The blastogenic cycle culminates in a phase of programmed cell and zooid death called takeover in which all functional zooids die over a 30 hr period and are replaced by a new generation of individuals Because of the weekly recurrence and magnitude of visceral death in this model organism we have begun to characterize the mechanisms that govern takeover Here we describe a monoclonal antibody that recognizes a novel 57 Kd polypeptide under reducing conditions localized to the perivisceral extracellular matrix PVEM of buds and zooids as well as blood cells of Botryllus by immunofluorescence and immunogold labeling of tissue sections During their active feeding phase zooids exhibited a uniform labeling pattern of PVEM along their anteroposterior axis At the onset of takeover T 3 hr immunostaining became diffuse or absent at the anterior end which paralleled the axis of contraction of the dying zooid whereas the posterior end retained its labeling integrity During mid T 15 hr to late T 28 hr takeover issue damage was extensive large blood macrophages and other immunoreactive blood cells invaded the peribranchial cavity whereas PVEM labeling gradually disappeared along the entire axis These findings indicate that takeover is a dynamic process in which extracellular matrix breakdown proceeds in a polarized fashion beginning at the anterior end of each zooid and gradually propagating toward the posterior end View details for Web of Science ID A1992JN15200008 View details for PubMedID 1421521 MOUSE MRP8 AND MRP14 2 INTRACELLULAR PROTEINS ASSOCIATED WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE MYELOID LINEAGE

cystic fibrosis antigen or p8 and p14 We report here the cloning of mouse MRP8 and MRP14 and their pattern of expression during hematopoiesis Mouse MRP8 and MRP14 proteins share 59 identity with their human counterparts but they are more divergent than the other members of the S100 protein family Mouse MRP proteins are coexpressed in fetal myeloid progenitors where they are detected as early as day 11 of gestation In fetal liver and yolk sac cell populations increased in number in association with the development of the myeloid lineage In adult mouse we identified MRP8 and MRP14 proteins in immature myeloid cells of the bone marrow myeloid cells in the splenic red pulp and marginal zone in addition to monocytes and blood neutrophils However MRP expression is lost as cells terminally differentiate into tissue macrophages In addition using peritoneal inflammatory exudates we showed that MRP8 and MRP14 proteins are highly expressed in recruited neutrophils and monocytes View details

nonexclusive viewpoints The first stipulates that random changes of cellular and molecular structures lead to death following progressive wear and tear The second argues that life span is at least in part genetically programmed and therefore aging may also result from intrinsic processes Here we demonstrate that ramets clonal replicates experimentally separated from colonies of the acidian protochordate Botryllus schlosseri died months after their separation almost simultaneously with their parent colony and sibling ramets In addition in experimentally joined chimeras between ramets of senescent and nonsenescent colonies elements from different parent colonies displayed timing of mortality Thus the senescent phenotype was simultaneously expressed both in chimeras and in unfused ramets of the parent colony that was undergoing senescence whereas control ramets from the other partner survived These findings provide experimental evidence for a heritable basis underlying mortality in protochordates unlinked to reproductive effort and other life history traits of this species View details for Web of Science ID A1992HP04300080 View details for PubMedID 1565651 ISOLATION

cells Monoclonal antibodies against the extracellular portion of the mouse Kit receptor were established Five percent to 10 of total bone marrow cells expressed the Kit receptor and half of them lack the expression of lineage markers The Kit receptor was expressed on of cells which express antigen at a low level and constitute approximately of adult bone marrow and fetal liver by previous studies these cells have been shown to be highly enriched for multipotent hematopoietic stem cells HSCs and are the only hematopoietic cell subset with this activity Spleen colony formation and multilineage reconstitution activities were contained in the but not in the subpopulations of cells from adult bone marrow suggesting that the Kit receptor is expressed on HSCs from the earliest pluripotent HSCs The role of steel factor in the development and of HSCs was tested with homozygote fetuses which lack genes to encode functional steel factor They were shown to have of the number of HSCs on days when compared with normal litermates However the absolute number of HSCs increased during fetal development in the mice The results suggest that the Kit factor interaction may not be essential for the

were examined for the expression of granzyme A and perforin Previous studies have demonstrated that the expression of these proteins which are implicated as mediators of cytotoxicity can be used to identify putative cytolytic lymphocytes in vivo synovial fluid samples were analyzed by in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry In six patients receiving low doses of immunosuppressant a population of granzyme and lymphocytes could be identified In contrast lymphocytes from patients who were receiving high doses of immunosuppressant did not contain any granzyme or lymphocytes Synovial fluid lymphocytes from patients with osteoarthritis did not express either marker The expression of these markers demonstrates the presence of potentially functional cytolytic lymphocytes expressing proteins required to mediate killing in the synovial fluid of patients with rheumatoid arthritis This suggests that cytolytic lymphocytes may be involved in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis

enriched pluripotent and multipotent hematopoietic stem cells HSCs are isolated from bone marrow and fetal liver as cells Pluripotent HSCs express receptor on their surface but the generation and proliferation of early fetal HSCs take place in the absence of steel factor T precursor cells migrate into the fetal thymus by chemotactic mechanism CD4lo precursors represent a newly defined phase of development in the thymus between the bone stem cells and the intrathymic precursors Only fetal but not adult HSCs have the capacity to differentiate into V gamma and V gamma T cells under the fetal thymic microenvironment and HSC themselves may lose some of their developmental potential during ontogeny It is postulated that HSCs are the locus of a complicated but precise developmental clock that may determine both the closure of some gene loci V gamma 3 and V gamma 4 T cell receptor and embryonic and fetal globin and the activation of others the N nucleotide insertion machinery View details

lineages permanently We initially demonstrated that HSCs were contained in a rare approximately subset of bone marrow cells with the following surface marker profile These cells were capable of reconstitution and radioprotection of lethally irradiated mice with an enrichment that mirrors their representation in bone marrow namely However the experiments reported did not exclude the possibility that stem cell activity may also reside in populations that are or In this article stem cell activity was determined by measuring a radioprotection provided by sorted cells b

their extracorporeal blood vessel termini the ampullae they either reject each other or fuse This phenomenon is controlled by a single gene locus with multiple codominantly expressed alleles Rejecting colonies share no alleles Here we analyze allogeneic responses of Monterey Mon California versus Woods Hole WH Massachusetts colonies Of 42 Mon x WH pairs tested allogeneic rejection reactions occurred in all Necrotic lesions points of rejection PORs were produced and developed only by Woods Hole ampullae either within the Woods Hole tunic in the borderline between the paired colonies or within the Monterey tunic Four types of PORs were characterized All types involved reactions of blood cells and vessels including infiltration hemorrhage formation retraction and ampullae amputation These findings were observed in single WH x Mon pairs in multiple subclones of WH x Mon from two parental colonies seven independent colony pairs were assayed and on multiple repeats of interactions

Majumdar Schick Lieberman Weissman 1991 78 10 Abstract We reasoned that the mouse could provide an appropriate lymphoid or stromal microenvironment to support the growth of primary human lymphoma Heterotransplantation of nine cases of primary lymphoma NHL into untreated SCID mice and SCID mice reconstituted with human fetal thymus spleen and liver resulted in the development of lymphoid tumors in five 56 cases Two clonal NHL grew after a mean of 90 days after injection of primary lymphoma cell suspensions into the thymus xenografts in mice and failed to grow in a variety of sites in SCID mice except for small tumors that developed after a long latency period after intracranial injection of tumor cell suspensions into weanling SCID mice Successful serial transplantation of NHL in SCID and mice required the presence of a human lymphoid or tumor microenvironment and was enhanced by pretreating the SCID mice with 175 rad radiation and antiasialo antisera Analysis of the primary and transplanted tumors showed identical patterns of surface markers by flow cytometry and immunophenotyping of fixed tissue sections and in one case reactivity with a specific monoclonal antibody to V beta Genotyping of the transplanted tumors showed receptor gene rearrangements identical to those present in the primary tumors In one case the presence of B cells in association with the primary tumor resulted in the growth of a lymphoblastoid neoplasm in addition to the malignant lymphoma after transplantation of tumor fragments to SCID mice The data support the hypothesis that a human lymphoid microenvironment enhances the growth of NHL in SCID mice The thymus graft provides an apparently unique microenvironment that supports the growth of primary NHL and can be used to study the

alpha chain of the murine patch adhesion molecule LPAM which is associated with lymphocyte homing have been isolated by screening with the human alpha 4h probe Several alpha 4 antigenic determinants were identified on cells after transfection From overlapping clones approximately 5 kb of contiguous nucleotide sequence have been determined encoding a protein sequence of 1039 amino acids for the LPAM alpha chain alpha 4m LPAM is a member of the integrin family of heterodimers and alpha 4m is the murine homologue of the human alpha 4 h chain The two proteins have a total sequence similarity of 84 with an almost perfect conservation amino acids in the cytoplasmic domain Like alpha 4h alpha 4m is distinct from other integrin alpha chains because it has neither an nor a cleavage site The positions of the characteristic Cysteine residues are conserved and a putative protease cleavage site is located near the middle of the protein sequence The part of the protein contains seven homologous repeats and three of them include putative divalent sites These sites are among the most conserved between the alpha 4m sequence and other alpha chains and may therefore be involved in the binding of integrin alpha and beta chains An additional cDNA clone was isolated which shares a sequence of perfect homology with the alpha 4m encoding cDNAs but has a unique 3 end This observation correlates with the fact that three discrete murine RNA bands are observed in Northern blot experiments using alpha 4m as a probe whereas only two human RNA species are described for alpha 4h

and primitive myeloerythroid progenitor cells Thylo referred to as defined by their in vivo repopulating properties have been purified from mouse bone marrow In this study the growth factor requirements of these two subsets were compared in assays progenitor cells grew well in interleukin IL 3 alone and showed maximum growth when two factors plus or plus were combined In contrast stem cells were generally not responsive to any single factor tested Some colony formation was found when was paired with either or and this was significantly enhanced as additional factors were included A remarkable frequency of as much as 1 colony per input cells was achieved when and factors were used together These differences in factor requirements presumably reflect the need for multiple factor signaling in the more primitive stem cell population In most other aspects of colony formation and cells were very similar They generated colonies that had equivalent distributions in size and cellular composition One notable difference was found in the kinetics of their response Whereas nearly all cells formed colonies within 7 days a significant fraction of cells delayed colony formation

thymocytes were analyzed for their T cell receptor expression by the polymerase chain reaction PCR Both day 14 fetal liver and adult bone marrow cells gave rise to thymocytes with V gamma gamma 1 transcripts However the average size of the PCR products derived from adult precursors was slightly larger than that from fetal precursors DNA sequence analysis of the V gamma gamma 1 transcripts showed that early fetal liver precursors predominantly gave rise to thymocytes with the V gamma gamma 1 transcripts without N nucleotide insertion while late fetal liver and adult marrow precursors predominantly gave rise to thymocytes with modified V gamma gamma 1 junctions These results suggest the possibility that the level of the N nucleotide insertion is programmed at the level of thymic precursors This study also supported the model presented previously that the developmental potential of hematopoietic stem cells may change during ontogeny View details for Web of Science ID

hematopoietic progenitors in bone marrow by their unique ability to undergo multilineage differentiation and Two mouse mutations dominant spotting W and steel Sl have pleiotropic effects on hematopoiesis gametogenesis and melanoblast development These two mutations have been shown to be intrinsic W and microenvironmental Sl defects Recently molecular studies revealed that the W and Sl loci encode the receptor and steel factor SLF respectively The receptor is expressed on HSCs and hematopoietic progenitors while SLF is produced by stromal cells SLF acts on hematopoietic progenitors synergistically with other growth factors Here we review the effect of these mutations on mouse hematopoiesis and show that SLF acts on HSCs and other myeloerythroid progenitors but that it in our hands does not play a critical role in HSC generation or Rather SLF is the most potent with or found that acts on these cells but the effect of such treatments is the rather specific and massive

characterization of a new binding protein for the immunosuppressive drug cyclosporin A CsA This new cyclophilin cyclophilin C cyp C shows extensive homology with all previously identified cyclophilins Cyp C mRNA is expressed in a restricted subset of tissues relative to cyclophilins A and B but is present in those tissues reported to be most affected by CsA therapy A cyp C fusion protein has isomerase activity and CsA inhibits this activity Using the cyp C fusion protein as an affinity ligand to probe cellular extracts we find that the cyp C fusion protein binds specifically to a 77 kd protein in the absence of CsA while in the presence of CsA it instead binds specifically to a 55 kd protein We propose that the p77 is involved in cyp C native function and that the p55 is involved in

marrow BM were tested at limiting dilution for their ability to reconstitute Dexter monolayers Several classes of BM cells can reconstitute Dexter cultures first forming discrete cobblestone areas which then mature into colonies consisting primarily of maturing myeloid and erythroid cells Most such colonies have a limited lifespan in culture Only the cell fraction gives rise to colonies that survive longer than 3 weeks which suggests that a analysis for reconstitution of Dexter cultures can serve as a quantitative measure of stem cell activity Additional experiments were performed to assess the formation of new progenitor cells in reconstituted Dexter cultures Again only cultures seeded with the stem fraction contained expanded numbers of replatable CM responsive cells Quantitative analysis indicates that 97 of the replatable of whole BM is contributed by the cell fraction again suggesting a potential stem assay Such quantitative in vitro assays might prove useful

could be demonstrated by a clonogenic tumor assay staining of frozen sections with a monoclonal antibody mAb against a human B cell antigen CD19 and with the polymerase chain reaction technique A protocol using cytotoxic effector cells was developed and used to selectively deplete the tumor cells from bone marrow These cells were developed by growing peripheral blood mononuclear cells in the presence of interferon gamma mAb and interleukin 2 The timing of treatment was critical and optimal if was added before treatment The cells that were stimulated by followed by could be expanded by treatment with a mAb directed against CD3 These cells could be further activated by but not by tumor necrosis factor alpha With this protocol a tumor cell kill of 3 logs was obtained as measured by a clonogenic assay Interestingly despite their high cytotoxic activity against lymphoma cells these cells had little toxicity against a subset of normal human hematopoietic precursor cells units These cells were further tested by treating murine bone marrow contaminated with the human lymphoma cell line and injecting these cells into SCID mice to assay for tumor growth in vivo The animals injected with bone marrow contaminated with cells had enhanced survival if the bone marrow was treated with the killer cells before infusion The SCID mouse provides a useful in vivo model for evaluation of new

variety of assays When cells of this phenotype are injected into an irradiated animal they can permanently repopulate the entire hematopoietic system In the present study and experiments were used to address the question of how individual stem cells contribute to repopulation of the hematopoietic system following irradiation We calculated that 1 of 13 cells formed a clone comprising greater than 1 of peripheral white blood cells weeks after injection The majority of these clones included both lymphoid and myeloid lineages Approximately of the clones continued to produce new blood cells for 9 weeks or more but the remainder disappeared earlier including many that were multilineage Thus while the majority of bone marrow cells whose progeny are detected in the in vivo repopulation assay are pluripotential only a subset undergo in vivo Repopulation appears to be oligoclonal when limiting numbers of cells are injected However the number of clones contributing to hematopoiesis increases in

that are infiltrating the donor heart after transplantation A total of 29 different biopsies from 17 different patients who had undergone cardiac transplantation were examined Twelve biopsies classified by conventional histological criteria as showing evidence of rejection were found to contain lymphocytes expressing granzyme A and perforin Seven biopsies classified as showing no histological evidence of rejection infiltrating lymphocytes were found not to be expressing granzyme A or perforin However in 10 other biopsies from 5 different patients that had been classified as showing no evidence of rejection by the conventional grading system lymphocytes expressing granzyme A and perforin were detected In six of these cases the patient was found to have undergone a subsequent rejection episode In the other four cases the biopsies were either taken at a very early stage after transplantation and the high doses of immunosuppression used routinely at that stage are likely to have averted any rejection episodes or it was not possible to follow subsequent rejection episodes These results which are statistically significant p demonstrate that granzyme and lymphocytes can be identified in rejecting biopsies before histological damage is seen The identification of perforin and granzyme A expression in vivo suggest a possible role for these proteins in the cytolysis that occurs during transplantation rejection Furthermore the data presented here suggest that it may be possible to use granzyme A and perforin as early predictive markers of

formation between lymphocytes and stromal cells was investigated We found that lymphoid lines of both T and B lineages could form cell complexes with stromal cells from the thymus as well as bone marrow but not with macrophages or typical fibroblast lines Formation of these cell complexes is temperature dependent and requires the presence of active cellular metabolism and microfilament assembly of cytoskeleton We raised an antiserum against a thymic stromal cell clone in rats and found that after absorption this serum could effectively block cell complex formation between lymphocytes and stromal cells from both thymus and bone marrow An efficient blocking was obtained only when the antiserum was added at the initial stage of cell interaction From the blocking experiments and the analysis of immunoprecipitated materials from the stromal cell surface we identified a unique glycoprotein on the stromal cells as a molecule for mediating stromal interaction This is further supported by the findings that an antiserum raised in hamsters against the excised gel band corresponding to 107 kD which specifically immunoprecipitated the molecule effectively blocked

processing of the oligosaccharides into complex oligosaccharides the precursor matures in a single step into the form Experiments using deglycosylating enzymes and inhibitors of glycosylation demonstrate that the molecular mass of deglycosylated is 45 kDa extensive glycosylation is responsible for the difference in molecular mass with the mature form The core protein molecular weight of in vitro transcribed and translated cDNA is consistent with the estimated molecular mass of 37 kDa calculated from the cDNA sequence of the core protein and 8 to 10 kDa less than the protein molecular mass of translated in vivo in the presence of tunicamycin 45 kDa Inasmuch as we have ruled out glycosylation as accounting for this discrepancy this is consistent with the addition of one ubiquitin

1990 20 8 Abstract It has been previously shown that chimeras may be established between different colonies of the compound tunicate Botryllus schlosseri given that they share one allele in common on the fusibility locus However one of the partners in each chimera is often resorbed Here we tested for the existence of a memory component to this response as measured by the accelerated interval to resorption of a second set of semiallogeneic colonies Eight genetically unrelated colonies gave rise to eighteen chimeras After a complete resorption of the inferior partners in these chimeras secondary and tertiary sets of chimeras were established with some of them by fusion of the superior with naive subclones of the inferior partners It is shown here that a when multiple chimeras are prepared using the same pair of colonies subclones of only one of the partners are resorbed b high variation in the time for resorption is recorded when several chimeras are prepared from any specific pair of colonies and c the time for resorption is not related to the number of vessels connecting between the partners in the chimera nor to their relative body sizes Allospecific memory is not

functionally related group of genes lymph node homing receptor LHR granule membrane protein 140 and endothelial leukocyte adhesion molecule 1 are shown to constitute a gene cluster on mouse and human chromosome 1 In situ hybridization mapped to human chromosome 1 bands consistent with chromosomal localization of LHR Gene linkage analysis in the mouse indicated that these genes and serum coagulation factor V FV all map to a region of distal mouse chromosome 1 that is syntenic with human chromosome 1 with no crossovers identified between these four genes in 428 meiotic events Moreover long range restriction site mapping demonstrated that these genes map to within 300 kb in both the human and mouse genomes These data suggest that LHR and comprise an adhesion protein family the selectins that arose by multiple gene duplication events before divergence of mouse and human Furthermore the location of these genes on mouse and human chromosome 1 is consistent with a close evolutionary relationship to the complement genes which also are positioned on the same chromosomes in both species and with which these genes share a region of sequence homology These data

Weissman Saito Rinkevich B 1990 113 Abstract Colonial tunicates are complex marine invertebrates in fact protochordates that undergo a variety of histocompatibility reactions in their intraspecific competition for feeding surfaces By means of these reactions colonies fuse with kin extend domination over a feeding surface while isolating unrelated conspecifics The primary determinant of fusion with kin or rejection of is a single highly polymorphic histocompatibility gene locus or haplotype called Following fusion with nonidentical kin sharing 1 or more allele s the fused pair expands both chimeric partners via an asexual budding process further extending domination over a feeding surface However at some later time point an intense set of histoincompatibility reactions occurs between fused kin resulting in the destruction of all individuals of one of the genotypes ending the chimeric state In this review we describe what is known of the genetics and several biological properties encoded by the and the several independent gene loci that control the colony resorption phenomena that return the colony to the province of a single genotypic individual View details for Web of

generation of zooids takes over the colony When colonies come into direct contact they either reject each other or fuse Fusion is usually followed by the resorption of one of the partners in the chimera immunological resorption The striking morphological similarities between the two resorption phenomena suggest that both may involve tissue destruction following recognition events Here we attempt to modify these two events by whole colony gamma irradiation assays Three sets of experiments were performed 1 different doses of whole colony irradiation for determination of irradiation

and rads were n 24 n 15 and n 22 respectively Younger colonies months old may survive radiation better than older ones more than 13 months Many morphological alterations were recorded in irradiated colonies ampullar contraction dilation accumulation of pigment cells within ampullae abnormal bleeding from blood vessels sluggish blood circulation necrotic zones reduction in bud number and irregularities in zooid and system structures With doses of rads and above irradiation arrested the formation of new buds and interrupted normal takeover turning the colony into a chaotic bulk of

not reconstituted by sharing blood circulation with a syngeneic part Under rads some of the irradiated zooids within this type of union started to regenerate and at rads no resorption was recorded

tumors The 1C11 Ag is expressed on a subpopulation of normal thymocytes that is enriched in immature cells After fractionated this percentage increases gradually during the preleukemic period hence mAb 1C11 appears to identify a cell surface molecule This conclusion is supported by experiments demonstrating that flow preleukemic thymocytes progress rapidly to full neoplasia following intrathymic injection whereas nonexpressing cells do not Most of fetal thymocytes are as strongly positive as thymic lymphomas for the 1C11 Ag whereas T cell lines express moderate levels Multiparameter flow microfluorimetry analysis shows that 1C11 is expressed predominantly on thymic blast cells of three phenotypically defined subsets and all of which contain thymic progenitors By immunohistochemical staining the Ag is also found in association with epithelial cells on a variety of normal nonlymphoid tissue but is not detectable on heart tissue The 1C11 antibody immunoprecipitates a heterodimeric protein of kDa and the antigenic determinant is located on the H chain of the molecule When analyzed by under nonreducing conditions the molecule exists as a protein Enzymatic digestion of the

different murine leukemia viruses MuLVs T cell lymphomas do have greater specificity for their cognate retroviruses since free homologous retrovirus can best block the interaction between cells and virus adhered to the wells of a microtiter plate interactions are more easily demonstrated by this assay probably because low avidity interactions are stabilized as a result of the mode of virus

human peripheral blood lymphocytes Human RNA blot analysis shows a tissue and distribution of transcript expression generally parallel to that seen in the mouse with expression confined to lymphoid tissues and some cell lines Genomic DNA analysis suggests a gene under conditions The complete nucleotide sequence predicts a mature protein of 334 amino acids identical in length to mLHRc The protein

factor EGF domain and two homologous repeat units preserving the motif of complement regulatory proteins CRP are present in the human protein hLHRc and maintain the same tandem arrangement The lectin and regions are the most homologous while the CRP domains are less conserved between species The two CRP units in hLHRc are distinct from those in mLHRc in that they are homologous to one another

population which expressed low levels of and coexpressed B220 a form of the leukocyte common antigen contained early and potent precursors for B lymphocytes upon in vivo transfer to irradiated hosts These cells comprising 1 to 2 of bone marrow cells were enriched for large cells in the mitotic cycle the population lacked significant pluripotent hematopoietic stem cell activity and progenitors Most strikingly cells represented a highly enriched population of bone marrow cells that could be targets of Abelson murine leukemia virus transformation We propose that bone marrow cells represent

steady state mRNA of both C11 and HF genes were also elevated The activation of lysis serine protease enzymes and C11 and HF mRNA all peaked around day 5 in culture and was dose dependent In order to

killer cells was not as high as the NK cells however the addition of PHA into the lytic assay resulted in enhanced lysis comparable to that of NK cells These results showed that lytic activity

measured the relative levels of transcripts for 15 of the 22 known V beta gene segments The level of transcripts for the highest and lowest expressed V beta gene segment differed by greater than in the thymus and an even larger difference was observed in the periphery The levels of expressions were unrelated to the order of the V beta genes on the chromosome For most of the V beta gene segments the relative transcript levels were the same in the thymus and periphery suggesting that thymic selection in general does not act solely upon the V beta gene segment One V beta gene segment in the BALB and B10 mice strains was an exception to this rule V beta expression in the periphery of BALB and B10 mice inversely correlated with the expression of the MHC class II molecule Five V beta gene segments had reduced transcript levels in the periphery of mice compared with their thymic levels or to the levels found in mice The peripheral level of V beta 3 transcripts vary with MHC and haplotypes The observation that certain V beta transcript levels are reduced in the periphery when compared with the thymus favors the hypothesis that self tolerance at the T cell level results in the elimination of T cells rather than paralysis by a block at some step Finally the wide variability of V beta gene segment expression in the thymus suggests mechanisms exist to import an early bias to the repertoire Whether this bias results from differential V beta segment rearrangement rates differential V beta expression rates or events occurring after expression on thymocyte cell surfaces is

expression revealed a increase in specific cells over that observed in unresponsive lepromatous patients Expression of huHF serine esterase a marker for T cytotoxic cells were fourfold increased in reversal reaction and tuberculoid lesions above that detected in unresponsive lepromatous individuals Immunohistology of reversal reactions confirmed a selective increase of Th and T cytotoxic cells in the cellular immune response Of interest the microanatomic location of these serine esterase cells was identical to the distribution of cells Analysis of erythema nodosum leprosum ENL lesions revealed differences in the underlying immune processes in comparison with reversal reaction lesions Although phenotypic Th cells predominated in ENL lesions and serine esterase gene expression were

INTEGRIN MOLECULES INVOLVED IN LYMPHOCYTE HOMING TO PEYER PATCHES IMMUNOLOGICAL REVIEWS Holzmann Weissman 1989 108 Abstract This review summarizes experiments designed to analyze lymphocyte receptors mediating recognition of and adhesion to HEV in mucosal lymphoid organs A monoclonal antibody was selected which inhibits the adhesion of murine lymphocytes to Peyer patch HEV Antibody recognizes the alpha chain alpha 4m of the murine lymphocyte alpha beta heterodimer The association of alpha and beta chains requires the presence of ions Two proteins of Mr and which are also precipitated by antibody most likely represent fragments of alpha 4m The of a monospecific rabbit indicated that alpha 4m is analogous to the alpha chain of the human integrin molecule In addition a cDNA clone encoding the human alpha chain hybridized with RNA from alpha but not alpha cell lines However the beta subunit beta p was shown to be immunochemically and biochemically distinct from integrin beta 1 beta 2 and beta 3 indicating that beta p represents a unique integrin beta chain When the beta subunits associated with alpha 4m on a panel of lymphoma cell lines were analyzed it was found that depending on the cellular source alpha 4m can associate with either of two beta chains beta p or integrin beta 1 Therefore alpha 4m appears to be the common subunit of the two lymphocyte cell surface heterodimers alpha p and alpha 1 is analogous to the human molecule whereas represents a unique integrin heterodimer Antibody inhibited Peyer patch of normal mouse lymphocytes and every lymphoma cell line tested including and cell lines We also showed that the binding capacity of variants of a clonal lymphoma cell line to Peyer patch HEV correlates with the level of expression It therefore appears that both heterodimers are involved in patch HEV interactions and that the adhesion of lymphocytes to Peyer patch HEV is generally or We further investigated whether the human analog of can mediate adhesion of human lymphocytes to HEV in mucosal lymphoid organs ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS View details for Web of Science ID A1989U687100003 View details for PubMedID 2670742 MOUSE HOMING

receptor reveals a deduced protein with an unusual protein mosaic architecture containing a separate lectin domain an epidermal growth EGF domain and an extracellular precisely duplicated repeat unit which preserves the motif seen in the homologous repeat structure of complement regulatory proteins and other proteins The receptor molecule is potentially highly glycosylated and contains an apparent transmembrane region Analysis of messenger RNA transcripts reveals a predominantly lymphoid distribution in direct relation to the cell surface expression of the determinant and the cDNA clone is

Abstract The progenitor cells in the bone marrow that home to and repopulate the thymus have been incompletely characterized In particular it is not clear whether thymocytes differentiate directly from pluripotent hemopoietic stem cells that seed to the thymus or whether T stem cells prothymocytes arise in the bone marrow before the thymic migration In order to resolve this question we have used mAb specific for Ag to identify the bone marrow cells which can seed to and repopulate the thymus of irradiated mice We report here that the majority of cells in mouse bone marrow express low levels of the Ag plus high levels of a newly described Ag termed stem cell Ag Two distinct populations of cells in mouse bone marrow can be discriminated based on expression of any of a number of hemolymphoid Lin markers Thus and fractions of bone marrow contain cells A second Ag stem cell is expressed by cells but not by cells The fraction expresses intermediate levels of the phagocyte Ag and comprises 30 of the bone marrow cells which have previously been shown to be highly enriched in pluripotent hemopoietic stem cells By facilitating the isolation of highly purified subpopulations of bone marrow cells that can repopulate the thymus and should provide an experimental tool for describing the developmental potential of such bone marrow subsets View details for Web of Science ID

Dailey O 1988 141 12 Abstract The specific pattern of lymphocyte localization and recirculation is important for the induction and expression of normal immune responses In order to home to lymph nodes LN lymphocytes must first recognize and bind to specific high endothelial venules HEV in the LN Binding to LN HEV is mediated by specific lymphocyte receptors termed homing receptors which are recognized by the mAb We examined the changes that occur in homing receptor expression after activation of murine T lymphocytes in vitro Cells activated in MLC or by Con A undergo a 75 loss in their ability to recognize HEV as demonstrated by a decrease in binding to HEV in vitro Large activated cells isolated from a primary MLC by elutriator centrifugation were completely unable to recognize HEV whereas the small cells in the same culture continued to bind well Flow cytometric analysis with showed that the activated fraction had lost expression of the homing receptor Ag whereas the inactivated cells remained Concomitant with the loss of homing receptor expression most of the activated cells became strongly peanut agglutinin PNA demonstrating a marked change in surface glycosylation Thus these MLC consist of two major populations of T cells small inactivated lymphocytes that are and large activated blast cells that are Purified T cells activated by Con A gave rise to progeny showing that is lost from precursors rather than from the selective growth of cells Furthermore the loss of Ag expression on at least some activated cells is reversible in resting culture with almost half of the cells reverting to after the cessation of stimulation These experiments show that activation of T cells results in of surface homing receptors resulting in their inability to recognize and bind to the endothelial surface of HEV This suggests that the activation of T cells in vivo would result in a dramatic and physiologically significant change in their migration and

INSITU LOCALIZATION OF HUHF SERINE PROTEASE AND ANTIGENS IN HUMAN DERMATOSES A NOVEL METHOD FOR THE DETECTION OF CELLS IN AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PATHOLOGY Wood Mueller Warnke Weissman 1988 133 2 Abstract Human Hanukah Factor HuHF is a trypsinlike serine protease associated with cytotoxic T lymphocytes CTLs and natural killer NK cells Employing a radiolabeled RNA probe for the HuHF gene cells containing HuHF mRNA in situ were detected in skin lesions from patients with a variety of reactive and neoplastic dermatoses including positive allergic contact dermatitis patch tests lichen planus erythrodermic psoriasis Sezary syndrome and poikilodermatous mycosis fungoides The results were correlated with in situ studies of subsets as defined immunohistologically by a panel of monoclonal antibodies applied to sermiserial sections of the same tissue blocks used for the HuHF hybridizations The results suggest that cytotoxic cells are present in each of these dermatoses that they may be situated within either the epidermis or the dermis and that they belong predominantly to the CTL subset because or cells NK cells were typically rare or absent A variable proportion of cells expressed antigen a marker for cytotoxic cells however its rarity in several cases suggests that most of the cells identified in them belonged to the CTL subset It is concluded that the correlation of molecular

PHENOTYPICALLY AND FUNCTIONALLY HETEROGENEOUS JOURNAL OF IMMUNOLOGY Spangrude Weissman 1988 141 6 Abstract A limiting dilution system for cloning thymic CFU CFUt from murine bone marrow has been critically evaluated to test the clonal origin of the thymic colonies Simultaneous limiting dilution transfer of three populations of bone marrow each expressing a unique allelic cell surface determinant resulted in independent segregation of thymocyte populations within groups of recipient mice Statistical analysis of the data allowed an estimate of 1 x 10 4 transferred bone marrow cells A experiment was utilized to establish whether CFUt seed directly to the thymus or whether thymic seeding is secondary to engraftment The results supported the conclusion that bone marrow CFUt utilize a specific interaction with thymic blood vessel endothelial cells to recognize and enter the thymus and that this seeding occurs within 4 h of infusion A kinetic analysis of emigration of the CFUt progeny into the peripheral blood revealed that in most cases an early wave of predominantly lymphocytes emerges from the thymus approximately 4 wk after radiation and reconstitution In a few cases the first progeny of CFUt to emerge from the thymus were predominantly Commitment of CFUt to TCR rearrangements was assessed by quantitating expression of the V beta 8 family of TCR V region genes Although some clones expressed a significantly higher or lower percentage of V beta cells these differences were not stable with time Thus CFUt do not undergo absolute commitment to cell surface phenotype of TCR rearrangement as reflected by the phenotypes of their progeny Clones of mature peripheral progeny of CFUt could be expanded in culture in the presence of mitogen and growth factors approximately 30 to 50 of proliferating clones could mediate cytotoxicity in a assay further indicating that CFUt are not absolutely committed to a particular T cell function View details for Web of

transplantations fusion or rejection is controlled by genes of a highly polymorphic histocompatibility system that resembles in many respects the mammalian major histocompatibility complex MHC While fusion or rejection reactions are often completed within 24 hr after transplantation resorption of one partner of a pair of fused semiallogeneic colonies may occur days to weeks after initial contact The latter process is similar to the degeneration of old individuals or zooids that precedes maturation of each new generation of asexual buds Here we describe comparisons of in vitro reactions of a

A YEAST ENZYME INVIVO MOLECULAR AND CELLULAR BIOLOGY Carlson Weissman 1988 8 6 Abstract As part of an effort to develop a new means of inducibly inactivating cellular proteins in vivo three monoclonal antibodies which neutralize yeast alcohol dehydrogenase ADH activity were isolated and characterized with respect to criteria important for the inactivation strategy The significance of these criteria is considered and a general means of generating appropriate antibodies is suggested All three antibodies described here were specific for ADH I they did not recognize the closely related isozyme ADH II in a assay and did not immunoprecipitate molecules other than ADH from a Saccharomyces cerevisiae extract Neutralization occurred in a yeast extract and for two antibodies was blocked by high concentrations of the coenzyme This finding suggests that the antibodies may block enzyme activity by stabilizing an inactive form of ADH lacking bound These results provide a foundation for the use

peripheral lymphoid tissues showed major transient and some persistent disruptions in general thymic architecture and in thymic stromal components At 2 wk after total lymphoid irradiation TLI the thymus lacked identifiable medullary regions by immunohistochemical analyses Medullary stromal cells expression MHC Ag or a medullary epithelial cell Ag as well as medullary macrophages were undetectable Instead the processes of cortical epithelial cells were observed throughout the entire thymus Strikingly thymocyte subsets with mature phenotypes and were present in the apparent absence of a medulla This early gross effect was rapidly reversed such that by 1 to 2 mo after TLI medullary areas with MHC cells were evident However abnormalities in a subset of medullary stromal cells appeared to be more persistent Medullary epithelial cells identified by the MD1 mAb were greatly reduced in number and abnormally organized for at least 4 mo after TLI In addition macrophages containing endogenous peroxidase activity normally abundant in medullary regions were undetectable at all times examined after TLI Therefore this irradiation regimen induced both transient and long term effects in the thymus primarily in medullary regions These results suggest that TLI may be used as an experimental tool for studying the impact of selective depletion of medullary stromal cells

of responding to the thymic microenvironment with a productive commitment to the T cell lineage A second fraction of mouse bone marrow which expresses how levels of but is also positive for at least one of five hematolymphoid markers also contains cells that home to the thymus and establish colonies of thymocytes The two fractions each contribute approximately equal amounts of thymic units CFUt

Adkins Tidmarsh Weissman 1988 27 3 Abstract Nonlymphoid stromal cells in the mouse thymus are believed to be important in T cell maturation and have been proposed to play a central role in the acquisition of major histocompatibility complex MHC restriction and by maturing thymocytes Both cortical and medullary epithelial cells in the thymus express high levels of class II A major histocompatibility antigens MHC Ags We show here that a specific subset of these epithelial cells express a antigen 6C3Ag found previously on the surfaces of Abelson murine leukemia cells and on those bone stromal cell clones which support normal and preneoplastic cell proliferation Among solid lymphoid organs only the thymus contains cells and within the thymus this antigen is found exclusively on epithelial cells in cortical regions It is striking that the expression of the 6C3Ag on thymic epithelium is developmentally regulated suggesting a role for this lymphostromal antigen in the

Weissman 1988 167 3 Abstract The role of cytotoxic cells in in vivo immune functions such as allograft rejection is unknown To begin to assess the function of cytolytic cells in vivo we have begun with cytolytic functional molecules we have isolated and characterized cytolytic cDNA clones from cytolytic T cell clones both encoding distinct serine esterases The HF gene encodes a enzyme while the C11 gene encodes an enzyme with likely specificity for acidic residues Here we demonstrate using in situ hybridization with RNA probe that both genes are expressed selectively in a subset of T lymphocytes that have infiltrated cardiac allografts The phenotype of these cells is consistent with the most frequent phenotype of active CTL raised in vitro they are predominantly T cell blasts Thus the expression of these genes each of which encodes serine esterase found in killer cell granules in vitro is a valid marker for these cells in vivo as well The kinetics of their accumulation is consistent with but not proof of a putative role in allograft rejection It is likely that HF and C11 gene expression will be of diagnostic value View details for Web of Science ID A1988M691400028 View

unglycosylated molecular weight of The active enzyme is 71 and 77 similar to the mouse sequence at the amino acid and DNA level respectively The human and mouse sequences conserve the active site residues of serine proteases the and all 10 cysteine residues The gene for the human Hanukah factor serine protease is located on human chromosome 5 We propose that this serine protease may function

HOMING RECEPTORS AND METASTASIS ADVANCES IN CANCER RESEARCH SHER BARGATZE Holzmann Gallatin MATTHEWS Wu PICKER BUTCHER Weissman 1988 51 Abstract As discussed in the preceding sections there are several indications that the lymphocyte homing receptors involved in the normal process of lymphocyte recirculation are also relevant to the behavior of metastatic cells Cell fusion experiments indicate that previously nonmetastatic cells can acquire metastatic capacity from fusion with normal lymphocytes Murine T lymphomas that bear high levels of functional homing receptors can metastasize to peripheral lymphoid organs whereas those lymphomas lacking homing receptors can not Virtually all lymph node metastases of lymphomas contain a high proportion of cells even if the primary tumor has been selected to be relatively deficient in these cells Further investigations of the biology of lymphocyte homing receptors will reveal whether or not there are additional lymphocyte homing receptors and will clarify the role of lymphocyte homing receptors in metastasis Antibodies against three lymphocyte homing receptors could therefore be useful for diagnosis and treatment of metastatic disease

expressed when precursor cytotoxic T lymphocytes are transformed to T killer cells have been cloned and sequenced The derived amino acid sequences coding for cytotoxic cell protease 1 CCP1 and Hannuka factor HF are highly homologous to members of the serine proteinase family Comparative molecular model building using the known structures and the derived amino acid sequences of the lymphocyte enzymes has provided useful structural information especially in predicting the conformations of the substrate binding sites In applying this modelling procedure we used the structures of four serine proteinases to provide a structurally based sequence alignment CHT bovine trypsin BT Streptomyces griseus trypsin SGT and rat mast cell protease 2 RMCP2 The root mean square differences in atom positions among these four structures when compared in a pairwise fashion range from to A for structurally equivalent residues The sequences of the two lymphocyte enzymes were then aligned to these proteinases using chemical criteria and the superimposed structures as guides The alignment showed that the sequence of CCP1 was most similar to RMCP2 whereas HF has regions of homology with both RMCP2 and BT With RMCP2 as a template for CCP1 and the two enzymes RMCP2 and BT as templates for HF the molecular models were constructed Intramolecular steric clashes that resulted from the replacement of amino acid side chains of the templates by the aligned residues of CCP1 and HF were relieved by adjustment of the side chain conformational angles in an interactive computer graphics device This process was followed by energy minimization of the enzyme model to optimize the stereochemical geometry and to relieve any remaining unacceptably close nonbonded contacts The resulting model of CCP1 has an arginine residue at position 226 in the specificity pocket thereby predicting a substrate preference for P1 aspartate or glutamate residues The model also predicts favorable binding for a small hydrophobic residue at the P2 position of the substrate The primary specificity pocket of HF resembles that of BT and therefore predicts a lysine or arginine preference for the P1 residue The arginine at position 99 in the model of HF suggests a preference for aspartate or glutamate side chains in the P2 position of the substrate Both CCP1 and HF have a free cysteine in the segment of polypeptide 88 to 93 ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS View details for Web of Science ID A1988R339000005 View details for PubMedID 3237717 INDIRECT INDUCTION OF RADIATION LYMPHOMAS IN MICE EVIDENCE FOR A NOVEL TRANSMISSIBLE LEUKEMOGEN JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MEDICINE Lieberman HANSTEEN McCune Scott White Weissman 1987 166 6 Abstract The transmission of a lymphomagenic agent s from the bone marrow of irradiated mice to thymic target cells has been demonstrated by a the induction of T cell lymphomas in nonirradiated thymic grafts implanted in irradiated mice b the induction of T cell lymphomas of host origin in mice infused with bone marrow from irradiated donors The latter procedure also yields an appreciable number of cell lymphomas of uncertain origin The results confirm Kaplan theory that radiation induces thymic lymphomas in mice by an indirect mechanism However the previously described radiation leukemia virus is clearly not involved in the majority of transferred lymphomas We propose that the mediating agent in radiation lymphomagenesis is a novel transmissible agent induced in the bone marrow but exerting its transforming activity on cells in the thymus The

all four major and phenotypes Although all four phenotypes may be represented in a single clone quite often a striking bias in the proportion of L3T4 single positive to single positive cells may exist within a clone but not in the host thymocytes in general Because at any one time these clones may be located in specific subregions of the thymus specifically cortex only medulla only or cortex and

MEDICINE BARGATZE WU Weissman BUTCHER 1987 166 4 Abstract It has long been postulated that normal lymphocyte homing mechanisms help determine the metastatic spread of lymphoid neoplasms The traffic of normal lymphocytes is controlled in part by the regulated expression of surface receptors for high endothelial venules HEV specialized venules that mediate the extravasation of circulating lymphocytes from the blood into lymphoid organs and sites of chronic inflammation Here we have compared the in vivo growth patterns of nonbinding murine lymphomas passaged intramuscularly into syngeneic recipients We report that lymphomas that bind well to HEV as assessed in a quantitative in vitro assay disseminate widely via the blood involving all lymph node groups symmetrically Although both and nonbinding lymphomas gain access to the blood gross involvement of lymph nodes by nonbinding lymphomas is limited to nodes draining local tumor at the site of injection a prominent feature of these lymphomas distant lymph nodes are not enlarged The results suggest that the expression of functional receptors for HEV either controls the hematogenous dissemination of malignant lymphocyte populations to organs or is coregulated with factors determining this metastatic behavior The findings support the concept that normal lymphocyte homing mechanisms are important to the spread of

ALLELIC EXCLUSION AND THE DNA REARRANGEMENT PROCESS JOURNAL OF IMMUNOLOGY Nottenburg STJOHN Weissman 1987 139 5 Abstract Allelic exclusion of immunoglobulin gene products results in the expression of only one of two possible alleles in normal B lineage cells Attempts to define the role of heavy chain gene rearrangements in this process have revealed the nonexpressed allele to be rarely in its germline context but rather incompletely rearranged rearrangements or completely rearranged rearrangements and in a context that can not be expressed as a protein Nearly all DNA sequences of heavy chain genes from the nonexpressed allele have originated from plasmacytomas leukemias and hybridomas all clonal cell lines perhaps altered by the neoplastic process In this communication we present the first examples of isolation and DNA sequence analysis of heavy chain gene rearrangements from the nonexpressed allele of normal B lymphocytes Splenic B lymphocytes from allotype heterozygous X F1 mice expressing the IgD allotype were detected with a monoclonal antibody to the delta chain genetic marker and were isolated with a FACS cell sorter lambda phage clones containing the JH gene region from the sorted cells were isolated and those containing sequences derived from the nonexpressed chromosome were identified by a restriction fragment length polymorphism DNA sequences of seven rearranged clones from the nonexpressed allele are presented Five of these rearrangements have unexpected compositions Four of the five clones contain rearrangements with no obvious impediments to expression generated by the rearrangements The novel variable region gene in one of these rearrangements is a member of a newly described VH gene family The fifth clone has a kb deletion removing all of the JH gene segments The remaining two clones contain rearrangements that are typical of the initial stage of variable region assembly These findings suggest that the mechanisms that generate nontranslatable heavy chains do not exclusively account for allelic exclusion Rather several different mechanisms may contribute to the establishment of allelic exclusion in normal B lymphocytes View

antigen receptors and are often employed to study the molecular nature and the biological role of these antigen receptors Such antibodies are operationally defined as those antibodies which bind to a particular immunoglobulin but not to other immunoglobulins of the same class in a radioimmunoassay or ELISA The monoclonal antibodies 32D1 and 31D1 were initially defined as as they recognized an immunoglobulin preparation from the murine B cell lymphoma BCL1 but not other immunoglobulins of the same isotype as assessed by a radioimmunoassay A potential artifact in defining antibodies in this way is the possibility of copurification of antigen and antibody resulting in the tentative identification of as Previous studies have demonstrated that is involved in binding of murine leukemia virus MuLV and BCL1 immunoglobulin and apparently as an immune complex Disruption of the immune complexes with SDS and sucrose gradient purification of the immunoglobulin was adequate to prepare BCL1 immunoglobulin free of gp70 as assessed by radioimmunoassay with the monoclonal This preparation of immunoglobulin was used to show that 31D1 does not bind to BCL1 immunoglobulin but to the

rearrangements occur primarily or exclusively in the thymus although some gamma gene rearrangements occur outside the thymus in fetal liver cells that may be committed T cell progenitors There is no gross difference in the extent of beta and gamma gene rearrangements in the adult thymocyte subpopulations that were analyzed despite the fact that some of these populations can not respond to antigen and never emigrate from the thymus Quantitative analysis of rearrangements in total adult thymocyte DNA shows that beta gene rearrangements generally occur on both chromosomal homologs and that

RECEPTOR EXPRESSION IN THE MOUSE THYMUS JOURNAL OF IMMUNOLOGY REICHERT Jerabek Gallatin BUTCHER Weissman 1986 136 10 Abstract The monoclonal antibody has been used in conjunction with immunohistology and multiparameter immunofluorescence to identify and characterize homing thymocytes at various stages of embryonic and neonatal development thymocytes first appear at day 14 of gestation and come to represent about 40 of day 15 fetal thymocytes Thereafter the proportion of thymocytes rapidly declines such that by birth usually the 20th day of embryonic development only about 2 of thymocytes are Although newborn thymocytes resemble adult thymocytes in this respect the phenotypic characteristics of fetal and neonatal thymocytes suggest that this unique subset undergoes a gradual transition from containing exclusively phenotypically immature cells in early gestation to containing predominantly phenotypically mature cells by young adulthood Thus virtually none of day 15 fetal thymocytes are peanut agglutinin PNA lo or either or whereas in the weeks that follow a steadily greater proportion of thymocytes come to express this mature pattern roughly 70 at 4 wk of age Most day 15 fetal thymocytes appear to express the functional homing receptor molecule since day 15 fetal thymocytes bind to peripheral lymph node high endothelial venules about 40 to 50 as well as do adult mesenteric node lymphocytes whereas adult thymocytes bind only about 5 as well We have also identified a population of outer cortical lymphoblasts that appears during thymus regeneration 5 to 6 days after the administration of hydrocortisone These lymphoblasts express the same phenotype as cells that constitute 40 of the day 15 fetal thymus and only of normal adult thymocytes implying that this particular subset may make up a significant fraction of thymocytes whenever there is a requirement for rapid expansion of the intrathymic peripheral T cell pools Taken together these results are consistent with the notion that expression of the homing receptor may be closely linked to important intrathymic events that may occur early in T cell development and yet still have an overriding impact on the

cortex and many are phenotypically and functionally mature In this study we have used dual immunofluorescence techniques to further characterize those thymocytes resistant to cortisone treatment Aside

major source of thymus emigrants and c contain a high frequency of precursors of alloreactive cytotoxic T lymphocytes In this study we have analyzed the phenotype of the thymocyte subset Most normal adult thymocytes are midsize and express the mature phenotype typical of thymus emigrants medullary thymocytes and peripheral T cells they are predominantly PNAlo and either or These findings argue strongly for the presence of rare immunocompetent cortical thymocytes that aside from their homing receptor expression are phenotypically indistinguishable from medullary thymocytes However a minority 20 to 30 of thymocytes are large and phenotypically nonmature they express intermediate to high levels of PNA binding sites and are to and either or Through a technique that selectively labels outer cortical cells phenotypically nonmature thymocytes have been shown to be concentrated in the subcapsular blast region of the outer cortex Although we have no direct evidence of a relationship we consider it likely that the phenotypically nonmature outer cortical lymphoblasts give rise to phenotypically mature cells located deeper in the cortex These results are consistent with our previous proposal that thymocytes are a major source of thymus emigrants and indicate that expression of high levels of homing receptors may be closely linked to the intrathymic selection process View details

defined by resides in the carboxyl terminal proteolytic peptide of ubiquitin but is undetected in intact undenatured ubiquitin and other cellular ubiquitinated proteins Antisera and monoclonal

surface gag protein whether in its glycosylated or unglycosylated state but does not detect the cytoplasmic precursor of the virion gag proteins Pr65gag Based on these findings we have localized the determinant to the unique part of the glycosylated gag polyprotein the L domain We have determined that gp95gag contains determinants whereas gp85gag lacks the carboxyterminal p10 determinant and gp55gag lacks both p30 and p10 carboxy terminal determinants Analysis of cell surface gag expression with the antibody leads us to propose that the L domain plays a crucial role in i the insertion and orientation of murine leukemia virus gag polyproteins in the cell membrane and ii the relative abundance of expression of AKR leukemia virus versus Moloney murine leukemia virus glycosylated gag

The traffic of lymphocytes is controlled in part by the selective interaction of circulating lymphocytes with specialized high endothelial venule HEV cells at sites of lymphocyte exit from the blood At least three independent receptor systems are responsible for controlling lymphocyte traffic to different lymphoid organs or to sites of inflammation one mediates lymphocyte interaction with HEV in peripheral lymph nodes another in lymphoid tissues and a third in inflamed synovium The receptors mediating lymphocyte recognition of HEV in different organs appear to be structurally related yet antigenically and functionally distinct 90 kD glycoproteins Receptors for lymph node HEV can function as mammalian lectins and probably interact with specific carbohydrate ligands on high endothelial cells Mouse and human homing receptors share both antigenic and structural features indicating a high conservation of recognition systems during evolution They play an essential part in the immune process by controlling lymphocyte traffic during and differentiation and by segregating effector cells derived from stimulation in different tissues thus simultaneously increasing the efficiency of immune responses and decreasing possibilities for autoimmune crossreactions Homing receptors are also expressed by many mouse and human lymphoid neoplasms and appear to play a role in lymphoma metastasis Related if not identical receptors are expressed by other leukocyte types including polymorphonuclear leukocytes monocytes and large granular lymphocytes natural killer cells Thus lymphocyte homing receptors are members of a family of glycoprotein receptors for endothelium that control the extravasation of lymphocytes as well as other leukocytes and help regulate both and

Gallatin Weissman 1985 2 1 Abstract Although cloned lines of T lymphocytes have been valuable in defining the in vitro functions of cell types they have often demonstrated relatively poor activity in vivo One striking property of T cells clones which might affect their in vivo activity is their unusual inability to localized in lymphoid tissue as do most normal T cells Normal lymphocyte recirculation and localization requires that lymphocytes recognize and pass through the walls of specialized high endothelial venules HEV as they enter into lymph nodes We previously showed that murine T cell clones are unable to home into the peripheral lymphoid nodes and Peyer patches The inability of these cells to recognize lymph node HEV in an in vitro frozen section adherence assay suggested that the lack of lymphoid homing was due to the loss of a normal lymphocyte surface receptor for HEV The present experiments were designed to determine 1 the molecular mechanism responsible for the loss of normal lymphocyte migration and 2 whether these migration and homing characteristics are irreversible features of T cell clones Flow cytometric analysis of helper and cytolytic clones using a monoclonal antibody specific for the lymphocyte homing receptor showed that they lack this surface receptor This lack of receptor expression was confirmed by the inability to detect the antigen in extracts of cells Thus the lack of homing to lymph nodes appears to be due to the loss of expression of the surface receptor which mediates the interaction between lymphocytes and HEV When clones were rested in vitro in a nonproliferative state without stimulation by antigen or growth factors they did not regain expression of the surface homing receptor or the ability to migrate to lymph nodes in vivo The lack of receptor expression therefore is not merely associated with a rapidly proliferating state but rather seems to be an irreversible feature of T cell clones at least under in vitro culture conditions T cell clones both rested and recently restimulated share certain features characteristic of activated T cells as shown by recent results with T cell blasts Both populations are large brightly lymphocytes which lack expression of the receptor and do not home to peripheral lymphoid tissue We propose that this nonrecirculating phenotype may represent a normal phase of T cell differentiation through which many T cells pass after being activated by specific antigen ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS View details for Web of Science ID A1985AEC2300004 View

Abstract Henry Kaplan helped establish the fields of lymphocyte biology and viral leukemogenesis by his early and continuing studies on radiation leukemogenesis As one of Henry students I carried on these dual preoccupations with thymic lymphocytopoiesis and thymic lymphomagenesis This communication demonstrates that thymic lymphocytes are derived from bone marrow precursors which lack any T cell markers these bone marrow cells or their clonogenic subsets can give rise to either thymic cortical plus medullary progeny or medullary progeny alone thymic lymphocytes mature in contact with classes of nonlymphoid cells thymic nurse cells cortical dendritic epithelial cells medullary epithelial cells dendritic reticular cells and macrophages and one of these subsets cortical dendritic epithelial cells express an unusual distribution of MHC antigen perhaps utilized in the maturation of T cell MHC restriction the population of cells which are poised to emigrate from the thymus are a unique

place in the thymus perhaps influenced by the operation of stringent selection mechanisms whose existence has been inferred from the high rate of thymocyte turnover in the absence of extensive emigration The origin of those 1 of total thymocytes which leave the thymus and seed the peripheral lymphoid organs is obscure Recent thymic emigrants are functionally and phenotypically mature and the purported greater maturity of medullary relative to cortical thymocytes is often cited a evidence for the medullary origin of thymic emigrants a suggestion not without its critics To approach this question we have now isolated a a subpopulation of thymocytes expressing high levels of a receptor that mediates the homing of lymphocytes into peripheral lymph nodes Surprisingly this population of cells of total thymocytes is both cortical and immunocompetent containing approximately half of all thymic cytolytic precursors The combination of homing receptor expression and immunocompetence makes this cortical population ideally suited for emigration to peripheral lymphoid organs View details for Web of Science ID A1985AAB1100056 View details for PubMedID 3871507 GERMINAL CENTER CELLS CLASS

HOMING CORTICAL THYMOCYTE SUBSET IMPLICATIONS FOR MIGRATION AND THE NATURE OF THYMOCYTES CELL REICHERT Gallatin BUTCHER Weissman 1984 38 1 Abstract The thymus exports a selected subset of virgin T lymphocytes to the peripheral lymphoid organs The mature phenotype of these thymus emigrants is similar to that of medullary thymocytes and has been cited as supporting a medullary rather than cortical exit site Using the monoclonal antibody we identify a 1 subpopulation of thymocytes that expresses high levels of a receptor molecule involved in lymphocyte homing to peripheral lymph nodes We present evidence that these rare thymocytes are predominantly of mature phenotype and represent the major source of thymus emigrants Surprisingly thymocytes are exclusively cortical in location although their mature phenotype may allow them to masquerade as medullary cells in conventional studies We also demonstrate that unlike medullary thymocytes many thymocytes CRT are Thus in contrast to current dogma CRT do not represent a sample of medullary thymocytes as they are found in situ and their level of immunocompetence does not necessarily reflect that of the medullary population Our findings refute the hypothesis that phenotypically and functionally mature cells are restricted to the medulla and support our proposition that most thymus emigrants are derived from the cortical

KYEWSKI B A 1984 132 5 Abstract Thymocyte subpopulations that associate in vivo with distinct nonlymphoid cells of the thymus have been isolated and their immunocompetence was analyzed Previous studies have indicated that greater than 95 of such cells bear a surface antigen phenotype representative of immature thymocytes and are among the earliest thymic compartments repopulated by bone cells after lethal and irradiation Stromal thymocytes may be activated in vivo because they proliferate well in vitro with no additional stimulus and show little increase in proliferation with the addition of T cell mitogens or allogeneic spleen cells Stromal T cells contain cytotoxic T lymphocyte CTL precursors that are indistinguishable from mature peripheral T cells by the parameters of self tolerance alloreactivity restriction and stringency of self preference CTL precursor frequencies and the cytotoxic activity of cells further separated on the basis of high levels of expression argue against the possibility that stromal CTL activity is due solely to contaminating mature lymphocytes Our data suggest that stromal thymocytes represent an intermediate subpopulation of thymocytes that is functionally mature and that expresses an immature surface phenotype Furthermore the imposition of self tolerance and MHC restriction specificity appears to be tightly associated with the acquisition of immunocompetence in these thymocyte subpopulations View details for Web of Science ID A1984SN37200019 View details for PubMedID 6609194 Lymphoid tissues and organs Fundamental

lymphocyte CTL activity can be derived from cultures of thymocyte responders and minor H different spleen cell stimulators As is the case of the spleen cell response previously reported this cytotoxic activity requires in vivo priming We performed several experiments designed to determine whether the in vivo priming effect is due to the in situ priming of the thymocyte CTL precursors to contamination of thymus cell preparations with cells of neighboring lymph nodes or to the appearance in the thymus of peripheral T cells We show by depletion of peripheral cells with antilymphocyte serum and part body irradiation that recent thymic immigrants derived from the bone marrow contribute to the primed thymic response Thymic CTL were primed in animals in which peripheral T cell responses were completely eliminated by repeated treatment in vivo with monoclonal reagents Primed lymph node cells were also demonstrated to contribute to the CTL response Thus the minor thymic CTL response is due both to in situ priming and the immigration of activated peripheral T cells We discuss the possible significance for models of T cell differentiation of the presence within the thymus

Weissman 1984 81 14 Abstract In an effort to identify cellular proteins that may be involved in the Abelson murine leukemia virus transformation process we have isolated a hybridoma antibody 6C3 that

Abstract The thymus is the major if not the sole site of maturation of T lymphocytes from their haematopoietic precursors During embryonic life at a few intervals at least in birds the thymus receives haematopoietic precursors that give rise to functional T lymphocytes Although the number and thymic location of distinct lineages destined to form the peripheral pool are not yet well defined at least two independent pathways have been proposed First thymic subcapsular lymphoblasts divide and differentiate to give rise to small deep cortical thymic lymphocytes medullary lymphocytes and thymus emigrants unpublished data and second the medulla contains an independent population that contains the precursors of the peripheral pool Following irradiation the thymus may be repopulated by injected haematopoietic cells presumably related to the haematopoietic cells of the embryo Here we have reconstituted irradiated mice with limiting numbers of bone marrow cells from congeneic donors and have found distinct clones of cells within the thymus The pattern of reconstitution by the precursor cells indicates that two independent thymus lineages exist cortex plus medulla and medulla alone View

by recirculatory and microenvironmental factors Specific interactions between recirculating lymphocytes and high endothelial venules in various lymphoid organs determine the presence and proportions of the various lymphoid sets and subsets in those organs Separate endothelial determinants on peripheral node and Peyer patch endothelium along with complementary lymphocyte receptors mediate this organ specificity B and T cells also exhibit nonrandom organization within lymphoid tissues after entry via high endothelial venules they segregate into their respective domains which appear to be determined by distinct types of nonlymphoid stromal cells Antigenic stimulation results in changes in lymphocyte phenotype as well as in the lymphoid microenvironment The response to most complex antigens is the formation of germinal centers GC composed primarily of proliferating B cells the phenotype of the few T cells therein is supportive of the GC as a site of interaction The phenotype of

questions 1 At what stage in normal cell development do immunoglobulin gene rearrangements occur and 2 Do heavy chain and kappa light chain genes rearrange in concert or in an ordered sequence To answer these questions we studied immunoglobulin gene rearrangements in cell populations purified on the cell sorter FACS Gene rearrangement was assessed by measuring the loss of joining J restriction fragments in B cells and two populations of cells Large cells the earliest identifiable cells in the B lineage have rearrangements at both JH loci but do not have rearrangements at the kappa chain loci Thus heavy chain rearrangement occurs concurrently with or prior to the expression of the surface marker B220 which we use to identify and isolate cells Small cells which include the immediate precursors of B cells likewise have rearrangements at both JH loci but may also have J kappa rearrangements Approximately of the J kappa loci are rearranged in small cells compared to in kappa B cells This suggests that the small cell population is actively undergoing kappa chain gene rearrangement The striking asynchrony in heavy and light chain gene rearrangement is reflected at the level of gene expression both cell populations synthesize mu chains but not kappa light chains Heavy chain rearrangement is therefore a very early event in B lineage development and may begin in a cell not yet fully committed to the B lineage whereas kappa rearrangement occurs just prior to the expression of surface immunoglobulin sIg and may be a step in the transition from to B cells View details for Web

Abstract To detect a strong cytotoxic T lymphocyte CTL response to minor histocompatibility H antigens in a mixed lymphocyte culture it is necessary to use a responder that has been primed in vivo with cells It has previously been shown that CTL can be primed in vivo both directly by foreign spleen cells and by presentation of foreign minor H antigens on host cells This latter route is evident in the phenomenon of in which heterozygous A x B F1 mice injected 2 wk previously with minor A spleen cells generate both and CTL In a study of the kinetics of to minors in F1 mice we have found that minor T cells actually suppress the induction of virgin CTL capable of recognizing them CTL activity measured from F1 mice d after injection with viable A spleen cells is largely restricted The response recovers such that roughly equal and activity is detected in mice as early as d postinjection This temporary hyporeactivity does not result from generalized immunosuppression it is specific for those CTL that recognize the foreign minor H antigen in the context of the antigens on the injected spleen cells The injected spleen cells that mediate this suppression are radiosensitive T cells T cells are highly efficient at suppressing the induction of CTL in vivo No graft host reaction by the injected T cells appears to be required as suppression of direct primed CTL can be mediated by spleen cells that are wholly tolerant of both host and minor H antigens Suppression can not be demonstrated by in vitro mixing experiments Several possible mechanisms for suppression are discussed including inactivation of responding CTL by veto cells and in vivo sequestration of responding CTL by the injected spleen cells View details for Web of Science ID A1983PX64900012 View details for

Alexander Johnson ROSEN Jerabek Green Weissman Lerner A 1983 306 5944 Abstract Recent studies have shown that short chemically synthesized peptides very often induce antibodies which react with the cognate sequence in the intact folded protein Since such antibodies react with known regions of proteins they are of predetermined specificity and offer a precision not previously possible with immunological probes A basic concept emerging from the use of such antibodies in viral systems is that the differential immunogenicity of closely related proteins can be mimicked by short peptides which span the regions of sequence variation To generalize this concept we have studied the two proteins which vary by only a single amino acid Chemically synthesized peptides differing in only one out of 19 amino acids were able to induce allospecific antisera Thus single amino acid changes have similar effects on the immunogenicity of proteins and small peptides even though the latter are free

In in vivo homing studies T cells localized consistently more efficiently than T cells in Peyer patches about times as well whereas both populations localized roughly equivalently in peripheral lymph nodes These homing characteristics of and subsets are largely independent of their organ source The specificity of migration appears to be determined by selective recognition of determinants on the endothelial cells of high endothelial venules HEV specialized venules that mediate the exit of migrating lymphocytes from the blood In an in vitro assay of lymphocyte binding to HEV in lymphoid organ frozen sections cells constituted a significantly and consistently greater proportion of T cells binding to Peyer patch HEV than of those binding to peripheral node HEV The homing and HEV recognition preferences of the Lyt subsets are reflected in differences in their in situ representation in mucosal vs nonmucosal lymphoid organs which suggests that the selective migration of these populations

studies and b an in vitro assay of lymphocyte binding to high endothelial venules HEV in frozen sections of Peyer patches and peripheral lymph nodes In the in vivo experiments intravenously injected GCLC failed to migrate in significant numbers to peripheral lymphoid organs in comparison with T cells or B cells In the in vitro binding assay GCLC did not adhere to HEV in either Peyer patch or peripheral node sections A variety of factors such as preferential sequestration in the liver may operate in vivo to influence the localization of these cells However their nearly total failure to migrate into lymphoid organs can best be explained by their inability to recognize and adhere to the specialized HEV which normally mediate the emigration of recirculating lymphocytes from the blood into these sites The concept that GCLC fail to express functional homing receptors for HEV has been further supported by studies using a monoclonal antibody that appears to recognize the lymphocyte surface receptor for peripheral node HEV In contrast to most peripheral lymphocytes GCLC fail to bind These migratory and properties of GCLC when viewed in the context of the possible role of these cells as precursors of plasma cells memory B cells have led us to propose that the inability of GCLC to recognize HEV may be transient and related to a phase of sessile B cell differentiation View

Several in vitro T cell clones were markedly deficient in their ability to home to peripheral lymphoid tissue This was found for an alloreactive noncytolytic clone a soluble KLH specific line and cytotoxic clones specific for allogeneic cells and for Abelson lymphoma cells This abnormal circulation pattern was probably caused by the lack of the receptors of the lymphocytes for high endothelial venules HEV as implied by the lack of binding of these T cells to HEV in frozen sections of mouse lymph node and Peyer patches The loss of surface receptors that are necessary for normal lymphocyte migration may thereby alter the in vivo function of adoptively transferred T cells View details for Web of Science ID A1982NL17700035 View details for PubMedID 6460817 Functional considerations of

segment has joined to the JH4 gene segment but no joining has occurred We present evidence that D gene segments lie as a cluster between V and J gene segments in the germ line A comparison of

to be restricted to lymphoid and accessory cells Class I A B and C antigens are also present on thymic epithelial cells They are easily detectable on medullary epithelial cells but two distinct patterns of cortical staining were observed One group of antibodies produced intense dendritic staining throughout the cortex the other group produced only faint or no cortical dendritic staining at all These different staining patterns do not correlate with known properties of the antibodies and thus appear to be due to intrinsic properties of the different A B and C antigens View details for

growth of syngeneic lymphoma cells was studied 1E4 is an cytotoxic clone that efficiently kills Abelson lymphoma target cells at low ratios as measured by in vitro cytotoxicity assays In addition it is long lived in vitro in the absence of stimulation and survives for more than 1 wk in vivo in the absence of exogenous antigen or growth factors Mice injected intraperitoneally with lethal doses of and then treated with 1E4 survived longer than animals treated with saline or with a control clone Multiple weekly injections of effector cells or a single injection in animals given a low dose of tumor cells resulted in survivors The observation that intravenous injection of killer cells was less effective than intraperitoneal treatment coupled with the previous demonstration of markedly abnormal circulatory patterns for clones suggests that those animals succumbing to progressively growing neoplasm die because the effector cells are unable to home into peripheral sites of tumor deposition Thus although this cytotoxic clone does have useful in vivo activity its function may be partially limited by a generalized defect in migration View details for Web of Science ID

center lymphoid cells in the mouse is described It is confirmed that most germinal center lymphocytes bind high levels of peanut agglutination PNA a lectin with specificity for terminal galactosyl residues It is shown that germinal center lymphocytes can be identified in cell suspensions as a discrete PNAhi population distinct from other B cells plasma cells and most T cells which bind only low levels of PNA Using PNA as a marker in dual fluorescence studies we found that the majority of Peyer patch germinal center cells are B lymphocytes PNAhi Peyer patch cells express B220 the B form of the T200 family of molecules as well as low levels of surface Ig They do not express the T antigens or only 1 to 3 positive They bear lower levels of than PNAlo B cells but two to three times the level of surface determinants A discrete but variable subpopulation of PNAhi Peyer patch cells bear ThB in mice but PNAhi lymphocytes are About 10 to 30 bear surface IgM or IgG but in contrast to essentially all PNAlo B lymphocytes in this site they express no detectable surface IgD The majority of Peyer patch germinal center cells bear surface IgA and this IgA is allelically excluded in F1 mice indicating it is synthesized by the germinal center cells themselves In fact germinal centers contain most of the cells in Peyer patches 70 to 85 These findings lend considerable support to the concept that germinal centers in Peyer patches are the site of generation of precursors of the plasma cells that characterize mucosal immune responses and also suggest that germinal centers may play

Abstract The migration of B and T lymphocytes in the mouse has been studied by using 1 in vivo homing studies and 2 an in vitro assay of lymphocyte binding to specialized lymphoid organ venules high endothelial venules HEV in frozen sections of lymph nodes and Peyer patches The homing characteristics of B and T cell populations are largely independent of their organ of origin B cells from any source distribute preferentially to Peyer patches whereas T cells home preferentially to peripheral lymph nodes This organ specificity of migration appears to be determined at the site of lymphocyte exit from the blood by selective recognition of determinants on the endothelial cells of HEV In addition the in vivo tendency of B cells to migrate preferentially to the spleen and of T cells to localize better in lymph nodes is confirmed The results indicate that in a hypothetical situation in which an equal number of B and T lymphocytes localized in peripheral lymph nodes or bound in vitro to peripheral node HEV there would be about B cells for every T cell in the mesenteric node four to six B cells per T cell in Peyer patches and seven to nine B cells per T cell in the spleen Comparison of these homing preferences with the distribution of B and T lymphocyte populations in situ suggests that selective lymphocyte migration may help determine the proportions of functionally distinct lymphocyte classes in particular lymphoid organs or sites of chronic inflammation and thus may serve to influence the character of local immune responses View details for Web of Science ID

patch germinal center cells are B cells with a unique phenotype express a low level of surface immunoglobulin about 85 predominantly of the IgA class 70 with only 10 bearing surface IgM and few if any expressing IgD This phenotype identifies murine Peyer patch germinal center cells as fairly late cells in B cell differentiation and suggests that they may be precursors of plasma cells in the gut wall In addition we have described a means of purifying Peyer patch lymphocytes and have demonstrated that these cells lack functional receptors for high endothelial venules and fail to migrate to lymphoid organs in vivo It is speculated that PNA may be a general marker for nonmigratory lymphocyte populations undergoing local differentiation View details for Web of Science ID A1982PL44700107

cells that occur in areas of lymphoid tissues after antigenic stimulation They are believed to be associated with the development of memory and plasma cell especially secondary IgG and IgA responses Recent studies of murine lymphoid tissues have defined markers that distinguish germinal centre B cells from other mature B cells permitting their identification and characterization in cell suspensions Here we have used these markers to define and study germinal centre cells in lympho nodes and have found that they constitute a unique population of B cells which 1 arises in response to antigenic stimulation 2 contains nearly all of the demonstrably B cells in the stimulated organ 3 bears surface IgM after primary stimulation and 4 as a population demonstrates isotype switching to a predominant population demonstrates isotype switching to a predominant surface IgG phenotype after secondary stimulation with specific surface IgG phenotype after secondary stimulation with specific antigen These findings demonstrate that germinal centres are a major site of proliferation and differentiation of B cells in vivo and suggest that the germinal centre microenvironment may have an important role in heavy chain class switching during responses View details for Web of Science ID A1982NY37400044 View details for PubMedID 6806671 PROTOCHORDATE ALLORECOGNITION IS CONTROLLED BY A

AUGMENTATION BY AS OPPOSED TO INHIBITION BY PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF SCIENCES Hollander Pillemer Weissman 1981 78 2 Abstract Monoclonal alpha and alpha manifest inverse effects on allogeneic mixed lymphocyte reactions when added to the reaction mixtures without complement alpha augments cell proliferation and generation of cytotoxic cells but has no effect on cytolysis whereas alpha blocks cell proliferation generation of killer cells and cytolytic activity of killer cells The augmenting effect of alpha can not be attributed to a direct mitogenic effect on T cells Both inhibition by alpha and potentiated by alpha require interaction of responder cells with the antibodies during the first 24 hr of the mixed lymphocyte reaction indicating that early stages of the reaction are sensitive to Lyt antibodies The enhancing effect of alpha on proliferation is associated with augmented production of growth factors When alpha is present in mixed lymphocyte cultures the supernatant media collected after 24 or 48 hr of culture induce higher proliferation of activated T cells compared to media of mixed lymphocyte cultures incubated in the absence of antibodies or in the presence of alpha which has no effect on secretion of growth factors The differences in the effects of alpha and alpha could not be attributed to differences in heavy chain constant region functions because both were of the same lambda 2A immunoglobulin class and were used at the same concentration The data suggest a possible role for molecules in early activation

the C delta gene One of these clones also contains the C mu gene The C delta gene is separated from the C mu membrane exons by approximately 2 kilobases kb of DAN The C delta gene was identified by a hybridization to poly A RNA prepared from the rat plasma cell tumor IR731 and b homology of a translated nucleotide sequence to the amino acid sequence of the human delta chain The C delta gene spans 8 kb of DNA in the germ line Plasmid subclones of the C delta gene were used as probes in Southern and RNA blot experiments RNA blot analysis of cytoplasmic poly A RNA from IR731 and a mu delta hybridoma revealed and delta mRNA species with different 3 ends which presumably encode the secreted and forms respectively of the delta chain Southern blot analysis of DNA from two mu delta lymphomas revealed that the C delta gene is in the configuration in each case Restriction map analysis of C mu and C delta genomic clones isolated from a library of normal mu delta DNA also gave no evidence for DNA rearrangement in the region between the C mu and C delta genes Taken together these data suggest that IgD expression in mu delta B cells does not involve a V H delta DNA switch rearrangement We propose that simultaneous expression of C delta and C delta with a single V H gene is mediated by two alternative routes of RNA processing of a primary nuclear transcript which contains the V H C mu and C delta genes In contrast analogous experiments with myeloma IR731 DNA revealed that the C mu gene has been deleted from the myeloma DNA and that the C delta gene has undergone DNA rearrangement presumably including a switch recombination of the V H gene from the C mu to the C delta gene These results indicate that two alternative mechanisms may be used in the expression of IgD splicing in B

hybridizing clones representing three separate cloning events We determined the sequence of the coding and immediate flanking regions of three clones representing the three separate cloning events and they proved to be identical This sequence encoded the amino acid sequence of neither MOPC 167 nor MOPC 511 but required four base pair changes to generate the V kappa M167 cDNA sequence and five base

genes on both the expressed and nonexpressed chromosomes of normal B lymphocytes from allotype heterozygous X F1 mice The C mu genes of mice are on EcoRI and Kpn I restriction fragments whereas those of mice are on EcoRI and Kpn I restriction fragments allowing the examination of rearrangements on each chromosome independently B lymphocytes from spleen and Peyer patches expressing both IgD and IgM of the allotype were isolated with a cell sorter EcoRI and Kpn I restriction digests were hybridized with a C mu probe The C mu gene is present on both chromosomes DNA rearrangements occur on both the expressed and nonexpressed chromosome within the Kpn restriction fragment containing the joining JH gene locus We conclude that allelic exclusion of immunoglobulin gene expression is not mediated by DNA rearrangement of the expressed chromosome only In contrast analysis of the C kappa gene region from the same sorted DNA reveals a substantial quantity of context DNA We also demonstrate that the deletions observed on the Eco RI fragment containing the C mu gene in myeloma cells and in C mu recombinant DNAs do not usually occur in normally differentiating B lymphocytes and are likely to be

MATURATION THYMOCYTE AND THYMUS MIGRANT DEFINED WITH TO THE ANTIGENS AND THB JOURNAL OF IMMUNOLOGY Scollay Weissman 1980 124 6 Abstract The phenotypes of thymus cells for the antigens and ThB have been analyzed by using immunofluorescence techniques Cells throughout the intrathymic maturation sequence have been tested including the primitive subcapsular lymphoblasts all size classes of cortical and medullary thymocytes and thymus cell emigrants ThB antigen is not detectable on migrant cells but all subpopulations in the thymus are subdivided into two categories bright and dull Thus it is possible that the bright and dull phenotypes represent a lineage specific rather than a marker at least inside the thymus The thymocyte subclasses and Lyt are also both represented in all subpopulations including subcapsular lymphoblasts This suggests that they may represent two separate lineages and that the 3 class is not a precursor of the class although the possibility of a very

interfere with interactions should inhibit proliferation Rat monoclonal antibodies were raised to the AKR mouse T lymphoma and these antibodies were screened independently for blockade of and for cytostatic activity on cells We report here that those monoclonal antibodies which block virus binding inhibit growth of cells in vitro whereas monoclonal antibodies which bind to these cells but do not block virus binding are not cytostatic Three of the four cytostatic antibodies detect determinants on the molecule while none of the other noncytostatic antibodies detect Antibody inhibition of

interaction of lymphocytes with specialized endothelial cells Mouse Peyer patch and lymph node lymphocytes bind preferentially to high endothelial venules HEV in frozen sections of Peyer patches and peripheral nodes respectively and this in vitro binding preference accurately predicts their differential segregation in vivo 30 min after injection Both in vivo and in vitro about times as many as many Peyer patch as lymph node lymphocytes bind HEV in Peyer patches and conversely twice as many lymph node cells interact with HEV in nonmesenteric lymph nodes Even greater specificity is shown by certain homogeneous lymphocyte populations thymic lymphomas Some lymphomas bind with remarkable selectivity to HEV in Peyer patches and others interact almost exclusively with those in lymph nodes indicating that the mechanisms mediating selective recognition of HEV are capable of nearly absolute discrimination Mesenteric node HEV are unique in that they allow both Peyer and lymph cells to bind It is proposed that lymphocyte surface receptors specific for endothelial cell determinants mediate the organ specificity of lymphocyte migration According to this model there are at least 2 sets of complementary lymphocyte and endothelial cell receptors one mediating adherence in Peyer patches the other in lymph nodes View details for Web of Science ID A1980KG04100012 View details for PubMedID 6157544 MIGRATION QUANTITATIVE ASPECTS OF CELLULAR TRAFFIC FROM THE THYMUS TO THE PERIPHERY IN MICE EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF IMMUNOLOGY SCOLLAY BUTCHER Weissman 1980 10 3 Abstract We have used intrathymic injection of fluorescein isothiocyanate to label thymocytes in situ The method gives random labeling of the thymocyte population and so can be used to quantitate the extent of migration of cells from the thymus to the periphery Migrant cells can be visualized in frozen sections or cell suspensions of peripheral organs by their fluorescence Our data show that in young adults about 1 of thymocytes leave the thymus per day Since the bulk of thymocytes turn over every 5 to 7 days this indicates that the vast majority 95 of thymocytes die within the thymus Cells that do leave the thymus go mainly to the T areas of lymph nodes spleen and Peyer patches Migrants are extremely rare in bone marrow gut and liver Migration is about the same in neonates as in adults relative to the size of the thymus but is considerably lower in older animals where it is only about of thymocytes per day at the age of six months View details for Web of Science ID A1980JQ94600009 View details for PubMedID 7379836

defined which 1 do not significantly affect immediate or long term viability of lymphocytes up to 2 weeks after transfer in vivo 2 do not alter normal lymphocyte migration 3 do not affect expression

RHODAMINE ISOTHIOCYANATE TECHNICAL ASPECTS JOURNAL OF IMMUNOLOGICAL METHODS BUTCHER Weissman 1980 37 2 Abstract A rapid and simple method of cell labeling by stable conjugation with fluorescein or rhodamine is described Viable cells are incubated under benign conditions near physiologic pH in normal media with free fluorescein or tetramethyl rhodamine isothiocyanate and are adequately separated from unreacted fluorochrome by washing or centrifugation through fetal calf serum The effects of the pH the time and temperature of incubation and the concentration of cells fluorochrome and free protein in the media are described The method labels all cell types although to different degrees Fluorescence microscopy reveals fluorescence throughout the cell although chromatin appears relatively spared Cellular fluorescence is fairly stable at 4 and 25 degrees C decays rapidly at 37 degrees C but is nonetheless visible for days even at this temperature In the case of lymphocytes intense fluorescence is obtained without affecting cell viability and without alteration of the ability to mount a graft versus host response View details for Web of Science ID A1980KM67800001 View details

sequences of thymocytes is known to some extent A generative layer of subcapsular large lymphoblasts gives rise to a major population of small cortical thymocytes and a minor population of midsize medullary thymocytes The relative contribution of these three populations to the peripheral T cell populations is not yet known In this study subcapsular lymphoblasts cortical small cells medullary cells and thymic emigrant cells have all been analyzed by immunofluorescence for expression of the antigens and TL is expressed brightly on all subcapsular large cells dimly on cortical small cells and brightly on all migrants thymocytes CRT and peripheral T cells can be detected at low levels on 30 to 50 of cells in all the thymic subpopulations and on 30 to 50 of migrants and peripheral T cells Fifty to 80 of small cortical cells do not express detectable but all the other subpopulations both inside and outside the thymus stain uniformly quite brightly TL3 is expressed on 70 to 80 of subcapsular and cortical thymocytes 30 to 40 of CRT is undetectable on migrants but can be seen at low levels on 10 to 20 of spleen and lymph node T cells The possibility that some or all of these antigens represent stable markers of separate lineages rather than unstable markers is discussed View details for Web of Science ID A1980JT75200051 View details for PubMedID 6154739 DISTRIBUTION OF IN

histocompatibility complex MHC are differentially expressed in the mouse thymus Immunoperoxidase studies of frozen thymus sections incubated with monoclonal hybridoma antibodies revealed a dendritic straining pattern in the cortex and a confluent staining pattern in the medulla Serial sections incubated with monoclonal antibodies showed that antigens were only present at detectable levels in the medulla Microenvironments expressing antigens also expressed antigens In regions relatively large areas were found These areas appeared to connect to perivascular spaces surrounding blood vessels Using a new postfixation labeling method for the detection of cell surface associated antigens on cells of the lymphoid system in situ we have characterized the nature of MHC positive cell types at the ultrastructural level These studies show that cells are the major MHC positive elements in the thymus Lymphocytes in the medulla and in bounderies are also MHC positive however lymphocytes in the cortex were not detectably labeled These findings support the contention that cells are involved in the process during T cell maturation View details for Web of Science ID A1980KG73500007 View details

locus The only exceptions are cells of XX genotype after inactivation of one X chromosome and cells in each case only one of the two alleles is expressed in differentiated cells and their progeny This phenomenon termed allelic exclusion has been described for several mammalian species including man and mouse It has been shown that the variable V and constant C region genes of immunoglobulins undergo a rearrangement during ontogeny We wished to test whether allelic exclusion in B cells could be the consequence of and rearrangement on one of the two homologous chromosomes only For that reason we chose to analyse the rearrangement of immunoglobulin light chain genes in normal B lymphocytes isolated on the cell sorter We now present evidence that during normal differentiation rearrangement occurs only on one chromosome View details for Web of Science ID A1980JJ08900046 View details for PubMedID 6244500 RETROVIRAL RECEPTORS AND CONTROL OF COLD SPRING HARBOR SYMPOSIA ON

lymphoid cells was determined quantitatively using microfluorometric analysis and a radioimmunoassay Paraformaldehyde and solutions preserved the antigenicity of cell immunoglobulin antigens when used in concentrations ranging from to 4 However glutaraldehyde destroyed the antigenicity of and Thy molecules at concentrations higher than Electron microscopic analysis of the different fixed cell suspensions after labelling of the cells with a rabbit peroxidase conjugate showed that prefixation of the sample with glutaraldehyde was optimal for immunoelectron microscopical studies since this concentration preserved both the antigenicity of antigens as well as the ultrastructure of the cells under study Prolonged fixation periods affected antibody binding However molecules denatured at a

analyze the antigens on a Moloney lymphoma LSTRA using hyperimmune sarcoma regressor sera alphaMo as a primary reagent We also use heterologous p30 and gp70 sera for a direct analysis of virion protein antigens on the LSTRA surface Using radiolabeled assays we demonstrate that LSTRA tumor antigens detected by these sera are all Moloney viral antigens approximately of these antigenic determinants are expressed on the intact virus and the other determinants are revealed by detergent lysis of the virus The major viral antigens expressed on the LSTRA cell surface are viral env gene products whereas gag gene products are only sparsely represented We conclude that alphaMo sera detect almost exclusively viral antigens on LSTRA cells and these antigens are almost exclusively virion

previously demonstrated that in vitro cell lines of mouse thymic lymphomas express surface receptors specific for the retrovirus that induced them This study extends these observations to an analysis of cells in the preleukemic and leukemic phases of spontaneous AKR thymic lymphomagenesis AKR mice regularly begin expressing retroviruses as assayed on NIH fibroblasts by the XC plaque assay in several tissues early in life thymic lymphocytes also express these viruses but are not autonomously transformed Later thymic lymphomas emerge which are capable of metastasizing in the host of origin or transplanting leukemias into syngeneic hosts Just prior to the appearance of thymic lymphomas these mice also begin producing xenotropic retroviruses as assayed in xenogeneic For example mink fibroblasts and concomitant with the appearance of the leukemias is the appearance of recombinant retroviruses which cause mink fibroblast foci MCF these viruses express elements of both and virus envelopes and viral gene products in their cores Spontaneous AKR leukemias also produce other retroviruses which do not cause XC plaques or mink fibroblast foci these are called SL viruses The subject of this study was to test whether in vivo thymocytes in the preleukemic and leukemic periods also bear receptors specific for recombinant MCF and SL AKR retroviruses We demonstrated that each spontaneous thymic lymphoma does bear receptors that bind viruses produced by the lymphomas and to a high degree and that bind AKR retroviruses less well Thymic lymphocytes predominating in the preleukemic period do not express detectable levels of receptors for either of the viruses In some mice cells with cells only the cells are capable of transplanting leukemia to syngeneic hosts We conclude that the presence of specific cell surface receptors for lymphoma and recombinant AKR retroviruses is a marker for leukemia in these hosts View details for Web of Science ID A1979GV91300007

involvement of the spleen Although the initial mouse with this disease had B lymphocytes per mm3 in the peripheral blood and closely resembled a human chronic lymphocytic leukemia patient the studies described suggest that this murine B cell neoplasm is a lymphoma with a striking predilection for splenic involvement The other organs including the bone marrow as well as the peripheral blood

McGrath DECLEVE Lieberman KAPLAN Weissman 1978 28 3 Abstract We have developed a system for analysis of murine leukemic virus MuLV receptors on the surface of thymic lymphoma cells utilizing the cell sorter The binding of fluoresceinated or rhodaminated MuLV to target cells showed saturation kinetics and was blocked by homologous MuLV and bound MuLV had a polypeptide profile identical to that of input MuLV Thymic lymphomas bound specifically the MuLV which induced them whereas only to 2 of normal thymocytes showed equivalent MuLV binding Simultaneous binding of excess fluoresceinated RadLV and rhodaminated AKR virus to radiation leukemia or spontaneous AKR thymic lymphomas demonstrated that even in the presence of both viruses the cells bound preferentially the inducing MuLV Examination of the endogenous viruses showed that radiation leukemia thymic lymphomas bind only radiation leukemia virus and not or xenofibrotropic MuLV Thus virus binding in this system involves only leukemogenic isolates of these retroviruses and implies a central role of this interaction in the processes of leukemic transformation View details for Web of Science ID A1978FY67900017 View details

cell lines induced by this class of virus but were detectable in much lower concentrations if at all in several leukemias plasmacytomas and normal thymocytes or spleen cells By specific comparison Moloney leukemia virus binds to a lymphoma induced by but not to a thymic lymphoma induced by Gross leukemia virus and binds to an AKR lymphoma but not to the lymphoma The material which binds to these membrane sites is input virus rather than a contaminant which copurifies with virus Autoradiographic analysis demonstrates that a high proportion of cells possess binding sites whereas only a rare cell in the thymus binds murine leukemia virus to the same degree We raise and discuss the hypothesis that each T lymphoma induced by thymotropic leukemia viruses may represent the clonal

Strain mice were inoculated with radiation leukemia virus at different concentrations and tissues were removed at defined intervals Sequential sections were analyzed for cytoplasmic antigen expression for morphological evidence of neoplastic transformation and for alkaline phosphatase activity The first detectable sign of MuLV infection was the focal appearance of cytoplasmic viral antigens in cells of the outer thymic cortex followed by coalescence of such foci and several weeks later by the appearance of morphologically transformed and alkaline cells again often focally distributed in the outer thymic cortex These observations strongly suggest that the large mitotically active cells of the outer thymic cortex are the principal source of target cells for both productive infection and

electrophoresis Gel scans from the leukemia viruses are similar each showing six distinct major protein bands on stained gels The mammary tumor virus proteins by this analysis are not similar to those of the leukemia viruses Enzymatic iodination of intact virion preparations led to the solitary labeling of one of the major proteins of each protein of the leukemia viruses and the protein of the mammary tumor virus These are tentatively positioned as surface moieties in the virions Disruption of each virus with a nonionic nonionic detergent before enzymatic iodination led to the labeling of the remaining stainable bands The four lower molecular weight bands of the leukemia viruses are tentatively positioned as internal components View details for Web of Science ID A1973O525600010 View

requirement for T cells in expression of B cell memory Evidence using immunoglobulin allotype and mouse alloantigen theta markers with congenic mice journal of experimental medicine Mitchell Chan Noble Weissman MISHELL Herzenberg A 1972 135 2 Abstract Using sera and AKR anti thetaC3H sera a requirement for two cell types has been demonstrated in the adoptive secondary response of mice to heterologous erythrocytes The cell types have been designated B cells precursors of cells PFC and T cells cells not providing precursors of detectable PFC The in vivo indirect PFC response of spleen cells from primed mice is markedly reduced by in vitro treatment of the cells with a mixture of serum and guinea pig serum Anti theta GPS This B cell response is fully restored to control levels by thymus cells from normal mice which do not themselves provide precursors of indirect PFC Thus memory is carried by the B cell lineage but the expression of this memory is dependent on the presence of a cell population which is sensitive to Anti theta GPS and which is replaced functionally by unprimed T cells When assayed for T cell activity thoracic duct cells from specifically primed mice are better than cells from nonspecifically primed mice in restoring the B cell response of spleen cells from immunized mice Moreover the T cell activity of a reconstitutive cell population from primed mice is reduced by incubation with Anti theta GPS We conclude that memory to heterologous erythrocyte antigens is carried by the T cell lineage as well as the B cell lineage even though unprimed T cells are sufficient for expression of B cell memory View details for PubMedID 4110524 IMMUNOTHERAPY AND IMMUNODIAGNOSIS OF METASTATIC NEOPLASMS PROSPECTS AND PROGRESS Frontiers of Radiation Therapy

MEDICINE Weissman 1967 126 2 Abstract THE PRECEDING STUDIES HAVE ESTABLISHED THE FOLLOWING POINTS Intrathymic labeling of thymic lymphocytes provides an adequate marker system to detect the migration of thymus cells to peripheral lymphoid sites In the newborn this comprises a major portion of the total lymphocyte population in lymph nodes and spleen In the adult this migration is limited to specific portions of lymph nodes and spleen those portions which serve the recirculating pool of small lymphocytes Kinetic studies of labeling within the adult thymus indicate that large cells give rise to medium and small cells which then migrate to the specific sites noted above In the newborn the kinetic pattern is similar to that of adults with the single distinction that large cells also migrate accelerating the tempo of migration in these hosts The fate and function of thymus cell migrants has not yet been determined View details for Web of Science ID A19679726600008 View details for
