integrity of animal tissues We study multiple different organs trying to identify common principles and we extend these investigations to cancer and injury repair In most organs different cell types are generated by stem cells cells that also make copies of themselves and thereby maintain the tissue An optimal balance between the number of stem and differentiated cells is essential for the proper function of the organs signals are important to maintain this balance in a manner and these signals are key to understanding the regulation of growth A common theme linking our work together are Wnt signals Work from many laboratories including our own has shown that Wnt proteins are essential for the control over stem cells How this is achieved is far from clear and is the subject of studies in the lab both in vivo and in cell culture In vivo a particular question we address is how physiological changes such as those occurring during hormonal stimuli injury or programmed tissue degeneration have an impact on the signals and on stem cell our most recent work we have designed cell fate tracking experiments to study stem cells in vivo We identified stem cells by their expression of Axin2 a common Wnt target gene and generated a mouse strain with the CreERT2 recombination signal inserted into the Axin2 locus By clonal labeling we showed that single stem cells differentiate into different cell types of the tissues of interest Unexpectedly in the liver we found that hepatocytes that reside in the pericentral domain of the liver demonstrate stem cell behavior Although these cells are functional hepatocytes they are diploid and thus differ from the mostly polyploid mature hepatocyte population They are active in homeostatic cell replacement Adjacent central vein endothelial cells provide the essential source of Wnt signals for the hepatocyte stem cells and thereby constitute the liver stem cell niche Courses Cell and Developmental BiologyHUMBIO 3A Win Cells and Signaling in

generation of multiple cell fates cellular diversity and their patterned spatial arrangement spatial form Wnt proteins operate as primordial signals By virtue of their nature and their capacity to activate both and intracellular signaling cascades Wnts can polarize cells at their site of contact orienting the axis of cell division while simultaneously programming daughter cells to adopt diverging fates in a spatially stereotyped way By coupling cell fate to position Wnt signals were pivotal in constructing the metazoan body by generating cellular diversity and spatial form View

the uninjured liver has remained an open question By lineage tracing using the gene Axin2 in mice we identify a population of proliferating and cells adjacent to the central vein in the liver lobule These pericentral cells express the early liver progenitor marker Tbx3 are diploid and thereby differ from mature hepatocytes which are mostly polyploid The descendants of pericentral cells differentiate into polyploid hepatocytes and can replace all hepatocytes along the liver lobule during homeostatic renewal Adjacent central vein endothelial cells provide Wnt signals that maintain the pericentral cells thereby constituting the niche Thus we identify a cell population in the liver that subserves homeostatic hepatocyte renewal characterize its anatomical niche and identify molecular signals that regulate its activity View details for DOI View details for Web of Science ID 000359386900023 View details for PubMedID 26245375 View details for PubMedCentralID PMC4589224 An integral

Interfollicular Epidermal Stem Cells via Autocrine Wnt Signaling SCIENCE Lim Tan Koh Chau Yan Kuo van Amerongen Klein Nusse 2013 342 6163 Abstract The skin is a classical example of a tissue maintained by stem cells However the identity of the stem cells that maintain the interfollicular epidermis and the source of the signals that control their activity remain unclear Using mouse lineage tracing and quantitative clonal analyses we showed that the Wnt target gene Axin2 marks interfollicular epidermal stem cells These cells constitute the majority of the basal epidermal layer compete neutrally and require signaling to proliferate The same cells contribute robustly to wound healing with no requirement for a quiescent stem cell subpopulation By means of RNA in situ hybridization in

Developmental signals such as Wnts are often presented to cells in an oriented manner To examine the consequences of local Wnt signaling we immobilized Wnt proteins on beads and introduced them to embryonic stem cells in culture At the level the induced asymmetric distribution of signaling components oriented the plane of mitotic division and directed asymmetric inheritance of centrosomes Before cytokinesis was completed the daughter cell expressed high levels of nuclear and pluripotency genes whereas the distal daughter cell acquired hallmarks of differentiation We suggest that a spatially restricted Wnt signal induces an oriented cell division that generates distinct cell fates at predictable positions relative to the Wnt source View details for DOI View details for Web of

stem cells have the ability to and to generate specialized cells is dependent on extrinsic niche factors but few of those signals have been identified In addition stem cells tend to differentiate in the absence of the proper signals and are therefore difficult to maintain in cell culture The mammary gland provides an excellent system to study signals because the organ develops postnatally arises from stem cells and is readily generated from transplanted cells We show here that adult mammary glands contain a cell population that is enriched for stem cells In addition stem cells mutant for the regulator Axin2 and therefore sensitized to Wnt signals have a competitive advantage in mammary gland reconstitution assays In cell culture experiments exposure to purified Wnt protein clonally expands mammary stem cells for many generations and maintains their ability to generate functional glands in transplantation assays We conclude that Wnt proteins serve as signals acting directly on mammary stem cells View details for DOI View details for Web of Science ID 000278840700017 View details for PubMedID 20569694 Purified Wnt5a protein activates or inhibits signaling depending on receptor context PLOS BIOLOGY Mikels Nusse 2006 4 4 Abstract The Wnts comprise a large class of secreted proteins that control essential developmental processes such as embryonic patterning cell growth migration and differentiation In the most canonical Wnt signaling pathway Wnt binding to Frizzled receptors induces protein stabilization and entry into the nucleus where it complexes with enhancer factor transcription factors to affect the transcription of target genes In addition to the canonical pathway evidence for several other Wnt signaling pathways has accumulated in particular for Wnt5a which has therefore been classified as a noncanonical Wnt family member To study the alternative mechanisms by which Wnt proteins signal we purified the Wnt5a protein to homogeneity We find that purified Wnt5a inhibits Wnt3a canonical Wnt signaling in a manner not by influencing levels but by downregulating reporter gene expression The Wnt5a signal is mediated by the orphan tyrosine kinase Ror2 is pertussis toxin insensitive and does not influence cellular calcium levels We show that in addition to its inhibitory function Wnt5a can also activate signaling in the presence of the appropriate Frizzled receptor Frizzled 4 Thus this study shows for the first time that a single Wnt ligand can initiate discrete signaling pathways through the activation of two distinct receptors Based on these and additional observations we propose a model wherein receptor context dictates Wnt signaling output In this model signaling by different Wnt family members is not intrinsically regulated by the Wnt proteins themselves but by receptor availability View details for DOI View details for Web of Science ID 000237066500011 View details for PubMedID 16602827 Wnt proteins are and can act as stem cell growth factors NATURE Willert BROWN Danenberg Duncan Weissman Reya Yates Nusse 2003 423 6938 Abstract Wnt signalling is involved in numerous events in animal development including the proliferation of stem cells and the specification of the neural crest Wnt proteins are potentially important reagents in expanding specific cell types but in contrast to other developmental signalling molecules such as hedgehog proteins and the bone morphogenetic proteins Wnt proteins have never been isolated in an active form Although Wnt proteins are secreted from cells secretion is usually inefficient and previous attempts to characterize Wnt proteins have been hampered by their high degree of insolubility Here we have isolated active Wnt molecules including the product of the mouse Wnt3a gene By mass spectrometry we found the proteins to be palmitoylated on a conserved cysteine Enzymatic removal of the palmitate or and natural mutations of the modified cysteine result in loss of activity and indicate that the lipid is important for signalling The purified Wnt3a protein induces of haematopoietic stem cells signifying its potential use in tissue engineering View details

Logan Rysztak Breault Koo Clevers Nusse Val Hammer 2019 Abstract Spatiotemporal control of Wnt signaling is essential for the development and homeostasis of many tissues The transmembrane E3 ubiquitin ligases ZNRF3 zinc and ring finger 3 and RNF43 ring finger protein 43 antagonize Wnt signaling by promoting degradation of frizzled receptors ZNRF3 and RNF43 are frequently inactivated in human cancer but the molecular and therapeutic implications remain unclear Here we demonstrate that loss of ZNRF3 but not RNF43 results in adrenal hyperplasia that depends on Wnt ligand secretion Furthermore we discovered a signaling gradient in the adrenal cortex that is disrupted upon loss of ZNRF3 Unlike models which induce high activation and expansion of the peripheral cortex ZNRF3 loss triggers activation of signaling that drives proliferative expansion of only the histologically and functionally distinct inner cortex Genetically reducing dosage significantly reverses the phenotype Thus homeostatic maintenance of the adrenal cortex is dependent on varying levels of activation which is regulated by ZNRF3 View details for PubMedID 30692207 signaling regulates ependymal cell development and adult homeostasis Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America Xing Anbarchian Tsai Plant Nusse 2018 Abstract In the adult mouse spinal cord the ependymal cell population that surrounds the central canal is thought to be a promising source of quiescent stem cells to treat spinal cord injury Relatively little is known about the cellular origin of ependymal cells during spinal cord development or the molecular mechanisms that regulate ependymal cells during adult homeostasis Using genetic lineage tracing based on the Wnt target gene Axin2 we have characterized cells during spinal cord development Our results revealed that progenitor cells are restricted to the dorsal midline throughout spinal cord development which gives rise to dorsal ependymal cells in a spatially restricted pattern This is contrary to previous reports that suggested an exclusively ventral origin of ependymal cells suggesting that ependymal cells may retain positional identities in relation to their neural progenitors Our results further demonstrated that in the postnatal and adult spinal cord all ependymal cells express the signaling target gene Axin2 as well as Wnt ligands Genetic elimination of or inhibition of Wnt secretion in ependymal cells in vivo both resulted in impaired proliferation indicating that signaling promotes ependymal cell proliferation These results demonstrate the continued importance of signaling for both ependymal cell formation and regulation By uncovering the molecular signals underlying the formation and regulation of spinal cord ependymal cells our findings thus enable further targeting and manipulation of this promising source of quiescent stem cells for therapeutic interventions View details for

constant regeneration of stomach epithelium is driven by stem cells but the mechanism that regulates their turnover is not well understood We have recently found that the gastric pathogen Helicobacter pylori can activate gastric stem cells and increase epithelial turnover while Wnt signalling is known to be important for stem cell identity and epithelial regeneration in several tissues Here we find that antral Wnt signalling marked by the classic Wnt target gene Axin2 is limited to the base and lower isthmus of gastric glands where the stem cells reside Axin2 is expressed by cells as well as adjacent highly proliferative cells that are able to repopulate entire glands including the base upon depletion of the population Expression of both Axin2 and Lgr5 requires 3 produced by gastric myofibroblasts proximal to the stem cell compartment Exogenous administration expands and accelerates proliferation of but not cells Consistent with these observations pylori infection increases stromal 3 expression and expands the cell pool to cause hyperproliferation and gland hyperplasia The ability of stromal niche cells to control and adapt epithelial stem cell dynamics constitutes a sophisticated mechanism that orchestrates epithelial regeneration and maintenance of tissue integrity View details for PubMedID 28813421 Paracrine signaling mediates proliferation of undifferentiated

Transition Journal of the American Heart Association Mizutani Wu Nusse 2016 5 3 Abstract The adult mammalian heart responds to cardiac injury by formation of persistent fibrotic scar that eventually leads to heart failure In contrast the neonatal mammalian heart reacts to injury by the development of transient fibrotic tissue that is eventually replaced by regenerated cardiomyocytes How fibrosis occurs in the neonatal mammalian heart remains unknown To start elucidating the molecular underpinnings of neonatal cardiac fibrosis we investigated Wnt signaling in the neonatal heart after expression of the Wnt target gene Axin2 as an indicator of signaling activation we discovered that epicardial cells in the ventricles are responsive to Wnt in the uninjured neonatal heart studies of these epicardial cells showed that they undergo transition and infiltrate into the subepicardial space and exhibit fibroblast phenotypes after injury In addition we showed to adult ischemic cryoinjury results in activation of Wnt signaling in cardiac fibroblasts near injured areas Furthermore through in situ hybridization of all 19 Wnt ligands in injured neonatal hearts we observed upregulation of Wnt ligands Wnt2b Wnt5a and Wnt9a that had not been implicated in the adult cardiac injury results demonstrate that cryoinjury in neonatal heart leads to the formation of fibrotic tissue that involves epicardial cells undergoing transition to give rise to fibroblasts and activation of Wnt signaling in resident cardiac fibroblasts View details for DOI View details for PubMedID 27068625 Paracrine

Abstract Spermatogonial stem cells SSCs fuel the production of male germ cells but the mechanisms behind SSC proliferation and differentiation are still poorly understood Using the Wnt target gene Axin2 and genetic experiments we found that undifferentiated spermatogonia comprising SSCs and transit amplifying progenitor cells respond to signals Genetic elimination of indicates that signaling promotes the proliferation of these cells Signaling is likely initiated by Wnt6 which is uniquely expressed by neighboring Sertoli cells the only somatic cells in the seminiferous tubule that support germ cells and act as a niche for SSCs Therefore unlike other stem cell systems where signaling is implicated in the Wnt pathway in the testis specifically contributes to the proliferation of SSCs and

the United States of America Lim Tan Yu Lim Nusse 2016 113 11 Abstract How stem cells maintain their identity and potency as tissues change during growth is not well understood In mammalian hair it is unclear how hair follicle stem cells can enter an extended period of quiescence during the resting phase but retain stem cell potential and be subsequently activated for growth Here we use lineage tracing and gene expression mapping to show that the Wnt target gene Axin2 is constantly expressed throughout the hair cycle quiescent phase in outer bulge stem cells that produce their own Wnt signals Ablating Wnt signaling in the bulge cells causes them to lose their stem cell potency to contribute to hair growth and undergo premature differentiation instead Bulge cells express secreted Wnt inhibitors including Dickkopf Dkk and secreted protein 1 Sfrp1 However the Dickkopf 3 Dkk3 protein becomes localized to the inner bulge that contains differentiated cells We find that Axin2 expression remains confined to the outer bulge whereas Dkk3 continues to be localized to the inner bulge during the hair cycle growth phase Our data suggest that autocrine Wnt signaling in the outer bulge maintains stem cell potency throughout hair cycle quiescence and growth whereas paracrine Wnt inhibition of inner bulge cells reinforces differentiation View details for PubMedID 26903625 Cells

Axin2 is a direct transcriptional target of Recent studies have shown that cells have cell properties in a variety of mouse tissues Here we genetically labeled cells at various time points and tracked their cellular behavior at different developmental and mature stages We found that prostatic cells mainly express luminal epithelial cell markers and are able to expand luminal cell lineages during prostatic development and maturation They can also survive androgen withdrawal and regenerate prostatic luminal epithelial cells following androgen replacement Deletion of or expression of stabilized in these cells results in abnormal development or oncogenic transformation respectively Our study uncovers a critical role of cells in prostatic development and regeneration and that dysregulation of

Since the discovery of neural stem cells in the mammalian brain there has been significant interest in understanding their contribution to tissue homeostasis at both the cellular and molecular level signaling is crucial for development of the central nervous system and has been implicated in stem cell maintenance in multiple tissues Based on this we hypothesized that the Wnt pathway likely controls neural stem cell maintenance and differentiation along the entire developmental continuum To test this we performed lineage tracing experiments using the recently developed Cre at Axin2 mouse strain to follow the developmental fate of cells in both the embryonic and postnatal mouse brain From as early as embryonic day onwards Axin2 cells can give rise to spatially and functionally restricted populations of adult neural stem cells in the subventricular zone Similarly progeny from Axin2 cells labeled from contribute to both the subventricular zone and the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus Labeling in the postnatal brain in turn demonstrates the persistence of stem cells in both of these sites These results demonstrate the continued importance of signaling for neural stem and progenitor cell formation and function throughout developmental time View details for DOI View details for PubMedID 23589866 View details for PubMedCentralID PMC3645553 Paracrine Wnt signaling

17 Abstract Wnt signaling in mouse mammary development and tumorigenesis has been heavily studied and characterized but its role in human breast cancer remains elusive Although Wnt inhibitors are in early clinical development it is unclear whether they will be of therapeutic benefit to breast cancer patients and subsequently to which ones To address this we generated a panel of Wnt reporting human breast cancer cell lines and identified a previously unrecognized enrichment for the ability to respond to Wnt in the basal B or subtype which has a poor prognosis and no available targeted therapies By Wnt3A expressing human mammary fibroblasts with human breast cancer cell lines into mouse mammary fat pads we showed that elevated paracrine Wnt signaling was correlated with accelerated tumor growth Using this heterotypic system and a dual lentiviral reporter system that enables simultaneous measurement of both cells and bulk tumor cells we analyzed the outcome of elevated Wnt signaling in xenograft PDX models Interestingly the PDX models exhibited responses not observed in the cell lines analyzed Exogenous WNT3A promoted tumor growth in one human epidermal growth factor receptor PDX line but inhibited growth in a second PDX line obtained from a patient with breast cancer Tumor suppression was associated with squamous differentiation in the latter Thus our work suggests that paracrine Wnt signaling can either fuel or repress the growth of human breast cancers depending on yet to be determined aspects of the molecular pathways they express View details for

cochlear sensory hair cells and nonsensory supporting cells In the postnatal cochlea the sensory epithelium is terminally differentiated whereas tympanic border cells TBCs beneath the sensory epithelium are proliferative The functions of TBCs are poorly characterized Using an Axin2 lacZ Wnt reporter mouse we found transient but robust Wnt signaling and proliferation in TBCs during the first 3 postnatal weeks when the number of TBCs decreases In vivo lineage tracing shows that a subset of hair cells and supporting cells is derived postnatally from TBCs In cochlear explants Wnt agonists stimulated the proliferation of TBCs whereas Wnt inhibitors suppressed it In addition purified Axin2 lacZ cells were clonogenic and in culture in a manner and were able to differentiate into

Signaling in Skin Development Homeostasis and Disease COLD SPRING HARBOR PERSPECTIVES IN BIOLOGY Lim Nusse 2013 5 2 Abstract The skin and its appendages constitute the largest organ of the body Its stratified epithelia offer protection from environmental stresses such as dehydration irradiation mechanical trauma and pathogenic infection whereas its appendages like hair and sebaceous glands help regulate body temperature as well as influence animal interaction and social behavior through camouflage and sexual signaling To respond to and function effectively in a dynamic external environment the skin and its appendages possess a remarkable ability to regenerate in a carefully controlled fashion When this finely tuned homeostatic process is disrupted skin diseases such as cancers may result At present the molecular signals that orchestrate cell proliferation differentiation and patterning in the skin remain incompletely understood It is increasingly apparent that many morphogenetic pathways with key roles in development are also important in regulating skin biology Of these Wnt signaling has emerged as the dominant pathway controlling the patterning of skin and influencing the decisions of embryonic and adult stem cells to adopt the various cell lineages of the skin and its appendages as well as subsequently controlling the function of differentiated skin

relevant cells Here we show using Wnt reporter hESC lines that the cells are heterogeneous with respect to endogenous Wnt signalling activity Moreover the level of Wnt signalling activity in individual cells correlates with differences in clonogenic potential and differentiation propensity The addition of Wnt protein or conversely a Wnt inhibitor IWP2 reduces heterogeneity allowing stable expansion of Wnt high or Wnt low hESC populations respectively On differentiation the Wnt high hESCs predominantly form endodermal and cardiac cells whereas the Wnt low hESCs generate primarily neuroectodermal cells Thus heterogeneity with respect to endogenous Wnt signalling underlies much of the inefficiency in directing hESCs towards specific cell types The relatively uniform differentiation potential of the Wnt high and Wnt low hESCs leads to faster and more efficient derivation of targeted cell types from these populations View details for DOI View details for Web of

proteins comprise a major family of signaling molecules that orchestrate and influence a myriad of cell biological and developmental processes Although our understanding of the role of Wnt signaling

biochemical characterization of Wnt proteins many mysteries remain unsolved In contrast to other developmental signaling molecules such as fibroblast growth factors FGF transforming growth factors TGFβ and Sonic hedgehog Shh Wnt proteins have not conformed to many standard methods of protein production such as bacterial overexpression and analysis such as binding assays The reasons for their recalcitrant nature are likely a consequence of the complex set of posttranslational modifications involving several highly specialized and poorly characterized processing enzymes With the recent

Abstract Embryonic development is controlled by a small set of signal transduction pathways with vastly different phenotypic outcomes depending on the time and place of their recruitment How the same molecular machinery can elicit such specific and distinct responses remains one of the outstanding questions in developmental biology Part of the answer may lie in the high inherent genetic complexity of these signaling cascades as observed for the The mammalian genome encodes multiple Wnt proteins and receptors each of which show dynamic and tightly controlled expression patterns in the embryo Yet how these components interact in the context of the whole organism remains unknown Here we report the generation of a novel inducible transgenic mouse model that allows spatiotemporal control over the expression of Wnt5a a protein implicated in many developmental processes and multiple responses We show that ectopic Wnt5a expression from onwards results in a variety of developmental defects including loss of hair follicles and reduced bone formation in the skull Moreover we find that Wnt5a can have dual signaling activities during mouse embryonic development Specifically Wnt5a is capable of both inducing and repressing signaling in vivo depending on the time and site of expression and the receptors expressed by receiving cells These experiments show for the first time that a single mammalian Wnt protein can have multiple signaling activities in vivo thereby furthering our understanding of how signaling specificity is achieved in a complex developmental context View details for

management is complicated by morphological heterogeneity inadequate molecular markers and limited therapeutic options Receptor tyrosine kinases RTKs have been shown to play important roles in cancer both as therapeutic targets and as prognostic biomarkers An initial screen of gene expression data for 48 RTKs in 148 sarcomas showed that ROR2 was expressed in a subset of leiomyosarcoma LMS gastrointestinal stromal tumour GIST and fibromatosis DTF This was further confirmed by immunohistochemistry IHC on 573 tissue samples from 59 sarcoma tumour types Here we provide evidence that ROR2 expression plays a role in the invasive abilities of LMS and GIST cells in vitro We also show that knockdown of ROR2 significantly reduces tumour mass in vivo using a xenotransplantation model of LMS Lastly we show that ROR2 expression as measured by IHC predicts poor clinical outcome in patients with LMS and GIST although it was not independent of other features in a multivariate analysis and that ROR2 expression is maintained between primary tumours and their metastases Together these results show that ROR2 is a useful prognostic indicator in the clinical management of these sarcomas and

hair cell markers myo7a calretinin parvalbumin myo6 and structures expressing and espin In comparison with other supporting cells Lgr5 cells were enriched precursors to myo7a cells most of which formed without mitotic division Treatment with Wnt agonists increased proliferation and capacity Conversely inhibitors of Wnt signaling suppressed proliferation without compromising the myo7a cells formed by direct differentiation In vivo lineage tracing supported the idea that Lgr5 cells give rise to myo7a hair cells in the neonatal Lgr5 cochlea In addition overexpression of initiated proliferation and led to transient expansion of Lgr5 cells within the cochlear sensory epithelium These results suggest that Lgr5 marks sensory precursors and that Wnt signaling can promote their

EpiSCs ref 1 In the naive state of ESCs the genome has an unusual open conformation and possesses a minimum of repressive epigenetic marks In contrast EpiSCs have activated the epigenetic machinery that supports differentiation towards the embryonic cell types The transition from naive to primed pluripotency therefore represents a pivotal event in cellular differentiation But the signals that control this fundamental differentiation step remain unclear We show here that paracrine and autocrine Wnt signals are essential factors for ESCs and are required to inhibit their differentiation into EpiSCs Moreover we find that Wnt proteins in combination with the cytokine LIF are sufficient to support ESC in the absence of any undefined factors and support the derivation of new ESC lines

Wnt factors could be used to stimulate bone healing We gained insights into the mechanism by which Wnt signaling regulates adult bone repair through the use of the mouse strain Axin2 in which the cellular response to Wnt is increased We found that bone healing after injury is accelerated in Axin2 mice a consequence of more robust proliferation and earlier differentiation of skeletal stem and progenitor cells In parallel we devised a biochemical strategy to increase the duration and strength of Wnt signaling at the sites of skeletal injury Purified Wnt3a was packaged in liposomal vesicles and delivered to skeletal defects where it stimulated the proliferation of skeletal progenitor cells and accelerated their differentiation into osteoblasts cells responsible for bone growth The end result was faster bone regeneration Because Wnt signaling is conserved in mammalian tissue repair this approach may have widespread applications in regenerative medicine View details for DOI View

pattern and undergo coordinated differentiation The development of the vertebrate limb is an important paradigm for understanding these processes The skeletal and connective tissues of the developing limb all derive from a population of multipotent progenitor cells located in its distal tip During limb outgrowth these progenitors segregate into a chondrogenic lineage located in the center of the limb bud and soft connective tissue lineages located in its periphery We report that the interplay of two families of signaling proteins fibroblast growth factors FGFs and Wnts coordinate the growth of the multipotent progenitor cells with their simultaneous segregation into these lineages FGF and Wnt signals act together to synergistically promote proliferation while maintaining the cells in an undifferentiated multipotent state but act separately to determine cell lineage specification Withdrawal of both signals results in cell cycle withdrawal and chondrogenic differentiation Continued exposure to Wnt however maintains proliferation and the cells towards the soft connective tissue lineages We have identified target genes that are synergistically regulated by Wnts and FGFs and show how these factors actively suppress differentiation and promote growth Finally we show how the spatial restriction of Wnt and FGF signals to the limb ectoderm and to a specialized region of it the apical ectodermal ridge controls the distribution of cell behaviors within the growing limb and guides the proper spatial organization of the differentiating tissues View details for DOI View details

Helms J Nusse 2008 3 8 Abstract Wnt signals exercise strong and regenerative effects of considerable therapeutic value There are however no specific Wnt agonists and no method for in vivo delivery of purified Wnt proteins Wnts contain lipid adducts that are required for activity and we exploited this lipophilicity by packaging purified Wnt3a protein into lipid vesicles Rather than being encapsulated Wnts are tethered to the liposomal surface where they enhance and sustain Wnt signaling in vitro Molecules that effectively antagonize soluble Wnt3a protein but are ineffective against the Wnt3a signal presented by a cell in a paracrine or autocrine manner are also unable to block liposomal Wnt3a activity suggesting that liposomal packaging mimics the biological state of active Wnts

succumb to persistent pathogenic infections Understanding of this pathogenesis is limited but it appears that host factors induced by microbes can have a direct cost to the host organism Mutations in wntD cause susceptibility to Listeria monocytogenes infection apparently through the derepression of target genes some of which are deleterious to survival Here we use gene expression profiling to identify genes that may mediate the observed susceptibility of wntD mutants to lethal infection These genes include the TNF family member eiger and the novel immunity gene edin elevated during infection synonym CG32185 both of which are more strongly induced by infection of wntD mutants compared to controls edin is also expressed more highly during infection of flies with Salmonella typhimurium than with a less pathogenic mutant strain and its expression is regulated in part by the Imd pathway Furthermore overexpression of edin can induce lethality while loss of function in edin renders flies more susceptible to Listeria infection These results are consistent with a model in which the regulation of host factors including edin must be tightly controlled to avoid the

Porcupine and have been identified as being required in cells for the processing and secretion of many Wnt proteins Interestingly in this study we find that WntD a recently characterized Drosophila Wnt family member does not require Porcupine or for its secretion or signaling activity Because Porcupine is involved in lipid modification of Wnt proteins we used a novel labeling method and mass

cells How Fz and Vang communicate polarity information between neighboring cells is poorly understood The atypical cadherin Flamingo Fmi is implicated in this process yet whether Fmi acts permissively

cells are influenced by signals from their environment constituting a niche It is postulated that stem cells compete for local growth factors in the niche thereby maintaining a balance between the numbers of and differentiated cells A critical aspect of the niche model for stem cell regulation is that the availability of factors is limited and that stem cells compete for these factors Fig 1 Consequently the range and concentrations of the niche factors are of critical importance Now that some of the few factors have become identified aspects of the niche models can be tested experimentally In this chapter we address mechanisms of signal regulation that take place at the level of cells constituting a niche for stem cells We emphasize the biochemical properties and posttranslational modifications of the signals all in the context of Wnt signaling We propose that these modifications control the range of Wnt signaling and have critical roles in establishing niches

a highly conserved pattern of Wnt responsiveness in the developing mouse face that later corresponded to derivatives of the frontonasal and maxillary prominences We explored the consequences of disrupting Wnt signaling first using a genetic approach Mice carrying compound null mutations in the nuclear mediators Lef1 and Tcf4 exhibited radically altered facial features that culminated in a hyperteloric appearance and a foreshortened midface We also used a biochemical approach to perturb Wnt signaling and found that in utero delivery of a Wnt antagonist Dkk1 produced similar midfacial malformations We tested the hypothesis that Wnt signaling is an evolutionarily conserved mechanism controlling facial morphogenesis by determining the pattern of Wnt responsiveness in avian faces and then by evaluating the consequences of Wnt inhibition in the chick face Collectively these data elucidate a new role for Wnt signaling in regional specification of the vertebrate face and suggest

Wnt signaling stimulates islet beta cell proliferation The addition of purified Wnt3a protein to cultured beta cells or islets promoted expression of Pitx2 a direct target of Wnt signaling and Cyclin

and it regulates cell fate decisions through Armadillo Arm by acting as a receptor for the Wnt protein Wingless Wg With the exception of dishevelled dsh the genes functioning in these two pathways are distinct We have taken a genetic approach based on a series of new and existing fz alleles for identifying individual amino acids required for PCP or Arm signaling For each allele we have attempted to quantify the strength of signaling by phenotypic measurements For PCP signaling the defect was measured by counting the number of cells secreting multiple hairs in the wing We then examined each allele for its ability to participate in Arm signaling by the rescue of fz mutant embryos with maternally provided fz function For both PCP and Arm signaling we observed a broad range of phenotypes but for every allele there is a strong correlation between its phenotypic strength in each pathway Therefore even though the PCP and Arm signaling pathways are genetically distinct the set of fz alleles affected both pathways to a similar extent This suggests that fz controls these two different signaling activities by a common mechanism In addition this screen yielded a set of missense

Overexpression of activated expands the pool of HSCs in cultures by both phenotype and function Furthermore HSCs in their normal microenvironment activate a reporter which indicates that HCSs respond

receptors on the cell surface In the genome of Drosophila seven Wnt genes including wingless wg and five frizzled genes have been identified Relatively little is known about signaling and binding specificities of different Wnt and Frizzled proteins We have developed an assay to determine the strength of binding between Wnts and ligand binding domains of the Frizzled receptors We found a wide spectrum of binding affinities reflecting known genetic interactions Most Wnt proteins can bind to multiple Frizzleds and vice versa suggesting redundancy in vivo In an extension of these experiments we tested whether two different subdomains of the Wg protein would by themselves bind to Frizzled and generate a biological response Whereas these two separate domains are secreted from cells suggesting that they form independently folded parts of the protein they were only able to evoke a response when indicating that both are required for function In addition to the Frizzleds members of

ventral regions of the presumptive eye We provide evidence that wingless mediates both effects at least in part through repression of the basic protein Daughterless daughterless is required for high proneural gene expression and furrow progression Ectopic expression of wingless blocks Daughterless expression in the proneural clusters This repression and that of furrow progression can be mimicked by an activated form of armadillo and blocked by a dominant negative form of Placing daughterless under the control of a heterologous promoter blocks the ability of ectopic wingless to inhibit bristle formation and furrow progression hedgehog and decapentapleigic could not rescue the wingless furrow progression block indicating that wingless acts downstream of these genes In contrast Atonal and Scute which are thought to heterodimerize with Daughterless to promote furrow progression and bristle formation respectively can block ectopic wingless action These results are summarized in a model

performed genetic screens to isolate additional dsh alleles and we examined the potential role of protein phosphorylation by mutagenesis We identified two alleles with point mutations in the Dsh DEP domain that specifically disrupt planar polarity signaling When positioned in the structure of the DEP domain these mutations are located close to each other and to a previously identified planar polarity mutation In addition to the requirement for the DEP domain we found that a cluster of potential phosphorylation sites in a binding domain for the protein kinase is also essential for planar polarity signaling To identify regions of dsh that are necessary for Wg signaling we screened for mutations that modified a overexpression phenotype in the eye We recovered many alleles of the transgene containing missense mutations including mutations in the DIX domain and in the DEP domain the latter group mapping separately from the planar polarity mutations In addition several transgenes had mutations within a domain containing a consensus sequence for an protein We also recovered mutations in axin mapping at a region that may specifically interact with overexpressed Dsh

the fruit fly Drosophila four insulin genes are coexpressed in small clusters of cells cells IPCs in the brain Here we show that ablation of these IPCs causes developmental delay growth retardation and elevated carbohydrate levels in larval hemolymph All of the defects were reversed by ectopic expression of a Drosophila insulin transgene On the basis of these functional data and the observation that IPCs release insulin into the circulatory system we conclude that brain IPCs are the main systemic supply of insulin during larval growth We propose that IPCs and pancreatic islet beta cells are functionally analogous and may have evolved from a common ancestral neuron Interestingly the phenotype of flies lacking IPCs includes certain features of diabetes mellitus View details for Web of

DEVELOPMENTAL BIOLOGY Kozopas Nusse 2002 243 2 Abstract The direct flight muscles DFMs of Drosophila allow for the fine control of wing position necessary for flight In mutant flies certain DFMs are either missing or fail to attach to the correct epithelial sites Using a allele we show that activity is required only during pupation for correct DFM patterning is expressed in the epithelium of the wing hinge primordium during pupation This expression is in the vicinity of the developing DFMs as revealed by expression of the muscle founder gene dumbfounded in DFM precursors The observation that a gene necessary for embryonic founder cell function is expressed in the DFM precursors suggests that these cells may have a similar founder cell role Although the expression pattern of suggests that it could influence epithelial cells to differentiate into attachment sites for muscle the expression of stripe a transcription factor necessary for epithelial cells to adopt an attachment cell fate is unaltered in the mutant Ectopic expression of in the wing hinge during pupation can also create defects in muscle patterning without alterations in stripe expression We conclude that promotes the correct patterning of DFMs through a mechanism that is independent of the attachment site differentiation initiated by stripe View details for DOI View details for Web of Science ID 000174465500010

acquisition of neural fate by embryonic ectodermal cells is a fundamental step in the formation of the vertebrate nervous system Neural induction seems to involve signalling by fibroblast growth factors FGFs and attenuation of the activity of bone morphogenetic protein BMP But FGFs either alone or in combination with BMP antagonists are not sufficient to induce neural fate in prospective epidermal ectoderm of amniote embryos These findings suggest that additional signals are involved in the specification of neural fate Here we show that the state of Wnt signalling is a critical determinant of neural and epidermal fates in the chick embryo Continual Wnt signalling blocks the response of epiblast cells to FGF signals permitting the expression and signalling of BMP to direct an epidermal fate Conversely a lack of exposure of epiblast cells to Wnt signals permits FGFs to induce a neural fate View details for Web of Science ID 000168710000052 View details for PubMedID 11357137 naked cuticle targets dishevelled to antagonize Wnt signal transduction GENES DEVELOPMENT Rousset Mack J Wharton Axelrod Cadigan Fish Nusse Scott 2001 15 6 Abstract In Drosophila embryos the protein Naked cuticle Nkd limits the effects of the Wnt signal Wingless Wg during early segmentation nkd loss of function results in segment polarity defects and embryonic death but how nkd affects Wnt signaling is unknown Using ectopic expression we find that Nkd affects in a manner a transduction step between the Wnt signaling components Dishevelled Dsh and 3 kinase Zw3 Zw3 is essential for repressing Wg transcription in the absence of a Wg signal and the role of Wg is to relieve this inhibition Our analysis shows that in contrast to Zw3 Nkd acts when the Wg pathway is active to restrain signal transduction Yeast two hybrid and in vitro experiments indicate that Nkd directly binds to the region of Dsh Specially timed Nkd overexpression is capable of abolishing Dsh function in a distinct signaling pathway that controls polarity Our results suggest that Nkd acts directly through Dsh to limit Wg activity and thus determines how efficiently Wnt signals stabilize Armadillo Arm

for wingless MOLECULAR CELL Rulifson Wu Nusse 2000 6 1 Abstract The Frizzled Fz protein in Drosophila is a bifunctional receptor that acts through a GTPase pathway in planar polarity signaling and as a receptor for Wingless Wg using the canonical Wnt pathway We found that the domain CRD of Fz has an approximately lower affinity for Wg than the CRD of DFz2 a Wg receptor without polarity activity When the Fz CRD is replaced by the CRD of DFz2 the resulting chimeric protein gains Wg signaling activity yet also retains polarity signaling activity In contrast the reciprocal exchange of the Fz CRD onto DFz2 is not sufficient to confer polarity activity to DFz2 This suggests that Fz has an intrinsic capacity for polarity signaling and that interaction with Wg couples it to the Wnt pathway View

proteins in the intact organism and to explore the question of specificity of interactions in vivo we have conducted a genetic analysis of frizzled and Dfrizzled2 in the embryo These experiments utilize a small deficiency that uncovers Dfrizzled2 Mutants lacking maternal frizzled and zygotic frizzled and Dfrizzled2 exhibit defects in the embryonic epidermis CNS heart and midgut that are indistinguishable from those observed in wingless mutants Epidermal patterning defects in the frizzled Dfrizzled2 embryos can be rescued by ectopic expression of either gene In frizzled Dfrizzled2 mutant embryos ectopic production of Wingless does not detectably alter the epidermal patterning defect but ectopic production of an activated form of Armadillo produces a naked cuticle phenotype indistinguishable from that produced by ectopic production of activated Armadillo in embryos These experiments indicate that frizzled and Dfrizzled2 function downstream of wingless and upstream of armadillo consistent with their proposed roles as Wingless receptors The lack of an effect on epidermal patterning of ectopic Wingless in a frizzled Dfrizzled2 double mutant argues against the existence of additional Wingless receptors in the embryo or a model in which Frizzled and Dfrizzled2 act simply to present the ligand to its bona fide receptor These data lead to the conclusion that Frizzled and Dfrizzled2 function as redundant Wingless receptors in multiple embryonic tissues and that this role is accurately reflected in tissue culture experiments The redundancy of Frizzled and

Abstract Characterization of the molecular pathways controlling differentiation and proliferation in mammalian hair follicles is central to our understanding of the regulation of normal hair growth the basis of hereditary hair loss diseases and the origin of tumors We demonstrate that the Wnt3 which encodes a secreted paracrine signaling molecule is expressed in developing and mature hair follicles and that its overexpression in transgenic mouse skin causes a phenotype due to altered differentiation of hair shaft precursor cells and cyclical balding resulting from hair shaft structural defects and associated with an abnormal profile of protein expression in the hair shaft A putative effector molecule for WNT3 signaling the cytoplasmic protein Dishevelled 2 DVL2 is normally present at high levels in a subset of cells in the outer root sheath and in precursor cells of the hair shaft cortex and cuticle which lie immediately adjacent to cells Overexpression of Dvl2 in the outer root sheath mimics the phenotype produced by overexpression of Wnt3 supporting the hypothesis that Wnt3 and Dvl2 have the potential to act in the same pathway in the regulation of hair growth These experiments demonstrate a previously unrecognized role for WNT signaling in the control of hair growth and structure as well as presenting the first example of a mammalian phenotype resulting from

We report here that a secreted glycoprotein related to wingless is a signal required for cell fate determination and morphogenesis in the developing male reproductive tract Testes from null mutant flies lack the pigment cells of the reproductive tract sheath and the muscle precursors of the sheath fail to migrate normally However other cell types of the testis are unaffected is expressed in somatic cells of the gonad throughout development implicating it as a signal that can influence pigment cell fate directly Indeed the ectopic expression of in females results in the appearance of pigment cells in otherwise morphologically normal ovaries Thus the presence of pigment cells is a sexually dimorphic trait that is controlled by expression is also expressed in regions of the male

DEVELOPMENT Lessing Nusse 1998 125 8 Abstract Patterning of the Drosophila embryo depends on the accurate expression of wingless wg which encodes a secreted signal required for segmentation and many other processes Early expression of wg is regulated by the nuclear proteins of the gap and gene classes but after gastrulation wg transcription is also dependent on communication Signaling to the cells is mediated by the secreted protein Hedgehog Hh and by Cubitus interruptus Ci a transcriptional effector of the Hh signal transduction pathway The transmembrane protein Patched Ptc acts as a negative regulator of wg expression embryos have ectopic wg expression According to the current models Ptc is a receptor for Hh The default activity of Ptc is to inhibit Ci function when Ptc binds Hh this inhibition is released and Ci can control wg transcription We have investigated sequences that regulate wg during the time that wg expression depends on Hh signaling We show that approximately kb immediately upstream of the wg transcription unit can direct expression of the reporter gene lacZ in domains similar to the normal wg pattern in the embryonic ectoderm Expression of this reporter construct expands in ptc mutants and responds to hh activity Within this kb a 150 bp element highly conserved between melanogaster and Drosophila virilis is required to spatially restrict wg transcription Activity of this element depends on ptc but it contains no consensus sites The discovery of an element that is likely to bind a transcriptional repressor was unexpected since the prevailing model suggests that wg expression is principally controlled by Hh signaling acting through the Ci activator We show that wg regulatory DNA can drive lacZ in a proper pattern without any

Williams syndrome WS is a developmental disorder with a characteristic personality and cognitive profile that is associated in most cases with a 2 Mb deletion of part of chromosome band By applying CpG island cloning methods to cosmids from the deletion region we have identified a new gene called FZD3 Dosage blotting of DNA from 11 WS probands confirmed that it is located within the commonly

eye We have found that wingless when expressed ectopically in the eye via the sevenless promoter blocks this process Transgenic eyes have reduced expression of acheate suggesting that wingless acts at the level of the proneural genes to block bristle development This is in contrast to the wing where wingless positively regulates acheate to promote bristle formation The sevenless promoter is not active in the cells indicating that the wingless is acting in a paracrine manner Clonal analysis revealed a requirement for the genes porcupine dishevelled and armadillo in mediating the wingless effect Overexpression of zeste partially blocks the ability of wingless to inhibit bristle formation consistent with the notion that wingless acts in opposition to zeste Thus the wingless signaling pathway in the eye appears to be very similar to that described in the embryo and wing The Notch gene product has also been suggested to play a role in wingless signaling Couso and Martinez Arias 1994 Cell 79 Because Notch has many functions during eye development including its role in inhibiting bristle formation through the neurogenic pathway it is difficult to assess the relationship of Notch to wingless in the eye However we present evidence that wingless signaling still occurs normally in the complete absence of Notch protein in the embryonic epidermis Thus in the simplest model for

the initial signaling between wingless and engrailed expressing cells we have previously used a transgenic Drosophila strain that expresses wingless under the control of the heat shock promoter Focusing on the later phases of wingless and engrailed regulation we have now extended these studies using embryos carrying various combinations of segment polarity mutations and the transgene We confirm some of the existing models of regulation of the expression of wingless and engrailed In addition we find that embryos require engrailed for induction of ectopic endogenous wingless expression Signaling from engrailed cells to this novel wingless expression domain is dependent on hedgehog but also on porcupine We further demonstrate a novel requirement for hedgehog in maintenance of

Abstract Wingless Wg is an important signaling molecule in the development of Drosophila but little is known about its signal transduction pathway Genetic evidence indicates that another segment polarity gene dishevelled dsh is required for Wg signaling We have recently developed a cell culture system for Wg protein activity and using this in vitro system as well as intact Drosophila embryos we have analyzed biochemical changes in the Dsh protein as a consequence of Wg signaling We find that Dsh is a phosphoprotein normally present in the cytoplasm Wg signaling generates a hyperphosphorylated form of Dsh which is associated with a membrane fraction Overexpressed Dsh becomes hyperphosphorylated in the absence of extracellular Wg and increases levels of the Armadillo protein thereby mimicking the Wg signal A deletional analysis of Dsh identifies several conserved domains essential for activity among which is a motif We conclude that dsh a highly conserved gene is not merely a permissive factor in Wg signaling but encodes a novel signal transduction molecule which may function between the Wg receptor and more downstream signaling molecules View details for Web

MAINTENANCE OF EXPRESSION IN OF THE MOUSE CEREBELLUM DEPENDS ON INTERACTIONS WITH GRANULE CELLS DEVELOPMENT Salinas Fletcher Copeland Jenkins Nusse 1994 120 5 Abstract Wnt genes encode secreted

relatively simple structure and contains cell populations We found that is expressed during development of the cerebellum and that expression is restricted to the Purkinje cell layer in the adult expression in Purkinje cells increases postnatally as granule cells start to make contacts with Purkinje cells To investigate whether interactions with granule cells influence expression in Purkinje cells we examined gene expression in several mouse mutants using the expression of to follow the fate of granule cells In the weaver mutant in which granule cells fail to migrate and subsequently die

Drosophila Wnt gene wingless using a Drosophila imaginal disc cell line ref 13 and measured effects on the adherens junction protein armadillo a known genetic target of wingless Transfection of a wingless complementary DNA into cells increases the levels of the armadillo protein The wingless protein does not affect the rate of synthesis of armadillo but leads to increased stability of an otherwise rapidly decaying armadillo protein The wingless protein in the extracellular matrix and soluble medium from donor cells also increases the levels of armadillo protein The protein in the

dsh gene mediates these signaling events as well as induction across tissue layers in the embryonic midgut dsh is also required for the development processes in which wg functions in adult development Overall cells lacking dsh are unable to adopt fates specified by Wg dsh functions cell autonomously indicating that it is involved in the response of target cells to the Wg signal dsh is expressed uniformly in the embryo and encodes a novel protein with no known catalytic motifs although it shares a domain of homology with several proteins Our results demonstrate that dsh encodes a specific

Abstract We have characterized the molecular nature of mutations in wingless wg a segment polarity gene acting during various stages of Drosophila development alleles have undergone mutations in the domain of the gene including deletions and point mutations of conserved residues In a temperature sensitive mutation a conserved cysteine residue is replaced by a serine In alleles the wg transcriptional unit is not affected Immunostaining of mutant embryos shows that the alleles produce either no wg antigen or a form of the protein that is retained within cells Interestingly embryos mutant for the segment polarity gene porcupine show a similar retention of the wg antigen We have also transfected wild type wg alleles into Drosophila tissue culture cells which then display wg protein on the cell surface and in the extracellular matrix In similar experiments with mutant alleles the proteins are retained in intracellular compartments and appear not to be secreted These data

plays a pivotal role and is under direct control of the products of segment polarity genes Many of the cloned segment polarity genes have been found to be highly conserved in evolution providing a model system for cellular interactions in other organisms In Drosophila two of these genes engrailed and wingless are expressed on either side of the parasegment border wingless encodes a secreted molecule and engrailed a nuclear protein with a homeobox Maintenance of engrailed expression is dependent on wingless and vice versa To investigate the role of other segment polarity genes in the mutual control between these two genes we have examined wingless and engrailed protein distribution in embryos mutant for each of the segment polarity genes In embryos mutant for armadillo dishevelled and porcupine the changes in engrailed expression are identical to those in wingless mutant embryos suggesting that their gene products act in the wingless pathway In embryos mutant for hedgehog fused cubitus interruptus Dominant and gooseberry expression of engrailed is affected to varying degrees However wingless expression in the latter group decays in a similar way earlier than engrailed

during various stages of Drosophila development The wingless gene encodes a secreted protein that affects gene expression in surrounding cells but does not spread far from the cells where it is made In larvae wingless is necessary to generate naked cuticle in a restricted part of each segment To test whether the local accumulation of wingless is essential for its function we made transgenic flies that express wingless under the control of a hsp70 promoter flies Uniform wingless expression results in a complete naked cuticle uniform armadillo accumulation and broadening of the engrailed domain The expression patterns of patched cubitus interruptus Dominant and Ultrabithorax follow the change in engrailed The phenotype of heatshocked embryos resembles the segment polarity mutant naked suggesting that embryos that overexpress wingless or lack the naked gene enter similar developmental pathways The ubiquitous effects of ectopic wingless expression may indicate that most cells in the

sequence alterations in the LTR are responsible for the high expression of rearranged MMTV proviruses we made constructs in which normal and variant LTRs drive the bacterial reporter gene chloramphenicol acetyltransferase CAT Two different rearranged LTRs were used one containing a bp deletion L13 and another carrying a deletion plus an insertion L42 These constructs were transfected into murine GRSL and human lines that either had or had not been treated with phorbol ester TPA In GRSL cells the construct showed transcriptional activity that was further enhanced by TPA In cells both variant LTRs were active but only after stimulation with TPA In contrast normal N constructs were not expressed irrespective of TPA addition In XC rat fibrosarcoma cells neither normal nor variant LTRs gave rise to detectable CAT activity either in the presence or in the absence of TPA but dexamethasone strongly stimulated CAT activity driven by N and L42 LTRs The L13 LTR was considerably less active probably caused by the deletion of the distal part of the glucocorticoid responsive element We conclude that the LTR rearrangements generate TPA responsiveness and contribute

single new MMTV provirus and cloned a 19 kilobase kb DNA restriction fragment containing a junction of viral and host sequences Host sequences from this clone were used to retrieve 25 kb of the uninterrupted locus termed MMTV int1 from a bacteriophage library of normal mouse DNA Hybridization with subcloned DNA fragments of MMTV int1 detected abnormal restriction fragments in digests of DNA from 18 of 26 C3H mammary tumors The rearrangements all appeared to be due to the insertion of an MMTV provirus and the integration sites were located in at least five clusters over a total distance of 19 kb A polyadenylated kb RNA species transcribed from int1 was found in the few tumors tested but not in lactating mammary glands from C3H mice Of 12 tested viral oncogenes none exhibited homology with cloned DNA from this locus We propose that tumorigenesis by MMTV is strongly favored by proviral insertion within the int1 locus perhaps as a consequence of enhanced expression of a novel

replication in feline kidney cells had different isoelectric points This suggested that the acquisition of an altered carbohydrate configuration had changed the host range of the virus The major MMTV

on these GRSL cells can not be modulated under similar conditions These antigens include histocompatibility antigens of the complex of the and D of the haplotype and two thymic markers and Antigenic modulation of MLr as tested by exclusion and by chromium51 release does not lead to a measurable change in the expression of TL and antigens These results could be confirmed by absorption analysis The latter analysis showed that the number of antigenic sites per cell are about the same for MLr and the two antigens while TL antigens are scarcer and antigens are more abundant The procedure of antigenic modulation showed that the MLr antigen resides on MTVgp52 the major protein of the envelope There was no evidence of internal proteins such as MTVp27 on the surface of GRSL cells View

1979 31 1 Abstract The involvement of mouse mammary tumor virus MTV in the development of mammary tumors of nonviral etiology in mice was studied by measuring the levels of MTV RNA MTV DNA and MTV proteins in spontaneously arising and hormonally chemically physically induced mammary tumors of females The following results were obtained i Spontaneous mammary tumors contained very low levels of MTV RNA 4 X 10 of the the cytoplasmic RNA was MTV RNA No MTV proteins could be demonstrated by using sensitive radioimmunoassays for MTV proteins p27 and gp52 ii Mammary tumors induced by treatments with urethane or alone contained higher levels of MTV RNA these tumors contained and more MTV RNA respectively compared with spontaneous mammary tumors iii Mammary tumors induced by combined treatment with urethane and expressed high levels of MTV RNA in the mammary tumors a increase in MTV RNA content compared with spontaneous mammary tumors was observed However very low levels of MTV proteins gp52 and p27 were detected suggesting some kind of impairment at the translation of the MTV RNA MTV RNA was also induced by this treatment in mammary glands and spleens but not in the livers of animals iv females continuously exposed to prolactin contained high levels of MTV RNA and MTV proteins in stimulated mammary glands and in the hormonally induced mammary tumors These findings suggest that MTV is not responsible for the maintenance and probably also not for the development of all murine mammary cancers View details for Web of Science ID A1979HB43800008 View details for PubMedID

1979 62 4 Abstract The radioimmunoprecipitation assay for the murine mammary tumor virus MuMTV was used to detect naturally occurring antibodies against MuMTV in 3 groups of highly inbred mouse strains 1 Some strains had high incidences of mammary tumors such as strains GR and C3H Antibodies against MuMTV were detected in the sera of females of these strains at early ages 2 Some mouse strains had low incidences of mammary tumors with an intermediate MuMTV expression such as strains C3Hf RIIIf and Some females of these strains developed antibodies against MuMTV Hormone treatment of these mice resulted in an increase in the proportion of mice carrying antibodies against MuMTV 3 Some mouse strains were such as strains O20 C57BL and No antibodies against MuMTV were detected in the sera of these mice However antibodies against MuMTV appeared in the sera of these animals after hormone treatment The presence of a natural humoral immunity toward MuMTV appeared to be related to the expression of MuMTV in the animals View details for Web of Science ID A1979GS77300025 View details for PubMedID 219283 IMPAIRED MATURATION OF MOUSE VIRUS PRECURSOR POLYPEPTIDES IN LYMPHOID PRODUCING PARTICLES AND NO EXTRACELLULAR VIRIONS JOURNAL OF VIROLOGY Nusse VANDERPLOEG VANDUIJN Michalides Hilgers J 1979 32 1 Abstract Processing of polypeptides of the mouse mammary tumor virus a type B retrovirus was investigated in a transplanted thymic lymphoma cell line of the GR strain GRSL This cell line was maintained in vivo in ascites form and in vitro as a suspension culture GRSL cells produce clusters of intracytoplasmic A particles and are virtually deficient in the production of mature extracellular particles As control a mammary tumor cell line of the same mouse strain capable of complete virion synthesis was used The kinetics of viral polypeptide synthesis were studied by pulse labeling with various isotopes including 35 S and 32 P followed by immunoprecipitation of cell lysates with monospecific antisera to the major mouse mammary tumor virus gag and env proteins p27 and gp52 respectively Both the primary gag and env precursor polypeptides were synthesized in the GRSL cells but their conversion into viral proteins was impaired The major gag precursor Pr73 gag was stable over a period of 8 h and mature viral core polypeptides could not be detected Also the highly phosphorylated intermediates in the proteolytic processing of Pr73 gag in cells were absent in GRSL cells By immunoprecipitation Pr73 gag was detected in a GRSL particle fraction with the density of intracytoplasmic A particles The precursor for envelope proteins Pr73 env was turned over without the generation of mature viral envelope components gp52 and gp36 The in ascites GRSL cells however were shown to express gp52 on the cell surface together with a polypeptide as indicated by cell surface iodination and immunoprecipitation View details for Web of Science ID A1979HQ50600030

1978 27 3 Abstract The involvement of the mouse mammary tumor virus MTV in spontaneous and mammary tumors in mouse strains was studied by comparing the amounts of MTV RNA and MTV DNA sequences in mammary tumors and other tissues of mice with an without hormonal treatments The following results were obtained i Mammary tumors which appeared in C3H mice as a result of an infection with MTV contained more MTV DNA compared with noninfected organs these mammary tumors also contained more MTV RNA than was present in lactating mammary gland cells ii Hormonal stimulation by administration of excessive amounts of prolactin via hypophyseal isografts in C3Hf and O20 mice resulted in an increased expression of MTV RNA in the mammary glands This elevated level of MTV RNA expression was however not maintained in the mammary tumors iii Spontaneous mammary tumors in mice contained similar levels of MTV DNA and MTV RNA sequences as were found in other cells of these animals View details for Web

PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA Michalides VANDEEMTER Nusse VANNIE 1978 75 5 Abstract In the mouse strain GR the gene controls the expression of large amounts of mammary tumor virus MTV antigens in the milk at first lactation It also controls the early appearance of mammary tumors We have investigated the number of MTV proviral sequences associated with this gene by nucleic acid hybridization between MTV 3 H cDNA and DNA from GR B10 and mice B10 and mice lack gene expression The molecular hybridizations revealed that the DNA of GR mice contains 12 copies of MTV proviral sequences whereas only 4 copies are present in the DNA of B10 and mice We therefore conclude that the gene in the GR mouse strain is associated with eight additional MTV proviral sequences The four Mtv proviral sequences in the DNA might represent another Mtv gene in the GR mouse Different amounts of MTV RNA are detected in mammary glands at first lactation of B10 and mice even though both contain four copies of MTV proviral sequences This indicates a difference between these two mouse strains either in the regulation of expression of these MTV proviral sequences or in the location of these sequences in the murine genome View details for Web of Science ID A1978FB94300069 View details for PubMedID 209461 View details for PubMedCentralID PMC392554 RELATIONSHIP
