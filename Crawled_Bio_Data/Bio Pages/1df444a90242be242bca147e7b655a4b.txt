involves the mechanisms used to generate the organization of a cell from a genetic code Our goal is to define these mechanisms using both molecular genetics and biochemistry The developmental program by which a single cell proceeds to a organism involves cell divisions that yield dissimilar daughter cells The characteristics that differentiate one daughter cell from the other result from differential transcription and subcellular positioning of regulatory and structural proteins How this is brought about remains one of the most fundamental questions of developmental biology To approach this question we are studying a bacterial cell whose simple life cycle is focused on the generation of asymmetry in the predivisional cell We are using full genome sequence and microarray technology to identify the genetic circuitry that controls the cell cycle in a bacterial cell with 3767 genes Dynamic protein localization phosphorelay signaling cascades and spatially and temporally

America Zhou Wang Herrmann Moerner Shapiro 2019 Abstract The cell methylation state of Caulobacter DNA mediates the temporal control of transcriptional activation of several key regulatory proteins Temporally controlled synthesis of the CcrM DNA methyltransferase and proteolysis restrict CcrM to a specific time in the cell cycle thereby allowing the maintenance of the hemimethylated state of the chromosome during the progression of DNA replication We determined that a chromosomal platform stimulates CcrM degradation by Lon and that the CcrM C terminus both binds to its DNA substrate and is recognized by the Lon protease Upon asymmetric cell division swarmer and stalked progeny cells employ distinct mechanisms to control active CcrM In progeny swarmer cells CcrM is completely degraded by Lon before its differentiation into a stalked cell later in the cell cycle In progeny stalked cells however accumulated CcrM that has not been degraded before the immediate initiation of DNA replication is sequestered to the cell pole imaging demonstrated physical anticorrelation between sequestered CcrM and chromosomal DNA thus preventing DNA remethylation The distinct control of available CcrM in progeny swarmer and stalked cells serves to protect the hemimethylated state of DNA during chromosome replication enabling robustness of cell cycle progression View details for DOI

archaea possess a crystalline protein surface layer which surrounds their growing and topologically complicated outer surface Constructing a macromolecular structure of this scale generally requires localized enzymatic machinery but a regulatory framework for assembly has not been identified By labeling superresolution imaging and tracking the protein SLP from crescentus we show that 2D protein is sufficient to build and maintain the in living cells by efficient protein crystal nucleation and growth We propose a model supported by tracking whereby randomly secreted SLP monomers diffuse on the lipopolysaccharide LPS outer membrane until incorporated at the edges of growing 2D crystals Surface topology creates crystal defects and boundaries thereby guiding assembly Unsupervised assembly

reduced photobleaching rates a and rapid fixation method and the potential of correlation with cryogenic electron microscopy Achieving cryogenic microscopy requires the ability to control the sparsity of emissive labels at cryogenic temperatures Obtaining this control presents a key challenge for the development of this technique In this work we identify a red photoactivatable protein PAmKate which remains activatable at cryogenic temperatures We characterize its activation as a function of temperature and find that activation is efficient at cryogenic and room temperatures We perform cryogenic experiments in situ labeling PopZ a protein known to assemble into a microdomain at the poles of the model bacterium Caulobacter crescentus We find improved localization precision at cryogenic temperatures compared to room temperature by a factor of 4 attributable to reduced photobleaching View details for PubMedID 30222332 Integration of cell cycle signals by domain kinases Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America Mann Shapiro 2018 Abstract Spatial control of intracellular signaling relies on signaling proteins sensing their subcellular environment In many cases a large number of upstream signals are funneled to a master regulator of cellular behavior but it remains unclear how individual proteins can rapidly integrate a complex array of signals within the appropriate spatial niche within the cell As a model for how subcellular spatial information can control signaling activity we have reconstituted the cell control of the master regulator CckA from the asymmetrically dividing bacterium Caulobacter crescentus CckA is active as a kinase only when it accumulates within a microdomain at the new cell pole where it colocalizes with the pseudokinase DivL Both proteins contain multiple PAS domains a multifunctional class of sensory domains present across the kingdoms of life Here we show that CckA uses its PAS domains to integrate information from DivL and its own oligomerization state to control the balance of its kinase and phosphatase activities We reconstituted the complex on liposomes in vitro and found that DivL directly controls the CckA switch and that stimulation of either CckA catalytic activity depends on the second of its two PAS domains We further show that CckA oligomerizes through a multidomain interaction that is critical for stimulation of kinase activity by DivL while DivL stimulation of CckA phosphatase activity is independent of CckA homooligomerization Our results broadly demonstrate how signaling factors can leverage information from their subcellular niche to drive spatiotemporal control of cell signaling View details for PubMedID 29987042 Spatial organization and dynamics of RNase E and ribosomes in Caulobacter crescentus PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA Bayas Wang Lee Schrader Shapiro Moerner 2018 115 16 Abstract We report the dynamic spatial organization of Caulobacter crescentus RNase E RNA degradosome and ribosomal protein L1 ribosome using 3D tracking and superresolution microscopy RNase E formed clusters along the central axis of the cell while weak clusters of ribosomal protein L1 were deployed throughout the cytoplasm These results contrast with RNase E and ribosome distribution in Escherichia coli where RNase E colocalizes with the cytoplasmic membrane and ribosomes accumulate in polar zones For both RNase E and ribosomes in Caulobacter we observed a decrease in confinement and clustering upon transcription inhibition and subsequent depletion of nascent RNA suggesting that RNA substrate availability for processing degradation and translation facilitates confinement and clustering Importantly RNase E cluster positions correlated with the subcellular location of chromosomal loci of two highly transcribed rRNA genes suggesting that RNase E function in rRNA processing occurs at the site of rRNA synthesis Thus components of the RNA degradosome and ribosome assembly are spatiotemporally organized in Caulobacter with chromosomal readout serving as the template for this

Abstract Surface layers are paracrystalline proteinaceous structures found in most archaea and many bacteria Often the outermost cell envelope component serve diverse functions including aiding pathogenicity and protecting against predators We report that the of Caulobacter crescentus exhibits structural plasticity switching irreversibly between an amorphous aggregate state and the crystalline state This finding invalidates the common assumption that serve only as static structures In vitro the Caulobacter protein RsaA enters the aggregate state at physiological temperatures and low divalent calcium ion concentrations At higher concentrations calcium ions stabilize monomeric RsaA which can then transition to the crystalline state Caulobacter requires micromolar concentrations of calcium for normal growth and development Without an Caulobacter is even more sensitive to changes in environmental calcium concentration Therefore this structurally dynamic responds to environmental conditions as an ion sensor and protects Caulobacter from calcium deficiency stress a unique mechanism of bacterial adaptation These findings provide a biochemical and physiological basis for RsaA behavior which extends far beyond calcium commonly accepted role in aiding biogenesis or oligomerization and demonstrates a connection to cellular fitness View details for DOI View

mBio Perez Mann Lasker Ahrens Eckart Shapiro 2017 8 1 Abstract Signaling hubs at bacterial cell poles establish cell polarity in the absence of compartments In the asymmetrically dividing bacterium Caulobacter crescentus cell polarity stems from the cell localization and turnover of signaling protein complexes in these hubs and yet the mechanisms that establish the identity of the two cell poles have not been established Here we recapitulate the tripartite assembly of a cell fate signaling complex that forms during the transition Using in vivo and in vitro analyses of dynamic polar protein complex formation we show that a polymeric cell polarity protein SpmX serves as a direct bridge between the PopZ polymeric network and the cell DivJ histidine kinase We demonstrate the direct binding between these three proteins and show that a polar microdomain spontaneously assembles when the three proteins are coexpressed heterologously in an Escherichia coli test system The relative copy numbers of these proteins are essential for complex formation as overexpression of SpmX in Caulobacter reorganizes the polarity of the cell generating ectopic cell poles containing PopZ and DivJ Hierarchical formation of SpmX oligomers nucleates new PopZ microdomain assemblies at the incipient lateral cell poles driving localized outgrowth By comparison to protein networks and polar cell growth mechanisms in other bacterial species we suggest that the cooligomeric protein complex in Caulobacter illustrates a paradigm for coupling cell cycle progression to the controlled geometry of cell pole Lacking internal compartments bacteria achieve subcellular organization by establishing microdomains The asymmetrically dividing bacterium Caulobacter crescentus uses one such microdomain to link cell cycle progression to morphogenesis but the mechanism for the generation of this microdomain has remained unclear Here we demonstrate that the ordered assembly of this microdomain occurs via the polymeric network protein PopZ directly recruiting the polarity factor SpmX which then recruits the histidine kinase DivJ to the developing cell pole Further we find that overexpression of the bridge protein SpmX in Caulobacter disrupts this ordered assembly generating ectopic cell poles containing both PopZ and DivJ Together PopZ and SpmX assemble into a cooligomeric network that forms the basis for a polar microdomain that coordinates bacterial cell polarity View details for DOI View details for PubMedID 28246363 View details for PubMedCentralID PMC5347347 Microscopy and Tracking in Live Bacteria Using a Genetically Encoded Photostable Fluoromodule Current protocols in cell biology Saurabh Perez Comerci Shapiro Moerner 2017 75 Abstract Visualization of dynamic protein structures in live cells is crucial for understanding the mechanisms governing biological processes Fluorescence microscopy is a sensitive tool for this purpose In order to image proteins in live bacteria using fluorescence microscopy one typically genetically fuses the protein of interest to a photostable fluorescent tag Several labeling schemes are available to accomplish this Particularly hybrid tags that combine a fluorescent or fluorogenic dye with a genetically encoded protein such as enzymatic labels have been used successfully in multiple cell types However their use in bacteria has been limited due to challenges imposed by a complex bacterial cell wall Here we describe the use of a genetically encoded photostable fluoromodule that can be targeted to cytosolic and membrane proteins in the Gram negative bacterium Caulobacter crescentus Additionally we summarize methods to use this fluoromodule for single protein imaging and microscopy using stimulated emission depletion 2017 by John

Li Childers Perez Weissman Shapiro McAdams 2016 113 44 Abstract Progression of the Caulobacter cell cycle requires temporal and spatial control of gene expression culminating in an asymmetric cell division yielding distinct daughter cells To explore the contribution of translational control and ribosome profiling were used to assay global transcription and translation levels of individual genes at six times over the cell cycle Translational efficiency TE was used as a metric for the relative rate of protein production from each mRNA TE profiles with similar cell cycle patterns were found across multiple clusters of genes including those in operons or in subsets of operons Collections of genes associated with central cell cycle functional modules biosynthesis of stalk flagellum or chemotaxis machinery have consistent but different TE temporal patterns independent of their operon organization Differential translation of genes facilitates precise cell for the dynamic assembly of multiprotein complexes such as the flagellum and the stalk and the correct positioning of regulatory proteins to specific cell poles The cell pathways that produce specific temporal TE patterns are separate highly coordinated transcriptional cell cycle circuitry suggesting that the scheduling of translational regulation is organized by the same cyclical regulatory circuit that directs the transcriptional control of the Caulobacter cell cycle View details for PubMedID 27791168 Cell cycle progression in Caulobacter requires a protein with high AT sequence recognition PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA Ricci Melfi Lasker Dill McAdams Shapiro 2016 113 40 Abstract Faithful cell cycle progression in the dimorphic bacterium Caulobacter crescentus requires spatiotemporal regulation of gene expression and cell pole differentiation We discovered an essential protein GapR that is required for Caulobacter growth and asymmetric division GapR interacts with adenine and thymine AT chromosomal loci associates with the promoter regions of cell genes and shares hundreds of recognition sites in common with known master regulators of cell gene expression GapR target loci are especially enriched in binding sites for the transcription factors GcrA and CtrA and overlap with nearly all of the binding sites for MucR1 a regulator that controls the establishment of swarmer cell fate Despite constitutive synthesis GapR accumulates preferentially in the swarmer compartment of the predivisional cell Homologs of GapR which are ubiquitous among the and are encoded on multiple bacteriophage genomes also accumulate in the predivisional cell swarmer compartment when expressed in Caulobacter The Escherichia coli protein like GapR selectively associates with DNA yet it does not localize preferentially to the swarmer compartment when expressed exogenously in Caulobacter suggesting that recognition of DNA is not sufficient for the asymmetric accumulation of GapR Further GapR does not silence the expression of target genes when expressed in coli suggesting that GapR and have distinct functions We propose that Caulobacter

Cellular functions in Bacteria such as chromosome segregation and cytokinesis result from cascades of molecular events operating largely as modules Regulated timing of these cellular modules stems from global genetic circuits that allow precise temporal activation with respect to cell cycle progression and cell differentiation Critically many of these functions occur at defined locations within the cell and therefore regulators of each module must communicate to remain coordinated in space In this perspective we highlight recent discoveries in Caulobacter crescentus asymmetric cell division

governing cellular processes at the molecular level In particular microscopy methods overcome the diffraction limit to observe nanoscale cellular structures with unprecedented detail and tracking provides precise dynamic information about the motions of labeled proteins and oligonucleotides Enhanced photostability of fluorescent labels maximum emitted photons before photobleaching is a critical requirement for achieving the ultimate resolution with either method While imaging has greatly benefited from highly photostable fluorophores a shortage of photostable fluorescent labels for bacteria has limited its use in these small but relevant organisms In this study we report the use of a highly photostable fluoromodule dL5 to genetically label proteins in the bacterium Caulobacter crescentus enabling protein tracking and microscopy dL5 imaging relies on the activation of the fluorogen Malachite Green MG and can be used to label proteins sparsely enabling detection in live bacteria without initial bleaching steps complexes emit more photons before photobleaching compared to organic dyes such as Cy5 and Alexa 647 in vitro and more photons compared to eYFP in vivo We imaged fusions of dL5 to three different proteins in live Caulobacter cells using stimulated emission depletion microscopy yielding a resolution enhancement compared to imaging Importantly dL5 fusions

Shapiro 2015 2 1 Abstract Bacteria face complex decisions when initiating developmental events such as sporulation nodulation virulence and asymmetric cell division These developmental decisions require global changes in genomic readout and bacteria typically employ intricate yet poorly understood signaling networks that enable changes in cell function The bacterium Caulobacter crescentus divides asymmetrically to yield two functionally distinct cells a motile chemotactic swarmer cell and a sessile stalked cell with replication and division capabilities Work from several Caulobacter labs has revealed that differentiation requires concerted regulation by several system TCS signaling pathways that are differentially positioned at the poles of the predivisional cell Figure 1 The strict unidirectional flow from histidine kinase HK to the response regulator RR observed in most studied TCS is difficult to reconcile with the notion that information can be transmitted between two or more TCS signaling pathways In this study we uncovered a mechanism by which daughter cell fate which is specified by the system and effectively encoded in the phosphorylation state of the RR DivK is communicated to the signaling pathway that regulates more than 100 genes for polar differentiation replication initiation and cell division Using structural biology and biochemical findings we proposed a mechanistic basis for TCS pathway coupling in which the DivL pseudokinase is repurposed as a sensor rather than participant in phosphotransduction View details for PubMedID 28357261 The

the mechanisms that underlie the coordination of chromosome replication and segregation are poorly understood Here we report that the conserved replication initiator DnaA can mediate chromosome segregation independent of replication initiation It does so by binding directly to the parS centromere region of the chromosome and mutations that alter this interaction result in cells that display aberrant centromere translocation and cell division We propose that DnaA serves to coordinate bacterial DNA replication with the onset of chromosome segregation View details for DOI View details for

substrate of both ClpXP and ClpAP in vitro but is primarily degraded by ClpAP in vivo Caulobacter carries out an asymmetric division in which FtsZ and FtsA are stable in stalked cells but degraded in the swarmer cell where ClpAP alone degrades FtsA and both ClpAP and ClpXP degrade FtsZ While asymmetric division in Caulobacter normally yields larger stalked and smaller swarmer daughters we observe a loss of asymmetric size distribution among daughter cells when clpA is depleted from a strain in which FtsZ is constitutively produced Taken together these results suggest that the activity of both ClpXP and ClpAP on divisome substrates is differentially regulated in daughter cells View details for DOI View details for Web of Science ID 000341639600002 View details for PubMedID 24989075 The

crescentus undergoes an asymmetric cell division controlled by a genetic circuit that cycles in space and time We provide a universal strategy for defining the coding potential of bacterial genomes by applying ribosome profiling global and liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry data to the crescentus genome We mapped transcript units at single resolution using together with global Additionally using ribosome profiling and we mapped translation start sites and coding regions with near complete coverage We found most start codons lacked corresponding sites although ribosomes were observed to pause at internal sites within the coding DNA sequence CDS These data suggest a more prevalent use of the sequence for ribosome pausing rather than translation initiation in crescentus Overall 19 of the transcribed and translated genomic elements were newly identified or significantly improved by this approach providing a valuable genomic resource to elucidate the

Moerner Shapiro 2014 111 19 Abstract Bacteria use partitioning systems based on the ParA ATPase to actively mobilize and spatially organize molecular cargoes throughout the cytoplasm The bacterium Caulobacter crescentus uses a partitioning system to segregate newly replicated chromosomal centromeres to opposite cell poles Here we demonstrate that the Caulobacter PopZ scaffold creates an organizing center at the cell pole that actively regulates polar centromere transport by the ParA partition system As segregation proceeds the centromere complex is moved by progressively disassembling ParA from a structure Using superresolution microscopy we show that released ParA is recruited directly to binding sites within a 3D ultrastructure composed of PopZ at the cell pole whereas the complex remains at the periphery of the PopZ structure PopZ recruitment of ParA stimulates ParA to assemble on the nucleoid near the cell pole We identify mutations in PopZ that allow scaffold assembly but specifically abrogate interactions with ParA and demonstrate that interactions are required for proper chromosome segregation in vivo We propose that during segregation PopZ sequesters free ParA and induces regeneration of ParA DNA binding activity to enforce processive and centromere segregation preventing segregation reversals PopZ therefore functions as a polar hub complex at the cell pole to directly regulate the directionality and destination of transfer of the mitotic segregation machine View details for DOI View details for PubMedID 24778223 The functions of DNA methylation by CcrM in Caulobacter crescentus a global approach Nucleic acids research Gonzalez Kozdon J McAdams Shapiro Collier J 2014 42 6 Abstract DNA methylation is involved in a diversity of processes in bacteria including maintenance of genome integrity and regulation of gene expression Here using Caulobacter crescentus as a model we exploit experimental methods to uncover the functions of CcrM a DNA methyltransferase conserved in most Alphaproteobacteria Using single molecule sequencing we provide evidence that most CcrM target motifs GANTC switch from a fully methylated to a state when they are replicated and back to a fully methylated state at the onset of cell division We show that DNA methylation by CcrM is not required for the control of the initiation of chromosome replication or for DNA mismatch repair By contrast our transcriptome analysis shows that 10 of the genes are misexpressed in cells lacking or constitutively CcrM Strikingly GANTC methylation is needed for the efficient transcription of dozens of genes that are essential for cell cycle progression in particular for DNA metabolism and cell division Many of them are controlled by promoters methylated by CcrM and by other global cell cycle regulators demonstrating an extensive cross talk between DNA methylation and the complex regulatory network that controls the cell cycle of crescentus and presumably of many other Alphaproteobacteria View details for DOI View details for PubMedID 24398711 View details for PubMedCentralID PMC3973325 Systems architecture of a bacterial cell cycle Shapiro

45 Abstract During cell division multiple processes are highly coordinated to faithfully generate genetically equivalent daughter cells In bacteria the mechanisms that underlie the coordination of chromosome replication and segregation are poorly understood Here we report that the conserved replication initiator DnaA can mediate chromosome segregation independent of replication initiation It does so by binding directly to the parS centromere region of the chromosome and mutations that alter this interaction result in cells that display aberrant centromere translocation and cell division

2013 110 48 Abstract The Caulobacter DNA methyltransferase CcrM is one of five master regulators CcrM is transiently present near the end of DNA replication when it rapidly methylates the adenine in hemimethylated GANTC sequences The timing of transcription of two master regulator genes and two cell division genes is controlled by the methylation state of GANTC sites in their promoters To explore the global extent of this regulatory mechanism we determined the methylation state of the entire chromosome at every base pair at five time points in the cell cycle using sequencing The methylation state of GANTC sites preferentially positioned in intergenic regions changed progressively from full to hemimethylation as the replication forks advanced However 27 GANTC sites remained unmethylated throughout the cell cycle suggesting that these protected sites could participate in epigenetic regulatory functions An analysis of the time of activation of every regulatory transcription start site coupled to both the position of a GANTC site in their promoter regions and the time in the cell cycle when the GANTC site transitions from full to hemimethylation allowed the identification of 59 genes as candidates for epigenetic regulation In addition we identified two previously unidentified N 6 motifs and showed that they maintained a constant methylation state throughout the cell cycle The cognate methyltransferase was identified for one of these motifs as well as for one of two motifs View details for DOI View details for PubMedID 24218615 Oligomerization and assembly contribute to

asymmetric cell division by recruiting distinct sets of binding partners to opposite cell poles To understand how polar organizing centres are established by PopZ we investigated a set of mutated PopZ proteins for defects in localization and recruitment activity We identified a domain within the 76 amino acids that is necessary and sufficient for accumulation as a single subcellular focus a domain within the 23 amino acids that is necessary for bipolar targeting and a linker domain between these localization determinants that tolerates large variation Mutations that inhibited dynamic PopZ localization inhibited the recruitment of other factors to cell poles Mutations in the domain also blocked discrete steps in the assembly of structures Biophysical analysis of purified wild type and assembly defective mutant proteins indicates that PopZ into an elongated trimer which readily forms a dimer of trimers through lateral contact The final six amino acids of PopZ are necessary for

supercoiled polymer in a confinement PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA Hong Toro Mortensen de la Rosa Doniach Shapiro Spakowitz McAdams 2013 110 5 Abstract We measured the distance between DNA loci of various interloci contour lengths in Caulobacter crescentus swarmer cells to determine the in vivo configuration of the chromosome For DNA segments less than about 300 kb the mean interloci distances scale as n where n is the contour length and distribution of the interloci distance r is a universal function of with broad variability For DNA segments greater than about 300 kb the mean interloci distances scale as n in agreement with previous observations The value of the scaling exponent for short DNA segments is consistent with theoretical predictions for a branched DNA polymer structure Predictions from Brownian dynamics simulations of the packing of supercoiled DNA polymers in an elongated confinement are also consistent with a branched DNA structure and simulated interloci distance distributions predict that confinement leads to freezing of the supercoiled configuration Lateral positions of labeled loci at comparable positions along the length of the cell are strongly correlated when the longitudinal locus positions differ by μm We conclude that the chromosome structure is supercoiled locally and elongated at large length scales and that substantial variability in the interloci distances indicates that in vivo crowding prevents the chromosome from reaching an equilibrium arrangement We suggest that the force causing rapid transport of loci remote from the parS centromere to the distal cell pole may arise from the release at the polar region of potential energy within the supercoiled DNA View details

12 Abstract The synthesis of the peptidoglycan cell wall is carefully regulated in time and space In nature this essential process occurs in cells that live in fluctuating environments Here we show that the spatial distributions of specific cell wall proteins in Caulobacter crescentus are sensitive to small external osmotic upshifts The protein PBP2 which is commonly branded as an essential cell transpeptidase switches its localization from a dispersed patchy pattern to an accumulation at the FtsZ ring location in response to osmotic upshifts as low as 40 This relocation to the division apparatus is initiated within less than a minute while restoration to the patchy localization pattern is dependent on cell growth and takes 1 to 2 generations Cell wall morphogenetic protein RodA and protein PBP1a also change their spatial distribution by accumulating at the division site in response to external osmotic upshifts Consistent with its ecological distribution crescentus displays a narrow range of osmotolerance with an upper limit of 225 in minimal medium Collectively our findings reveal an unsuspected level of environmental regulation of cell wall protein behavior that is

Elsliger Deacon Godzik Lesley Figurski Shapiro Wilson I A 2012 83 4 Abstract The tad tight adherence locus encodes a protein translocation system that produces a novel variant of type IV pili The pilus assembly protein TadZ called CpaE in Caulobacter crescentus is ubiquitous in tad loci but is absent in other type IV pilus biogenesis systems The crystal structure of TadZ from Eubacterium rectale ErTadZ in complex with ATP and Mg was determined to Å resolution ErTadZ contains an atypical ATPase domain with a variant of a deviant motif that retains ATP binding capacity while displaying only low intrinsic ATPase activity The bound ATP plays an important role in dimerization of ErTadZ The atypical receiver domain resembles the canonical receiver domain of response regulators but has a degenerate site Homology modelling of the atypical receiver domain of CpaE indicates that it has a conserved binding surface similar to that of the polar localization module of the social mobility protein FrzS suggesting a similar function Our structural results also suggest that TadZ localizes to the pole through the atypical receiver domain during an early stage of pili biogenesis and

Accurate replication and segregation of the bacterial genome are essential for cell cycle progression We have identified a single amino acid substitution in the Caulobacter structural maintenance of chromosomes SMC protein that disrupts chromosome segregation and cell division The E1076Q point mutation in the SMC ATPase domain caused a phenotype in which DNA replication was able to proceed but

chromosomes remained unsegregated and appeared to be stacked upon one another Purified was deficient in ATP hydrolysis and exhibited abnormally stable binding to DNA We propose that SMC spuriously links the duplicated chromosome immediately after passage of the replication fork In cells ATP hydrolysis opens the SMC dimer freeing one chromosome to segregate to the opposite pole The loss of ATP

models of the Caulobacter genome The resulting models illustrate that the genome is ellipsoidal with periodically arranged arms The parS sites a pair of short contiguous sequence elements known to be involved in chromosome segregation are positioned at one pole where they anchor the chromosome to the cell and contribute to the formation of a compact chromatin conformation Repositioning these elements resulted in rotations of the chromosome that changed the subcellular positions of most genes Such rotations did not lead to changes in gene expression indicating that genome folding does not

near the nucleotide binding site of MreB Mutations that alter cell curvature and mislocalize the intermediate filament crescentin cluster on the back surface of MreB structure Another subset have

ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA Tan Kozdon J Shen Shapiro McAdams 2010 107 44 Abstract A cyclical control circuit composed of four master regulators drives the Caulobacter cell cycle We report that SciP a transcription factor is an essential component of this circuit SciP is cell and with the global cell cycle regulator CtrA in the SciP is expressed late in the cell cycle and accumulates preferentially in the daughter swarmer cell At least 58 genes including many flagellar and chemotaxis genes are regulated by a type 1 incoherent feedforward motif in which CtrA activates sciP followed by SciP repression of ctrA and CtrA target genes We demonstrate that SciP binds to DNA at a motif distinct from the CtrA binding motif that is present in the promoters of genes by SciP and CtrA SciP overexpression disrupts the balance between activation and repression of the coregulated genes yielding filamentous cells and loss of viability The type 1 incoherent feedforward circuit motif enhances the expression of the downstream genes and the negative feedback to ctrA expression reduces peak CtrA accumulation The presence of SciP in the control network enhances the

Comolli Downing Shapiro McAdams 2010 192 19 Abstract Cell division in Caulobacter crescentus involves constriction and fission of the inner membrane IM followed about 20 min later by fission of the outer membrane OM and daughter cell separation In contrast to Escherichia coli the Caulobacter complex is essential microscopy images of the Caulobacter cell envelope exhibited outer membrane disruption and cells failed to complete cell division in TolA TolB or Pal mutant strains In cells components of the complex localize to the division plane in early predivisional cells and remain predominantly at the new pole of swarmer and stalked progeny upon completion of division The complex is required to maintain the position of the transmembrane TipN polar marker and indirectly the PleC histidine kinase at the cell pole but it is not required for the polar maintenance of other transmembrane and polar proteins tested Coimmunoprecipitation experiments show that both TolA and Pal interact directly or indirectly with TipN We propose that disruption of the complex releases TipN from its subcellular position The Caulobacter complex is thus a key component of cell envelope

overexpression screen for growth inhibition along with sequence conservation in a related Caulobacter species led to the identification of a novel sRNA CrfA that is specifically induced upon carbon starvation genes were found to be strongly activated by CrfA accumulation of these target genes encode putative receptors suggesting CrfA plays a role in the surface modification of crescentus facilitating the uptake of nutrients during periods of carbon starvation The mechanism of gene activation was investigated for one of the genes predicted to encode a receptor CC3461 CrfA functions to stabilize the CC3461 transcript Complementarity between a region of CrfA and the terminal region of the CC3461 region and also the behavior of a deletion of this region and a base substitution and a

recently a dedicated mitotic apparatus that segregates newly replicated chromosomes into daughter cells was believed to be unique to eukaryotic cells Here we demonstrate that the bacterium Caulobacter crescentus segregates its chromosome using a partitioning Par apparatus that has surprising similarities to eukaryotic spindles We show that the crescentus ATPase ParA forms linear polymers in vitro and assembles into a narrow linear structure in vivo The protein ParB binds to and destabilizes ParA structures in vitro We propose that this ParA depolymerization activity moves the centromere to the opposite cell pole through a burnt bridge Brownian ratchet mechanism Finally we identify the TipN protein as a new component of the Par system that is required to maintain the directionality of DNA transfer towards the new cell pole Our results elucidate a bacterial chromosome segregation mechanism that features basic operating principles similar to eukaryotic mitotic machines including a

Progression Are Dependent on DNA Replication Initiation JOURNAL OF BACTERIOLOGY Iniesta A Hillson Shapiro 2010 192 15 Abstract Caulobacter crescentus initiates a single round of DNA replication during each cell cycle Following the initiation of DNA replication the essential CckA histidine kinase is activated by phosphorylation which via the ChpT phosphotransferase enables the phosphorylation and activation of the CtrA global regulator CtrA approximately P then blocks the reinitiation of replication while regulating the transcription of a large number of cell genes It has been shown that DNA replication serves as a checkpoint for flagellar biosynthesis and cell division and that this checkpoint is mediated by the availability of active CtrA Because CckA approximately P promotes the activation of CtrA we addressed the question of what controls the temporal activation of CckA We found that the initiation of DNA replication is a prerequisite for remodeling the new cell pole which includes the localization of the DivL protein kinase to that pole and consequently the localization autophosphorylation and activation of CckA at that pole Thus CckA activation is dependent on polar remodeling and a DNA replication initiation checkpoint that is tightly integrated with the polar cascade governing cell cycle progression View details for DOI View details for Web of Science ID

Goley Comolli Fero Downing Shapiro 2010 77 1 Abstract Cell division in organisms requires coordinated invagination of the multilayered cell envelope such that each daughter receives an intact inner membrane peptidoglycan PG layer and outer membrane OM Here we identify DipM a putative LytM endopeptidase in Caulobacter crescentus and show that it plays a critical role in maintaining cell envelope architecture during growth and division DipM localized to the division site in an manner via its LysM domains Although not essential for viability DeltadipM cells exhibited gross morphological defects including cell widening and filamentation indicating a role in cell shape maintenance and division that we show requires its LytM domain Strikingly cells lacking DipM also showed OM blebbing at the division site at cell poles and along the cell body Cryo electron tomography of sacculi isolated from cells depleted of DipM revealed marked thickening of the PG as compared to wild type which we hypothesize leads to loss of contacts between components of the complex We conclude that DipM is required for normal envelope invagination during division and to maintain a sacculus of constant

the control of cell cycle events the factors that signal its activation at a specific time in the cell cycle have remained elusive A conditional genetic screen for CckA mislocalization mutants using automated fluorescence microscopy and an image processing platform revealed that the essential DivL protein kinase promotes CckA localization autophosphorylation and activity at the new cell pole The transient accumulation of DivL at the new cell pole but not its kinase activity is required for the localization and activation of CckA Because DivL and CckA accumulate at the same cell pole after the

composition and function MOLECULAR MICROBIOLOGY Bowman Comolli Gaietta Fero Hong Jones Lee Downing Ellisman McAdams Shapiro 2010 76 1 Abstract The bacterium Caulobacter crescentus has morphologically and functionally distinct cell poles that undergo sequential changes during the cell cycle We show that the PopZ oligomeric network forms polar ribosome exclusion zones that change function during cell cycle progression The chromosomal centromere is tethered to PopZ at one pole prior to the initiation of DNA replication During polar maturation the tether is broken and the PopZ zone at that pole then switches function to act as a recruitment factor for the ordered addition of multiple proteins that promote the transformation of the flagellated pole into a stalked pole Stalked pole assembly in turn triggers the initiation of chromosome replication which signals the formation of a new PopZ zone at the opposite cell pole where it functions to anchor the newly duplicated centromere that has traversed the long axis of the cell We propose that control of PopZ function polar development and cell cycle progression by enabling independent assembly and tethering activities at the two cell

replication initiation is controlled by both CtrA and DnaA CtrA binds to and silences the origin Upon the clearance of CtrA from the cell the DnaA protein accumulates and allows loading of the replisome at the origin Here we identify an additional layer of replication initiation control that is mediated by the HdaA protein In Escherichia coli the Hda protein inactivates DnaA after replication initiation We show that the Caulobacter HdaA homologue is necessary to restrict the initiation of DNA replication to only once per cell cycle and that it dynamically colocalizes with the replisome throughout the cell cycle Moreover the transcription of hdaA is directly activated by DnaA providing a robust feedback regulatory mechanism that adjusts the levels of HdaA to inactivate DnaA

localization is an integral component of the regulatory circuit that drives the Caulobacter cell cycle The ClpXP protease is localized to the Caulobacter cell pole where it catalyzes the degradation of the CtrA master regulator at specific times in the cell cycle Clearance of active CtrA at the transition allows the initiation of DNA replication and progression The polar localization of ClpXP is dependent on the polar positioning of the CpdR response regulator Only the unphosphorylated form of CpdR localizes and activates ClpXP We demonstrate that another single domain response regulator DivK promotes the polar accumulation of unphosphorylated CpdR and that CpdR is subsequently degraded at the cell pole by the localized ClpXP protease Thus CpdR function is regulated by a feedback loop that incorporates its differential phosphorylation the transient polar localization and activity of the ClpXP protease and the clearance of the CpdR by polar ClpXP that in turn releases ClpXP from the pole relieving the degradation of CtrA CtrA approximately P then accumulates and activates the transcription of cpdR completing the regulatory loop establishing an integrated network that controls a robust

chromosome segregation Caulobacter has a single circular chromosome whose origin of replication is positioned at one cell pole Upon initiation of replication an region of the chromosome containing both the origin and parS moves rapidly to the opposite pole This movement requires the highly conserved ParABS locus that is essential in Caulobacter We use chromosomal inversions and in vivo imaging to show that parS is the Caulobacter site of force exertion independent of its position in the chromosome When parS is moved farther from the origin the cell waits for parS to be replicated before segregation can begin Also a mutation in the ATPase domain of ParA halts segregation without affecting replication initiation Chromosome segregation in Caulobacter can not occur unless a dedicated

temporally coordinated in Caulobacter crescentus This oligotrophic bacterium divides asymmetrically to produce a motile swarmer cell that represses DNA replication and a sessile stalked cell that replicates its DNA The initiation of DNA replication coincides with the proteolysis of the CtrA replication inhibitor and the accumulation of DnaA the replication initiator upon differentiation of the swarmer cell into a stalked cell We analyzed the adaptive response of crescentus swarmer cells to carbon starvation and found that there was a block in both the cell polar differentiation program and the initiation of DNA replication SpoT is a bifunctional that controls the level of the nucleotide p ppGpp and carbon starvation caused a increase in p ppGpp concentration Carbon starvation activates DnaA proteolysis Gorbatyuk and Marczynski Mol Microbiol 2005 We observed that SpoT is required for this phenomenon in swarmer cells and in the absence of SpoT swarmer cells inappropriately initiated DNA replication Since SpoT controls p ppGpp abundance we propose that this nucleotide relays carbon starvation signals to the cellular factors responsible for activating DnaA proteolysis thereby inhibiting the initiation of DNA replication SpoT however was not required for the carbon starvation block of the cell polar differentiation program Thus swarmer cells utilize at least two independent signaling pathways to relay carbon starvation signals a pathway mediating the inhibition of DNA replication initiation and a pathway s that blocks morphological differentiation View details for DOI

signals that replicates mRNA and protein concentration patterns and is consistent with observed mutant phenotypes An asynchronous sequential digital circuit model equivalent to the validated

stops and restarts to accommodate nutrient starvation Model checking also showed that mechanisms involving changes in regulatory promoter regions during DNA replication increase the robustness of the

ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA Collier McAdams Shapiro 2007 104 43 Abstract The Caulobacter cell cycle is driven by a cascade of transient regulators starting with the expression of DnaA in G 1 and ending with the expression of the essential CcrM DNA methyltransferase at the completion of DNA replication The timing of DnaA accumulation was found to be regulated by the methylation state of the dnaA promoter which in turn depends on the chromosomal position of dnaA near the origin of replication and restriction of CcrM synthesis to the end of the cell cycle The dnaA gene is preferentially transcribed from a fully methylated promoter DnaA initiates DNA replication and activates the transcription of the next regulator GcrA With the passage of the replication fork the dnaA promoter becomes hemimethylated and DnaA accumulation drops GcrA then activates the transcription of the next regulator CtrA once the replication fork passes through the ctrA P1 promoter generating two hemimethylated copies of ctrA The ctrA gene is preferentially transcribed from a hemimethylated promoter CtrA then activates the transcription of ccrM to bring the newly replicated chromosome to the fully methylated state promoting dnaA transcription and the start of a new cell cycle We show that the timing of CcrM is critical for Caulobacter fitness The sequential changes in

Shapiro 2007 120 20 Abstract Cellular reproduction in all organisms requires temporal and spatial coordination of crucial events notably DNA replication chromosome segregation and cytokinesis Recent studies on the dimorphic bacterium Caulobacter crescentus Caulobacter highlight mechanisms by which positional information is integrated with temporal modes of cell cycle regulation Caulobacter cell division is inherently asymmetric yielding progeny with different fates stalked cells and swarmer cells Cell type determinants in stalked progeny promote entry into S phase whereas swarmer progeny remain in G1 phase Moreover initiation of DNA replication is allowed only once per cell cycle This finite window of opportunity is imposed by coordinating spatially constrained proteolysis of CtrA an inhibitor of DNA replication initiation with forward progression of the cell cycle Positional cues are equally important in coordinating movement of the chromosome with cell division site selection in Caulobacter The chromosome is specifically and dynamically localized over the course of the cell cycle As the duplicated chromosomes are partitioned factors that restrict assembly of the cell division

Abstract RNA tRNA synthetases which catalyze the attachment of the correct amino acid to its corresponding tRNA during translation of the genetic code are proven antimicrobial drug targets We show that the antifungal AN2690 in development for the treatment of onychomycosis inhibits yeast cytoplasmic synthetase by formation of a stable tRNA Leu adduct in the editing site of the enzyme Adduct formation is mediated through the boron atom of AN2690 and the and atoms of adenosine The trapping of tRNA Leu in the editing site prevents catalytic turnover thus inhibiting synthesis of Leu and

organization and segregation in bacteria JOURNAL OF STRUCTURAL BIOLOGY Thanbichler Shapiro 2006 156 2 Abstract In the recent years considerable advances have been made towards understanding the structure and function of the bacterial chromosome A number of different factors appear to cooperate in condensing DNA into a highly dynamic assembly of supercoiled loops Despite this variability in the lower levels of chromatin structure the global arrangement of chromosomal DNA within the cell is surprisingly conserved with loci being arrayed along the cellular long axis in line with their order on the genomic map This conserved pattern is propagated during the course of DNA segregation First after entry into the newly synthesized origin regions are segregated in an active and directed process involving the bacterial actin homolog MreB Subsequent DNA segments then follow by different mechanisms They are separated immediately after release from the replisome and move rapidly to their conserved positions in the incipient daughter cell compartments Partitioning of the bacterial chromosome thus takes place while DNA replication is in progress View details for DOI View details for Web

OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA Kim Gitai Kinkhabwala Shapiro Moerner 2006 103 29 Abstract The actin cytoskeleton represents a key regulator of multiple essential cellular functions in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes In eukaryotes these functions depend on the orchestrated dynamics of actin filament assembly and disassembly However the dynamics of the bacterial actin homolog MreB have yet to be examined in vivo In this study we observed the motion of single fluorescent fluorescent protein fusions in living Caulobacter cells in a background of unlabeled MreB With imaging polymerized MreB filamentous MreB fMreB and unpolymerized MreB globular MreB gMreB monomers could be distinguished gMreB showed fast motion that was characteristic of Brownian diffusion whereas the labeled molecules in fMreB displayed slow directed motion This directional movement of labeled MreB in the growing polymer provides an indication that like actin MreB monomers treadmill through MreB filaments by preferential polymerization at one filament end and depolymerization at the other filament end From these data we extract several characteristics of single MreB filaments including that they are on average much shorter than the cell length and that the direction of their polarized assembly seems to be independent of the overall cellular polarity Thus MreB like actin exhibits treadmilling behavior in vivo and the long MreB structures that have been visualized in multiple bacterial species seem to represent bundles of short filaments that lack a uniform global polarity View

Abstract Temporally and spatially controlled master regulators drive the Caulobacter cell cycle by regulating the expression of 200 genes Rapid clearance of the master regulator CtrA by the ClpXP protease is a critical event that enables the initiation of chromosome replication at specific times in the cell cycle We show here that a previously unidentified single regulator CpdR when in the unphosphorylated state binds to ClpXP and thereby causes its localization to the cell pole We further show that ClpXP localization is required for CtrA proteolysis When CpdR is phosphorylated ClpXP is delocalized and CtrA is not degraded Both CtrA and CpdR are phosphorylated via the same CckA histidine kinase pathway providing a reinforcing mechanism that simultaneously activates CtrA and prevents its degradation by delocalizing the complex In swarmer cells CpdR is in the phosphorylated state thus preventing ClpXP localization and CtrA degradation As swarmer cells differentiate into stalked cells transition unphosphorylated CpdR accumulates and is localized to the stalked cell pole where it enables ClpXP localization and CtrA proteolysis allowing the initiation of DNA replication Dynamic

Thanbichler Shapiro 2006 126 1 Abstract Correct positioning of the division plane is a prerequisite for the generation of daughter cells with a normal chromosome complement Here we present a mechanism that coordinates assembly and placement of the FtsZ cytokinetic ring with bipolar localization of the newly duplicated chromosomal origins in Caulobacter After replication of the polarly located origin region one copy moves rapidly to the opposite end of the cell in an manner A previously uncharacterized essential protein MipZ forms a complex with the partitioning protein ParB near the origin of replication and localizes with the duplicated origin regions to the cell poles MipZ directly interferes with FtsZ polymerization thereby restricting FtsZ ring formation to midcell the region of lowest MipZ concentration The cellular localization of MipZ thus serves the dual function of positioning the FtsZ ring and delaying formation of the cell division apparatus until chromosome

eukaryotes We show here that the ClpXP protease responsible for the degradation of multiple bacterial proteins is dynamically localized to specific cellular positions in Caulobacter where it degrades colocalized proteins The CtrA cell cycle master regulator that must be cleared from the Caulobacter cell to allow the initiation of chromosome replication interacts with the ClpXP protease at the cell pole where it is degraded We have identified a novel conserved protein RcdA that forms a complex with CtrA and ClpX in the cell RcdA is required for CtrA polar localization and degradation by ClpXP The localization pattern of RcdA is coincident with and dependent upon ClpX localization Thus a dynamically localized ClpXP proteolysis complex in concert with a cytoplasmic factor provides temporal

cell division in Caulobacter JOURNAL OF BACTERIOLOGY Wang West Shapiro 2006 188 4 Abstract Bacterial chromosome partitioning and cell division are tightly connected cellular processes We show here that the Caulobacter crescentus FtsK protein localizes to the division plane where it mediates multiple functions involved in chromosome segregation and cytokinesis The first 258 amino acids of the N terminus are necessary and sufficient for targeting the protein to the division plane Furthermore the FtsK N terminus is required to either assemble or maintain FtsZ rings at the division plane The FtsK C terminus is essential in Caulobacter and is involved in maintaining accurate chromosome partitioning In addition the region of FtsK is required for the localization of the topoisomerase IV ParC subunit to the replisome to facilitate chromosomal decatenation prior to cell division These results suggest that the interdependence between chromosome partitioning and cell division in Caulobacter

levels of CtrA and GcrA are temporally and spatially during the cell cycle with CtrA repressing gcrA transcription and GcrA activating ctrA transcription Here we show that DnaA a protein required for the initiation of DNA replication also functions as a transcriptional activator of gcrA which in turn activates multiple genes notably those involved in chromosome replication and segregation The cellular concentration of DnaA is cell peaking at the time of replication initiation and gcrA induction Regulated proteolysis of GcrA contributes to the cell cycle variations in GcrA abundance We propose that DnaA couples DNA replication initiation with the expression of the two oscillating regulators GcrA and CtrA and that the regulatory cascade drives the forward progression of the

organelle biogenesis to the correct cell pole at a defined time in the cell cycle We have identified a periplasmic protease PerP that initiates the proteolytic sequence by truncating PodJ L to a form with altered activity PodJ S Expression of perP is regulated by a signal transduction system that activates cell transcription programs and conversion of PodJ L to PodJ S in response to the completion of cytokinesis PodJ S sequestered to the progeny swarmer cell is subsequently released from the polar membrane by the membrane metalloprotease MmpA for degradation during the cell transition This sequence of proteolytic events contributes to the asymmetric localization of PodJ isoforms to the appropriate cell pole Thus temporal activation of the PerP protease and spatial restriction of the

Shapiro Gitai Z 2005 102 51 Abstract The actin homolog MreB contributes to bacterial cell shape Here we explore the role of the coexpressed MreC protein in Caulobacter and show that it forms a periplasmic spiral that is out of phase with the cytoplasmic MreB spiral Both mreB and mreC are essential and depletion of either protein results in a similar cell shape defect MreB forms dynamic spirals in cells and MreC localizes helically in the presence of the A22 indicating that each protein can form a spiral independently of the other We show that the peptidoglycan transpeptidase Pbp2 also forms a helical pattern that partially colocalizes with MreC but not MreB Perturbing either MreB with A22 or MreC with depletion causes to mislocalize to the division plane indicating that each is necessary but not sufficient to generate a helical Pbp2 pattern We show that it is the division process that draws Pbp2 to midcell in the absence of MreB regulation because cells depleted of the tubulin homolog FtsZ maintain a helical Pbp2 localization in the presence of A22 By developing and employing a previously uncharacterized computational method for quantitating shape variance we find that a FtsZ depletion can also partially rescue the shape deformation We conclude that MreB and MreC form spatially distinct and independently localized spirals and propose that MreB inhibits division plane localization of Pbp2 whereas MreC promotes lengthwise localization of Pbp2 together these two mechanism ensure a helical localization of Pbp2 and thereby the maintenance of proper cell

initiation factor increases during the Caulobacter transition just before the transition We show that DnaA coordinates DNA replication initiation with cell cycle progression by acting as a global transcription factor Using DnaA depletion and induction in synchronized cell populations we have analysed global transcription patterns to identify the differential regulation of normally genes The DnaA regulon includes genes encoding several replisome components the GcrA global cell cycle regulator the PodJ polar localization protein the FtsZ cell division protein and nucleotide biosynthesis enzymes In cells depleted of DnaA the transition is temporally separated from the cell differentiation which is normally coincident In the absence of DnaA the CtrA master regulator is cleared by proteolysis during the cell transition as usual but DNA replication initiation is blocked In this case expression of gcrA which is directly repressed by CtrA does not increase in conjunction with the disappearance of CtrA until DnaA is subsequently induced showing that gcrA expression requires DnaA DnaA boxes are present upstream of many genes whose expression requires DnaA and binds to the promoters of gcrA ftsZ and podJ in vitro This redundant control of gcrA transcription by DnaA activation and CtrA repression forms a robust switch controlling the decision to proceed through the cell

given signal and depending on the organism in which the network module is present transduce this signal to affect different metabolic or developmental pathways Here we report a global transcriptional analysis of an oxygen network in Caulobacter crescentus consisting of the sensor histidine kinase FixL its cognate response regulator FixJ the transcriptional regulator FixK and the kinase inhibitor FixT It is known that in rhizobial bacteria these proteins form a network that regulates transcription of genes required for symbiotic nitrogen fixation anaerobic and microaerobic respiration and hydrogen metabolism under hypoxic conditions We have identified a positive feedback loop in this network and present evidence that the negative feedback regulator FixT acts to inhibit FixL by mimicking a response regulator Overall the core circuit topology of the Fix network is conserved between the rhizobia and crescentus a aerobe that can not fix nitrogen respire anaerobically or metabolize hydrogen In crescentus the Fix network is required for normal cellular growth during hypoxia and controls expression of genes encoding four distinct aerobic respiratory terminal oxidases

several polar organelles including the pili adhesive holdfast and chemotactic apparatus by recruiting structural and regulatory proteins such as CpaE and PleC to a specific cell pole PodJ is a protein with a single transmembrane domain that exists in two forms PodJL and truncated PodJS each appearing during a specific time period of the cell cycle to control different aspects of polar organelle development PodJL is synthesized in the early predivisional cell and is later proteolytically converted to PodJS During the transition PodJS must be degraded to preserve asymmetry in the next cell

over the circular Caulobacter crescentus chromosome and found that in living cells each locus has a specific subcellular address and that these loci are arrayed in linear order along the long axis of the cell microscopy of the location of the chromosomal origin and 10 selected loci in the half of the chromosome showed that during DNA replication as the replisome sequentially copies each locus the newly replicated DNA segments are moved in chronological order to their final subcellular destination in the nascent half of the predivisional cell Thus the remarkable organization of the chromosome is being established while DNA replication is still in progress The fact that the movement of these 10 loci is like that of the origin directed and rapid and occurs at a similar rate suggests that the

topological constraints that are further confounded by simultaneous transcription Topoisomerases play a key role in ensuring orderly replication and partition of DNA in the face of a continuously changing DNA tertiary structure In addition to topological constraints the cellular position of the replication origin is strictly controlled during the cell cycle In Caulobacter crescentus the origin of DNA replication is located at the cell pole Upon initiation of DNA replication one copy of the duplicated origin sequence rapidly appears at the opposite cell pole To determine whether the maintenance of DNA topology contributes to the dynamic positioning of a specific DNA region within the cell we examined origin localization in cells that express forms of either the ParC or ParE subunit of topoisomerase Topo IV We found that in the absence of active Topo IV replication initiation can occur but a significant percent of replication origins are either no longer moved to or maintained at the cell poles During the replication process the ParC subunit colocalizes with the replisome whereas the ParE subunit is dispersed throughout the cell However an active ParE subunit is required for ParC localization to the replisome as it moves from the cell pole to the division plane during chromosome replication We propose that the maintenance of DNA topology throughout the cell

processes The regulatory circuit controls expression of polar differentiation factors and the timing of DNA replication CtrA functions as a silencer of the replication origin and GcrA as an activator of components of the replisome and the segregation machinery View details for DOI View details for Web of Science ID 000221383300040 View details for PubMedID 15087506 Recruitment of a cytoplasmic response regulator to the cell pole is linked to its cell proteolysis PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA Ryan Huntwork Shapiro 2004 101 19 Abstract The response regulator CtrA which silences the Caulobacter origin of replication and controls multiple cell cycle events is specifically proteolyzed in cells preparing to initiate DNA replication At the cell transition and in the stalked compartment of the predivisional cell CtrA is localized to the cell pole just before its degradation Analysis of the requirements for CtrA polar localization and CtrA proteolysis revealed that both processes require a motif within amino acids of the CtrA receiver domain and neither process requires CtrA phosphorylation These results strongly suggest that CtrA polar localization is coupled to its cell proteolysis The polarly localized DivK response regulator promotes CtrA localization and proteolysis but it does not directly recruit CtrA to the cell pole Mutations in the divJ and pleC histidine kinases perturb the characteristic asymmetry of CtrA localization and proteolysis in the predivisional cell We propose that polar recruitment of CtrA evolved to ensure that CtrA is degraded only in the stalked half of the predivisional cell perhaps by localizing a proteolytic adaptor protein to the stalked pole This is an example of controlled proteolysis of a cytoplasmic protein that is associated with its active recruitment to a specific subcellular address View details for DOI View details for PubMedID 15123835 Codon usage between genomes is constrained by mutational processes PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA Chen Lee Hottes Shapiro McAdams 2004 101 10 Abstract Analysis of codon bias shows that only two parameters effectively differentiate the codon bias of 100 eubacterial and archaeal organisms The first parameter correlates with genome GC content and the second parameter correlates with nucleotide bias Both of these parameters may be calculated from intergenic sequences Therefore codon bias in eubacteria and archaea may be predicted from intergenic sequences that are not translated When these two parameters are calculated for genes from nonmammalian eukaryotic organisms genes from the same organism again have similar values and codon bias may also be predicted from intergenic sequences In mammals genes from the same organism are similar only in the second parameter because GC content varies widely among isochores Our results suggest that in general codon bias is determined primarily by mutational processes that act throughout the genome and only secondarily by selective forces acting on translated sequences View details for DOI View details for Web of Science

UNITED STATES OF AMERICA Judd Ryan Moerner Shapiro McAdams 2003 100 14 Abstract Asymmetric cell division in Caulobacter crescentus yields daughter cells that have different cell fates Compartmentalization of the predivisional cell is a critical event in the establishment of the differential distribution of regulatory factors that specify cell fate To determine when during the cell cycle the cytoplasm is compartmentalized so that cytoplasmic proteins can no longer diffuse between the two nascent progeny cell compartments we designed a fluorescence loss in photobleaching assay Individual cells containing enhanced GFP were exposed to a bleaching laser pulse tightly focused at one cell pole In compartmentalized cells fluorescence disappears only in the compartment receiving the bleaching beam in noncompartmentalized cells fluorescence disappears from the entire cell In a cell cycle the cells were compartmentalized 18 5 min before the progeny cells separated Clearance of the 22000 CtrA master transcriptional regulator molecules from the stalked portion of the predivisional cell is a controlling element of Caulobacter asymmetry Monitoring of a fluorescent marker for

distinct protein complexes the flagellum and the pilus biogenesis machinery are asymmetrically assembled at one pole of the Caulobacter predivisional cell Cell division yields dissimilar daughter cells a stalked cell and a swarmer cell that assembles several pili at the flagellated cell pole Strains bearing mutations in the pleA gene are pililess and The PleA protein contains a region that is similar to a active site and a point mutation at this site in PleA results in the loss of flagellum and pili biogenesis PleA was found to be required for the insertion of the outer membrane pilus secretion channel at the cell pole and for the accumulation of the PilA pilin subunit PleA is also required for the assembly of substructures of the flagellar basal body hook complex that are located in or traverse the peptidoglycan layer These results argue that PleA facilitates the assembly of structures at the cell pole In support of this PleA was found to be present only during a short

bacteria We determined the cellular positions of the origins of the replicons in the alpha proteobacteria Agrobacterium tumefaciens and Sinorhizobium meliloti and found that they are located at the

JOURNAL OF BACTERIOLOGY Jensen Shapiro 2003 185 10 Abstract Structural maintenance of chromosomes proteins SMCs bind to DNA and function to ensure proper chromosome organization in both eukaryotes and bacteria Caulobacter crescentus possesses a single SMC homolog that plays a role in organizing and segregating daughter chromosomes Approximately to SMC molecules are present per cell during active growth corresponding to one SMC complex per to bp of chromosomal DNA Although transcription from the smc promoter is induced during early S phase a cell cycle transcription pattern previously observed with multiple DNA replication and repair genes the SMC protein is present throughout the entire cell cycle Examination of the intracellular location of SMC showed that in swarmer cells which do not replicate DNA the protein forms two or three foci Stalked cells which are actively engaged in DNA replication have three or four SMC foci per cell The SMC foci appear randomly distributed in the cell Many predivisional cells have bright polar SMC foci which are lost upon cell division Thus chromosome compaction likely involves dynamic aggregates of SMC bound to DNA The aggregation pattern changes

abundance of SsrA RNA in Caulobacter crescentus is regulated with respect to the cell cycle SsrA RNA abundance increases in late G 1 phase peaks during the G 1 transition and declines in early S phase in keeping with the reported role for SsrA in the timing of DNA replication initiation Cell cycle regulation of SsrA RNA is accomplished by a combination of temporally controlled transcription and regulated RNA degradation Transcription from the ssrA promoter peaks late in G 1 just before the peak in SsrA RNA abundance SsrA RNA is stable in G 1 cells and late cells but is degraded with a of 4 to 5 min at the onset of S phase This degradation is surprising since SsrA RNA is both highly structured and highly abundant This is the first observation of a structural RNA that is cell cycle

cell cycle progression and polar morphogenesis Because of its critical role CtrA activity is temporally regulated by multiple mechanisms including phosphorylation and degradation of CtrA The CckA histidine kinase is known to contribute to CtrA phosphorylation We show here that genes differentially expressed in a ctrA ts mutant are similarly affected in a cckA ts mutant that the phosphorylation of CckA coincides temporally with CtrA phosphorylation during the cell cycle and that CckA is essential for viability because it is required for CtrA phosphorylation Thus it is the signal transduction pathway mediated by CckA that culminates in CtrA activation which is temporally regulated and essential for cell cycle progression CckA also positively regulates CtrA activity by a mechanism that is independent of CtrA phosphorylation CtrA is more stable in the presence of CckA than it is absence suggesting that CckA may also be involved directly or indirectly in the regulation of CtrA

Shapiro 2003 185 2 Abstract SsrA or tmRNA is a small RNA that interacts with selected translating ribosomes to target the nascent polypeptides for degradation Here we report that SsrA activity is required for normal timing of the G 1 transition in Caulobacter crescentus A deletion of the ssrA gene or of the gene encoding SmpB a protein required for SsrA activity results in a specific delay in the cell cycle during the G 1 transition The ssrA deletion phenotype is not due to accumulation of stalled ribosomes because the deletion is not complemented by a mutated version of SsrA that releases ribosomes but does not target proteins for degradation Degradation of the CtrA response regulator normally coincides with initiation of DNA replication but in strains lacking SsrA activity there is a delay between the degradation of CtrA and replication initiation This uncoupling of initiation of replication from CtrA degradation indicates that there is an pathway required for correct timing of

in bacteria SCIENCE Shapiro McAdams Losick 2002 298 5600 Abstract Bacteria are often highly polarized exhibiting specialized structures at or near the ends of the cell Among such structures are centers which mediate the movement of certain pathogenic bacteria within the cytoplasm of an animal host cell organized arrays of membrane receptors which govern chemosensory behavior in swimming bacteria and asymmetrically positioned septa which generate specialized progeny in differentiating bacteria This polarization is orchestrated by complex and dynamic changes in the subcellular localization of signal transduction and cytoskeleton proteins as well as of specific regions of the chromosome Recent work has provided information on how dynamic subcellular localization occurs and how it is exploited by the bacterial cell The main task of a bacterial cell is to survive and duplicate itself The bacterium must replicate its genetic material and divide at the correct site in the cell and at the correct time in the cell cycle with high precision Each kind of bacterium also executes its own strategy to find nutrients in its habitat and to cope with conditions of stress from its environment This involves moving toward food adapting to environmental extremes and in many cases entering and exploiting a eukaryotic host These activities often involve processes that take place at or near the poles of the cell Here we explore some of the schemes bacteria use to orchestrate dynamic changes at their poles and how these polar events execute cellular functions In spite of their small size bacteria have a remarkably complex internal organization and external architecture Bacterial cells are inherently asymmetric some more obviously so than others The most easily recognized asymmetries involve surface structures flagella pili and stalks that are preferentially assembled at one pole by many bacteria New poles generated at the cell division plane differ from old poles from the previous round of cell division Even in Escherichia coli which is generally thought to be symmetrical old poles are more static than new poles with respect to cell wall assembly 1 and they differ in the deposition of phospholipid domains 2 There are many instances of differential polar functions among these is the preferential use of old poles when attaching to host cells as in the interaction of Bradyrhizobium with plant root hairs 3 or the polar attachment of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa pathogen to tracheal epithelia 4 An unusual polar organelle that mediates directed motility on solid surfaces is found in the nonpathogenic bacterium Myxococcus xanthus The gliding motility of this bacterium is propelled by a structure that squirts a slime from the pole of the cell 5 Interestingly

MOLECULAR BIOLOGY Ryan Judd Shapiro 2002 324 3 Abstract The signaling protein CtrA activates or represses the expression of of the genes in Caulobacter crescentus integrating DNA replication morphogenesis and cell division The activity of this essential protein is controlled by a positive transcriptional feedback loop phosphorylation and rapid proteolysis as cells enter at the cell transition and in the stalked portion of the asymmetric predivisional cell CtrA activity must be removed from cells at the onset of DNA replication because phosphorylated CtrA binds to and silences the origin of replication The ClpXP protease is required for CtrA proteolysis but is present throughout the so the mechanism for activating and deactivating CtrA proteolysis is unknown Here we identify a bipartite proteolytic signal in the CtrA response regulator consisting of two determinants that are each necessary but not sufficient for regulated degradation One determinant is present in the last 15 amino acid residues of CtrA particularly the terminal residues and another is located within the first 56 residues of the CtrA receiver domain A fusion of the receiver domain and last 15 residues of CtrA to YFP is properly degraded in living cells Although the 56 residues contain the conserved Asp51 phosphorylation site mutant analyses show that CtrA proteolysis is insensitive to the

chromosome changes progressively from the fully methylated to the hemimethylated state during DNA replication These changes in DNA methylation could signal differential binding of regulatory proteins to activate or repress transcription The gene encoding CtrA a key cell cycle regulatory protein is transcribed from two promoters The P1 promoter fires early in S phase and contains a GAnTC sequence that is recognized by the CcrM DNA methyltransferase Using analysis of CcrM mutant strains transcriptional reporters integrated at different sites on the chromosome and a ctrA P1 mutant we demonstrate that transcription of the P1 promoter is repressed by DNA methylation Moreover moving the native ctrA gene to a position near the chromosomal terminus which delays the conversion of the ctrA promoter from the fully to the hemimethylated state until late in the cell cycle inhibited ctrA P1 transcription and altered the time of accumulation of the CtrA protein and the size distribution of swarmer

signal transduction response regulator controls morphogenesis during the Caulobacter cell cycle PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA Jacobs Hung Shapiro 2001 98 7 Abstract We present evidence that a bacterial signal transduction cascade that couples morphogenesis with cell cycle progression is regulated by dynamic localization of its components Previous studies have implicated two histidine kinases DivJ and PleC and the response regulator DivK in the regulation of morphogenesis in the dimorphic bacterium Caulobacter crescentus Here we show that the cytoplasmic response regulator DivK exhibits a dynamic cyclical localization that culminates in asymmetric distribution of DivK within the two cell types that are characteristic of the Caulobacter cell cycle DivK is dispersed throughout the cytoplasm of the progeny swarmer cell and is localized to the pole of the stalked cell The DivJ and PleC histidine kinases which are asymmetrically localized at the opposite poles of the predivisional cell control the temporal and spatial localization of DivK DivJ mediates DivK targeting to the poles whereas PleC controls its release from one of the poles at times and places that are consistent with the activities and location of DivJ and PleC in the late predivisional cell Thus dynamic changes in subcellular location of multiple components of a signal transduction cascade may constitute a novel mode of prokaryotic regulation to generate and maintain cellular asymmetry View details for Web of Science ID 000167833700088 View details for

stalled ribosomes and to clear the cell of incomplete polypeptides involves an RNA species tmRNA SsrA which functions as both a tRNA and an mRNA This RNA encodes a peptide tag that is incorporated at the end of the aberrant polypeptide and targets it for proteolysis We have identified a circularly permuted version of the tmRNA gene in as well as in a lineage of cyanobacteria The genes in these two groups seem to have arisen from two independent permutation events As a result of the altered genetic structure these tmRNAs are composed of two distinct RNA molecules The mature tmRNAs are predicted to have a domain and an domain similar to those of standard tmRNAs with a break located in the loop containing the tag reading frame A related sequence was found in the mitochondrial genome of Reclinomonas americana but only the portion is retained Although several sequence and structural motifs that are conserved among tmRNAs have been lost the Caulobacter crescentus produces a functional

the sequence GAnTC Like Dam in the enterobacteria CcrM plays a regulatory role in Caulobacter crescentus and Rhizobium meliloti CcrM is essential for viability in both of these organisms and we show here that it is also essential in Brucella abortus Further increased copy number of the ccrM gene results in striking changes in abortus morphology DNA replication and growth in murine macrophages We generated strains that carry ccrM either on a plasmid strain GR131 or on a plasmid strain GR132 Strain GR131 has morphology and chromosome number as assessed by flow cytometry In contrast strain GR132 has abnormal branched morphology suggesting aberrant cell division and increased chromosome number Although these strains exhibit different morphologies and DNA content the replication of both strains in macrophages is attenuated These data imply that the reduction in survival in host cells is not due solely to a cell division defect but is due to additional functions of CcrM Because CcrM is essential in abortus and increased ccrM copy number attenuates survival in host cells we propose that CcrM is an appropriate target for new antibiotics View details for Web of Science ID

MOLECULAR CELL Wheeler Shapiro 1999 4 5 Abstract The bacterium crescentus coordinates cellular differentiation and cell cycle progression via a network of signal transduction proteins Here we demonstrate that the antagonistic DivJ and PleC histidine kinases that regulate polar differentiation are differentially localized as a function of the cell cycle The DivJ kinase localizes to the stalked pole in response to a signal at the transition while the PleC kinase is localized to the flagellar pole in swarmer and predivisional cells but is dispersed throughout the cell in the stalked cell PleC which is required for DivJ localization may provide the cue at the transition that directs the polar positioning of DivJ The dynamic positioning of signal transduction proteins may

19 Abstract The highly conserved SMC Structural Maintenance of Chromosomes proteins function in chromosome condensation segregation and other aspects of chromosome dynamics in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes A null mutation in the Caulobacter crescentus smc gene is conditionally lethal and causes a cell cycle arrest at the predivisional cell stage Chromosome segregation in and smc null mutant cells was examined by monitoring the intracellular localization of the replication origin and terminus by using fluorescence in situ hybridization In cells the origin is located at the flagellated pole of swarmer cells and immediately after the initiation of DNA replication in stalked cells one of the origins moves to the opposite pole giving a bipolar localization of the origins The terminus moves from the end of the swarmer cell opposite the origin to midcell A subpopulation of the smc null mutant cells had mislocalized origins or termini showing that the smc null mutation gives DNA segregation defects Nucleoid morphology was also abnormal Thus we propose that the Caulobacter chromosomal origins have specific cellular addresses and that the SMC protein plays important roles in maintaining chromosome structure and in partitioning The specific cell cycle arrest in the smc null mutant indicates the presence of a cell cycle checkpoint that senses perturbations in chromosome

Domian Reisenauer Shapiro 1999 96 12 Abstract The transcriptional regulator CtrA controls several key events in Caulobacter crescentus including the initiation of DNA replication DNA methylation cell division and flagellar biogenesis CtrA is a member of the response regulator family of two component signal transduction systems Caulobacter goes to great lengths to control the time and place of the activity of this critical regulatory factor during the cell cycle These controls include temporally regulated transcription and phosphorylation and spatially restricted proteolysis We report here that ctrA expression is under the control of two promoters a promoter P1 that is active only in the early predivisional cell and a stronger promoter P2 that is active in the late predivisional cell Both promoters exhibit feedback regulation the early P1 promoter is negatively controlled by CtrA and the late P2 promoter is under positive feedback control The CtrA protein footprints conserved binding sites within the P1 and P2 promoters We propose that the P1 promoter is activated after the initiation of DNA replication in the early predivisional cell The ensuing accumulation of CtrA results in the activation of the P2 promoter and the repression of the P1 promoter late in the cell cycle Thus two transcriptional feedback loops coupled to cell proteolysis and phosphorylation of the CtrA

different phases of the cell cycle Here we identify an essential histidine kinase CckA that is responsible for CtrA activation by phosphorylation Although CckA is present throughout the cell cycle it moves to a cell pole in S phase and upon cell division it disperses Removal of the region of CckA results in loss of polar localization and cell death We propose that polar CckA functions to activate

diverse group of genes at different times in the Caulobacter crescentus cell cycle To understand the differential regulation of genes we compared the expression of two of these genes the fliQ flagellar gene and the ccrM DNA methyltransferase gene Despite their similar promoter architecture these genes are transcribed at different times in the cell cycle PfliQ is activated earlier than PccrM Phosphorylated CtrA CtrA approximately P bound to the CtrA recognition sequence in both promoters but had a to greater affinity for PfliQ This difference in affinity correlates with temporal changes in the cellular levels of CtrA Disrupting a unique inverted repeat element in PccrM significantly reduced promoter activity but not the timing of transcription initiation suggesting that the inverted repeat does not play a major role in the temporal control of ccrM expression Our data indicate that differences in the affinity of CtrA approximately P for PfliQ and PccrM regulate in part the temporal expression of these genes However the timing of fliQ transcription but not of ccrM transcription was altered in cells expressing a stable CtrA derivative indicating that changes in CtrA approximately P levels alone can not govern the cell cycle transcription of these genes We propose that changes in the cellular concentration of CtrA approximately P and its interaction with accessory proteins influence the temporal expression of fliQ ccrM and other key cell cycle genes and ultimately the regulation of the cell cycle View details for Web of Science ID 000079706600016 View details

part through the organization of the flagellar structural genes in a regulatory hierarchy of four classes Class II genes are the earliest to be expressed and are activated at a specific time in the cell cycle by the CtrA response regulator In order to identify gene products required for early events in flagellar assembly we used the known phenotypes of class II mutants to identify new class II flagellar genes In this report we describe the isolation and characterization of a flagellar gene fliX A fliX null mutant is nonmotile lacks a flagellum and exhibits a marked cell division defect Epistasis experiments placed fliX within class II of the flagellar regulatory hierarchy suggesting that FliX functions at an early stage in flagellar assembly The fliX gene encodes a protein with a putative signal sequence Expression of fliX is under cell cycle control with transcription beginning relatively early in the cell cycle and peaking in Caulobacter predivisional cells Full expression of fliX was found to be dependent on ctrA and DNase I footprinting analysis demonstrated a direct interaction between CtrA and the fliX promoter The fliX gene is located upstream and is divergently transcribed from the class III flagellar gene flgI which encodes the basal body monomer Analysis of the intergenic region revealed an arrangement of elements similar to that of another set of Caulobacter class II and class III flagellar genes that is also divergently transcribed In parallel with the FliL protein FliX copurifies with the membrane fraction and although its expression is cell

adenine DNA methyltransferase from Caulobacter crescentus processively methylates GANTC sites on hemimethylated DNA PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA Berdis Lee Coward Stephens Wright Shapiro Benkovic J 1998 95 6 Abstract The kinetic properties of an adenine DNA methyltransferase involved in cell cycle regulation of Caulobacter crescentus have been elucidated by using defined unmethylated or hemimethylated DNA DNAHM substrates Catalytic efficiency is significantly enhanced with a DNAHM substrate Biphasic kinetic behavior during methyl incorporation is observed when unmethylated or DNAHM substrates are used indicating that a step after chemistry limits enzyme turnover and is most likely the release of enzyme from methylated DNA product The enzyme is thermally inactivated at 30 degrees C within 20 min this process is substantially decreased in the presence of saturating concentrations of DNAHM suggesting that the enzyme preferentially binds DNA before The activity of the enzyme shows an unusual sensitivity to salt levels apparently dissociating more rapidly from methylated DNA product as the salt level is decreased The enzyme acts processively during methylation of specific DNA sequences indicating a preferred order of product release in which is released from enzyme before fully methylated DNA The kinetic behavior and activity of the enzyme are consistent with the temporal constraints during the cell methylation of newly replicated chromosomal DNA View details for Web of Science ID 000072596200032 View

types at each cell division a stalked cell competent for DNA replication and a swarmer cell that is unable to initiate DNA replication until it differentiates into a stalked cell later in the cell cycle The CtrA protein a member of the response regulator family of the signal transduction system controls multiple cell cycle processes in Caulobacter and is present in swarmer cells but absent from stalked cells We report that CtrA binds five sites within the chromosome replication origin in vitro These sites overlap an essential DnaA box and a promoter in the origin that is essential for replication initiation Analysis of mutant alleles of ctrA and point mutations in one of the CtrA binding sites in the origin demonstrate that CtrA represses replication in vivo repression at the origin thus restricts replication to the stalked cell type Thus the direct coupling of chromosome replication with the cell cycle is mediated by the ubiquitous signaling proteins View details for Web

defects in Caulobacter crescentus The ffs gene is transcribed throughout the and is transcribed at similar rates in mutant ffs36 and strains but in the mutant the S RNA is unstable leading to lower S RNA levels The ffs36 phenotype results from a single base change in one of the stems of the mature RNA and is completely rescued by a compensating mutation in the opposite strand providing confirmation of the predicted secondary structure of the S RNA The Caulobacter ffs gene was shown to be functionally comparable to the Escherichia coli ffs gene by complementation Comparison of the ffs36 strain to a ts secA strain of Caulobacter also having and DNA replication phenotypes showed that both exhibit a permanent induction of a heat shock response at the restrictive temperature To

methylates the adenine residue in the sequence GANTC The CcrM DNA methyltransferase is essential for viability but it does not appear to be part of a DNA system CcrM homologs are widespread in the alpha subdivision of bacteria We have amplified and sequenced a region of the cerM gene from several of these bacteria including Rhizobium meliloti Brucella abortus Agrobacterium tumefaciens and Rhodobacter capsulatus Alignment of the deduced amino acid sequences revealed that these proteins constitute a highly conserved DNA methyltransferase family Isolation of the ccrM genes from the aquatic bacterium crescentus the soil bacterium meliloti and the intracellular pathogen abortus showed that this sequence conservation extends over the entire protein In at least two alpha subdivision bacteria meliloti and crescentus methylation has important cellular functions In both organisms CcrM is essential for viability Overexpression of CcrM in either bacterium results in defects in cell division and cell morphology and in the initiation of DNA replication Finally the crescentus and meliloti ccrM genes are functionally interchangeable as the complemented strains are viable and the

virtue of a polar flagellum assembled during the predivisional stage of the cell cycle Three mutant strains in which flagellar assembly was blocked at an early stage were isolated The mutations in

FliI protein an ATPase thought to energize the export of flagellar subunits across the cytoplasmic membrane through a type III protein secretion system fliJ encodes a hydrophilic protein of unknown function Epistasis experiments demonstrated that the fliIJ operon is located in class II of the crescentus flagellar regulatory hierarchy suggesting that the gene products act at an early stage in flagellar assembly The expression of fliIJ is induced midway through the cell cycle coincident with other class II operons but the FliI protein remains present throughout the cell cycle Subcellular

gamma and tau subunits of the DNA polymerase III holoenzyme is subject to cell cycle control We present evidence that the first amino acid in the predicted DnaX protein corresponds to the first codon in the mRNA transcribed from the dnaX promoter thus the ribosome must recognize the mRNA at a site downstream of the start codon in an unusual but not unprecedented fashion Inserting four bases in front of the AUG at the 5 end of dnaX mRNA abolishes translation in the correct frame The sequence upstream of the translational start site shows little homology to the canonical ribosome recognition sequence but the region downstream of the start codon is complementary to a region of 16S rRNA implicated in downstream box recognition The region downstream of the dnaX AUG which is important for efficient translation exhibits homology with the corresponding region from the Caulobacter hemE gene adjacent to the replication origin The hemE gene also appears to be translated from a leaderless mRNA Additionally as was found for hemE an upstream untranslated mRNA also extends into the dnaX coding sequence We propose that translation of leaderless mRNAs may provide a mechanism by which the

other two are induced at the transition from swarmer to stalked cell coincident with the initiation of DNA replication The single gyrB promoter is induced at the same time point in the cell cycle

in Escherichia coli encodes both the gamma and tau subunits of the DNA polymerase III holoenzyme identified the dnaX transcription start site and showed that activity from the dnaX promoter is stimulated fourfold at the onset of DNA replication We have identified a conserved sequence motif that is present in the promoter of dnaX and several other genes involved in the replication of DNA all of which show an induction of transcription at the onset of chromosome replication Independent mutations in the conserved sequence that lies between the and regions increased transcription suggesting that a repressor may bind at this site We propose that the coincident transcriptional activation of several dna genes at the swarmer to stalked cell transition occurs in response to cell cycle

GENES DEVELOPMENT Wright Stephens Zweiger Shapiro Alley 1996 10 12 Abstract CcrM an adenine DNA methyltransferase is essential for viability in Caulobacter crescentus The CcrM protein is present only in the predivisional stage of the cell cycle resulting in variation of the DNA methylation state of the chromosome The availability of CcrM is controlled in two ways 1 the ccrM gene is transcribed only in the predivisional cell and 2 the CcrM protein is rapidly degraded prior to cell division We demonstrate here that CcrM is an important target of the Lon protease pathway in crescentus In a lon null mutant ccrM transcription is still temporally regulated but the CcrM protein is present throughout the cell cycle because of a dramatic increase in its stability that results in a fully methylated chromosome throughout the cell cycle Because the Lon protease is present throughout the cell cycle it is likely that the level of CcrM in the cell is controlled by a dynamic balance between temporally varied transcription and constitutive degradation We have shown previously that restriction of CcrM to the crescentus predivisional cell is essential for normal morphogenesis and progression through the cell cycle Comparison of the lon null mutant strain with a strain whose DNA remains fully methylated as a result of constitutive expression of ccrM suggests that the effect of Lon on DNA methylation contributes to several developmental defects observed in the lon mutant These defects include a frequent failure to complete cell division and loss of precise control of initiation of DNA replication Other developmental abnormalities exhibited by the lon null mutant such as the formation of abnormally long stalks appear to be unrelated to altered chromosome methylation state The Lon protease thus exhibits pleiotropic effects in crescentus growth and development View details for Web of Science ID A1996UU11700009 View details for PubMedID 8666236 Cell proteolysis of a flagellar motor protein that is asymmetrically distributed in the Caulobacter predivisional cell EMBO JOURNAL Jenal Shapiro 1996 15 10 Abstract Flagellar biogenesis and release are developmental events tightly coupled to the cell cycle of Caulobacter crescentus A single flagellum is assembled at the swarmer pole of the predivisional cell and is released later in the cell cycle Here we show that the monomer FliF a central motor component that anchors the flagellum in the cell membrane is synthesized only in the predivisional cell and is integrated into the membrane at the incipient swarmer cell pole where it initiates flagellar assembly FliF is proteolytically turned over during cell differentiation coinciding with the loss of the flagellum suggesting that its degradation is coupled to flagellar release The membrane topology of FliF was determined and a region of the cytoplasmic domain was shown to be required for the interaction with a component of the motor switch The very end of FliF contains a turnover determinant required for the cell degradation of the The cell proteolysis of FliF and the targeting of FliF to the swarmer pole together

network that functions to control the transcription of the heat shock genes in bacteria includes unique structural motifs in the promoter region of these genes and the expression of alternate sigma factors One of the conserved structural motifs the inverted repeat CIRCE element is found in the 5 region of many heat shock operons including the Caulobacter crescentus groESL operon We report the identification of another crescentus heat shock operon containing two genes hrcA hrc for heat shock regulation at CIRCE elements and a grpE homolog Disruption of the hrcA gene homologs of which are also found upstream of grpE in other bacteria increased transcription of the groESL operon and this effect was dependent on the presence of an intact CIRCE element This suggests a role for HrcA in negative regulation of heat shock gene expression We identified a major promoter transcribing both hrcA and grpE and a minor promoter located within the hrcA coding sequence just upstream of grpE Both promoters were heat shock inducible with maximal expression 10 to 20 min after heat shock Both promoters were also expressed constitutively throughout the cell cycle under physiological conditions

regulated both temporally during the normal cell cycle and by heat shock Analysis of deletions and base substitutions in the 5 region of the operon established the presence of two functional promoters a heat promoter P1 with characteristics of a sigma 32 promoter and an adjacent sigma promoter P2 Transcription initiating at the sigma promoter is under strict temporal control whereas transcription initiating at the heat shock promoter at 30 degrees C is not Transcription of dnaKJ occurs during a short period in the cell cycle concomitant with the onset of DNA replication Deletions in the 5 region have also revealed that all sites required for temporal control of transcription reside within 50 bases of the P2 start site Transcripts initiating from either the P1 or the P2 promoter have an RNA leader sequence with a high probability of forming an extensive secondary structure Deletion of this leader sequence resulted in an increased rate of expression in both transcriptional and

differentiation is an inherent component of the Caulobacter crescentus cell cycle The transition of a swarmer cell with a single polar flagellum into a sessile stalked cell includes several morphogenetic events These include the release of the flagellum and pili the proteolysis of chemotaxis proteins the biogenesis of the polar stalk and the initiation of DNA replication We have isolated a group of mutants that are unable to complete this process at the restrictive temperature We show here that one of these strains has a mutation in a homolog of the Escherichia coli secA gene whose product is involved in protein translocation at the cell membrane This crescentus secA mutant has allowed the identification of morphogenetic events in the cell transition that require protein translocation Upon shift to the nonpermissive temperature the mutant secA swarmer cell is able to release the polar flagellum degrade chemoreceptors and initiate DNA replication but it is unable to form a stalk complete DNA replication or carry out cell division At the nonpermissive temperature the cell cycle blocks prior to the de novo synthesis of flagella and chemotaxis proteins that normally occurs in the predivisional cell Although interactions between the chromosome and the cytoplasmic membrane are believed to be a functional component of the temporal regulation of DNA replication the ability of this secA mutant to initiate replication at the nonpermissive temperature suggests that events are not involved in this process However both cell division and stalk formation which is

Abstract Caulobacter crescentus was found to have a DNA methyltransferase CcrM that methylates the adenine base of the HinfI recognition sequence GANTC The ccrM gene was cloned and DNA sequence analysis revealed that the predicted amino acid sequence has 49 identity with the Haemophilus influenzae methyltransferase HinfM Expression of the ccrM gene was found to be restricted to the portion of the cell cycle immediately prior to cell division At three separate chromosomal sites the CcrM recognition sequence is fully methylated in swarmer cells becomes hemimethylated upon DNA replication in stalked cells and does not become remethylated until just prior to cell division The time of methyltransferase expression coincides with the time of methylation of these three chromosomal sites and of plasmid DNA in the predivisional cell When ccrM gene expression is placed under control of a constitutive promoter these chromosomal sites are fully methylated throughout the cell cycle A high proportion of morphologically aberrant cells and cells that have undergone an additional chromosome replication initiation are found in this population Thus the temporal control of this

Alley Shapiro 1993 175 22 Abstract The recognition of polar bacterial organization is just emerging The examples of polar localization given here are from a variety of bacterial species and concern a disparate array of cellular functions A number of instances of polar localization of bacterial proteins including the chemoreceptor complex in both crescentus and coli the protein in coli the japonicum surface attachment proteins and the actin tail of monocytogenes within a mammalian cell involve proteins or protein complexes that facilitate bacterial interaction with the environment either the extracellular milieux or that within a plant or mammalian host The significance of this observation remains unclear Polarity in bacteria poses many problems including the necessity for a mechanism for asymmetrically distributing proteins as well as a mechanism by which polar localization is maintained Large structures such as a flagellum are anchored at the pole by means of the basal body that traverses the peptidoglycan wall But for proteins and small complexes whether in the periplasm or the membrane one must invoke a mechanism that prevents the diffusion of these proteins away from the cell pole Perhaps the periplasmic proteins are retained at the pole by the presence of the periseptal annulus 35 The constraining features for membrane components are not known For large aggregates such as the clusters of MCP CheA and CheW complexes perhaps the size of the aggregate alone prevents displacement In most cases of cellular asymmetry bacteria are able to discriminate between the new pole and the old pole and to utilize this information for localization specificity The maturation of new pole to old pole appears to be a common theme as well Given numerous examples

Caulobacter crescentus undergoes an asymmetric cell division resulting in the formation of two different daughter cells a motile swarmer cell and a nonmotile stalked cell These two cell types differ in their program of gene expression their ability to replicate DNA and the physical properties of their nucleoids We show here that two genes gyrB encoding the gyrase B subunit and are specifically transcribed from the chromosome in the portion of the predivisional cell destined for the progeny stalked cell This is in contrast to a subset of flagellar genes which are transcribed from the chromosome in the incipient swarmer portion of the predivisional cell gyrB and are within a newly identified cluster of genes involved in DNA replication and recombination including dnaN and recF The transcription of gyrB and orf1 occurs from the chromosome in stalked and predivisional cells and is silenced in swarmer cells We hypothesize that selective silencing of groups of genes in the chromosomes at the swarmer and stalked poles of the predivisional cell results in the different developmental programs and the difference in replicative ability of the two progeny cells View details

distribution of the membrane chemoreceptors and associated cytoplasmic chemotaxis proteins in Escherichia coli were examined as a prototypic functional aggregate in bacterial cells Bacterial chemotaxis involves a system brought about by ligand association with a membrane receptor culminating in a switch in the direction of flagellar rotation The transduction of the chemotaxis signal is

EXPRESSION OF CAULOBACTER GENES ENCODING FLAGELLAR BASAL BODY ROD AND RING PROTEINS JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR BIOLOGY Dingwall Garman Shapiro 1992 228 4 Abstract The biogenesis of the polar flagellum in Caulobacter crescentus is limited to a specific time in the cell cycle and to a specific site on the cell The basal body is the first part of the flagellum to be assembled In this report we identify a cluster of genes encoding basal body components and describe their transcriptional regulation The genes in this cluster form an operon whose expression is controlled temporally The first two genes encode homologs of FlgF and FlgG which are the proximal and distal rod proteins respectively The sequences of the N and C termini of the Salmonella typhimurium flagellar axial proteins rod hook and known to be highly conserved share a high degree of sequence identity with the FlgF and FlgG rod proteins of the distantly related crescentus Two additional genes in the flgF flgG operon flaD and flgH both encode proteins with potentially cleavable signal sequences The flgH gene encoding the protein is also transcribed from an internal promoter Transcription from the flgF promoter initiates prior to initiation at the internal flgH promoter The internal promoter and its activator site reside within the coding sequence of the upstream flaD gene This type of gene overlap is also observed in bacterial genes involved in cell division Flagellum biogenesis like cell division is a morphogenic event that requires the orderly assembly of component proteins and the overlapping gene organization may affect this ordering of assembly The promoters for the flgF operon and the flgH gene use sigma 54 to initiate transcription The use of sigma 54 promoters known to require cognate binding proteins could allow the that provides the temporal ordering of flagellar gene transcription In this context we have found that the flgF operon and the distal flgI gene encoding the share a sigma 54 activator sequence class IIA that differs from the flgH gene sigma 54 activator site class IIB and the hook cluster class IIC sigma 54 activator site The sequential activation of these three subgroups of structural genes reflects the order of assembly of their gene products into the flagellum View details for Web of Science ID A1992KE60200013 View details for PubMedID 1474584 A TEMPORALLY CONTROLLED IS REQUIRED FOR POLAR MORPHOGENESIS AND DIVISION IN CAULOBACTER GENES DEVELOPMENT Brun Shapiro 1992 6 12A Abstract The transcription of many spatially and temporally controlled flagellar structural genes in Caulobacter requires the RNA polymerase sigma 54 subunit Like flagellar biogenesis stalk formation is an asymmetric polar morphogenesis that occurs once each cell cycle in response to internal cell cycle signals We have isolated the sigma 54 gene rpoN and describe here a novel role for this alternative in cell differentiation It is required for the biogenesis of both polar structures and the disruption of the rpoN gene results in aberrant cell division Surprisingly the transcription of rpoN is temporally regulated during the cell cycle it increases commensurate with stalk formation and just before the onset of flagellar gene expression These results suggest that sigma 54 abundance responds to cell cycle cues and is involved in the global timing of the central events of Caulobacter development whereas the transcriptional activators of sigma promoters are responsible for the refined control of the expression of individual or small groups of genes required for each specific event View details for Web of Science ID A1992KB97700015 View details for PubMedID 1459461 CONTROL OF A CLONED CHROMOSOMAL ORIGIN OF REPLICATION FROM JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR BIOLOGY Marczynski Shapiro 1992 226 4 Abstract Caulobacter crescentus cell division is asymmetric and yields distinct swarmer cell and stalked cell progeny Only the stalked cell initiates chromosomal replication and the swarmer cell must differentiate into a stalked cell before chromosomal DNA replication can occur In an effort to understand this developmental control of replication we employed gel electrophoresis to localize and to isolate the chromosomal origin of replication The crescentus homologues of several Escherichia coli genes are adjacent to the origin in the physical order hemE origin dnaA and dnaK J Deletion analysis reveals that the minimal sequence requirement for autonomous replication is greater than 430 but less than 720 A plasmid whose replication relies only on DNA from the crescentus origin of replication has a distinct temporal pattern of DNA synthesis that resembles that of the bona fide crescentus chromosome This implies that replication control elements are closely linked to this origin of replication This DNA contains sequence motifs that are common to other bacterial origins such as five DnaA boxes an and an exceptional A region Point mutations in one of the DnaA boxes abolish replication in crescentus This origin also possesses three additional motifs that are unique to the crescentus origin of replication seven GGCCTTCC motifs nine AAGCCCGG motifs and five motifs are present The latter two motifs are implicated in essential crescentus replication functions because they are contained within specific deletions that abolish replication View

CELL Gober Shapiro 1992 3 8 Abstract The transcription of a group of flagellar genes is temporally and spatially regulated during the Caulobacter crescentus cell cycle These genes all share the same 5 elements a sigma 54 promoter a binding site for integration host factor IHF and an enhancer sequence known as the ftr element We have partially purified the proteins and we show that they require the same enhancer sequences for binding as are required for transcriptional activation We have also partially purified the Caulobacter homolog of IHF and demonstrate that it can facilitate in vitro lambda recombination Using mutagenesis we provide the first demonstration that natural enhancer sequences and IHF binding elements that reside 3 to the sigma 54 promoter of a bacterial gene flaNQ are required for transcription of the operon in vivo The IHF protein and the protein is primarily restricted to the predivisional cell the cell type in which these promoters are transcribed flaNQ promoter expression is localized to the swarmer pole of the predivisional cell as are other flagellar promoters that possess these regulatory sequences 5 to the start site The requirement for an IHF binding

MCP is an integral membrane receptor protein The chemoreceptor is localized at the pole of Caulobacter crescentus swarmer cells sequences of the MCP target the protein to the membrane while the portion of the protein is responsible for polar localization The crescentus and Escherichia coli MCPs have highly conserved domains and when an coli MCP is expressed in crescentus it is targeted to the swarmer cell progeny These results suggest that subcellular localization of a prokaryotic protein involves interaction of specific regions of the protein with unique cell sites that contain either

AND DIVISION JOURNAL OF BACTERIOLOGY Yu Shapiro 1992 174 10 Abstract The biogenesis of the Caulobacter crescentus polar flagellum requires the expression of more than 48 genes which are organized in a regulatory hierarchy The flbO locus is near the top of the hierarchy and consequently strains with mutations in this locus are nonmotile and lack the flagellar basal body complex In addition to the motility phenotype mutations in this locus also cause abnormal cell division Complementing clones restore both motility and normal cell division Sequence analysis of a complementing subclone revealed that this locus encodes at least two proteins that are homologs of the Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli flagellar proteins FliL and FliM FliM is thought to be a switch protein and to interface with the flagellum motor The crescentus fliL and fliM genes form an operon that is expressed early in the cell cycle Tn5 insertions in the fliM gene prevent the transcription of class II and class III flagellar genes which are lower in the regulatory hierarchy The start site of the fliLM operon lies 166 bp from the divergently transcribed flaCBD operon that encodes several basal body genes Sequence comparison of the fliL transcription start site with those of other class I genes flaS and flaO revealed a highly conserved sequence in a potential promoter region that differs from sigma 70 sigma 54 sigma 32 and sigma 28 promoter sequences suggesting that at least three class I genes share a unique 5 regulatory region View details for Web of Science ID A1992HU93800030 View

Abstract Genes involved in the biogenesis of the flagellum in Caulobacter crescentus are expressed in a temporal order and are controlled by a regulatory hierarchy Strains with mutations in one of these genes flaS can not transcribe flagellar structural genes and divide abnormally This gene was cloned and it was found that its transcription is initiated early in the cell cycle Subclones that restored motility to FlaS mutants also restored normal cell division Although transcription of flaS was not dependent on any other known gene in the flagellar hierarchy it was autoregulated and subject to mild negative control by other genes at the same level of the hierarchy An additional level of control was revealed when it was found that an interruption of DNA replication caused the inhibition of flaS transcription The flaS transcript initiation site was identified and an apparently unique promoter sequence was found to be highly conserved among the genes at the same level of the hierarchy The flagellar genes with this conserved 5 region all initiate transcription early in the cell cycle and are all sensitive to a disruption in DNA replication Mutations in these genes also cause an aberrant cell division phenotype Therefore flagellar genes at or near the top of the hierarchy may be controlled in part by a unique transcription factor and may be responsive to the same DNA

Abstract Caulobacter crescentus performs chemotaxis by short intermittent reversals of rotation of its single polar flagellum Tn5 insertions causing a general chemotaxis phenotype an inability to reverse swimming direction and to form large swarm colonies have been mapped to an region of the crescentus genome These Tn5 mutations had different effects on the chemotaxis proteins MCP and the activities of methyltransferase and methylesterase The Tn5 insertion mutant SC1130 had no MCP and had reduced levels of activity of the methyltransferase and methylesterase Other mutants bearing Tn5 insertions retained MCP activity and were altered only in their methyltransferase and methylesterase activities Using a cosmid library we isolated a clone that complemented SC1130 Complementation studies of the Tn5 mutants using derivatives of the cosmid clone showed that all the Tn5 insertions lie within a single operon that appears to encode many chemotaxis genes The first gene in this operon was shown to encode an MCP by analysis of strains carrying protein fusions to portions of the operon The promoter of this operon was located by chromosomal integration of subclones of this region and by identifying DNA fragments that were capable of expressing lacZ transcriptional fusions The transcription of the che operon occurred at a defined time in the cell cycle prior to cell

temporally controlled and their order of expression reflects the sequence of assembly Transcription of the operon containing the structural gene for the flagellar hook protein occurs at a defined time in the cell cycle and information necessary for transcription is contained within a region between and from the transcription start site To identify the sequence elements that contribute to the temporal control of hook operon transcription we constructed deletions and base changes in the 5 region and fused the mutagenized regulatory region to transcription reporter genes We demonstrate that sequences 3 to the transcription start site do not contribute to temporal control We confirm that upstream sequences between and are necessary for temporal activation and that transcription also requires sequences at to A specific binding activity for the region between and was shown to be temporally controlled appearing prior to the activation of hook operon transcription This binding activity was missing from strains containing mutations in flaO and flaW two genes near the top of the flagellar hierarchy known to be required for hook operon transcription Thus the hook operon upstream region contains a sequence element that responds to a temporally controlled factor s and in concert with a second sequence element causes the timed activation of transcription View details

the components and regulatory proteins of the Caulobacter crescentus flagellum are transcribed at specific times in the cell cycle One of these genes flbN is required early in the flagellar assembly process The flbN gene was cloned and sequenced and the time of transcription activation was determined The derived amino acid sequence indicates that fibN encodes a protein with a cleavable leader peptide The protein has identity with the protein encoded by the Salmonella typhimurium basal body gene flgH mutagenesis and gel mobility shift assays identified a binding site at from the transcription start site for a protein that functions to partially activate flbN transcription at a defined time in the cell cycle The binding region is similar to a NifA binding site normally used in the activation of some sigma 54 promoters involved in nitrogen fixation in other bacteria Transcription of a gene fusion in an Escherichia coli background was dependent on the presence of a NifA transcription factor supplied by a Rhizobium meliloti gene encoding NifA A deletion or base changes in the binding region eliminated expression of the flbN gene in coli even when a NifA protein was provided in trans suggesting that a sigma 54 promoter with an upstream activator element is used by the crescentus flbN gene A consensus sequence for a sigma 54 promoter was found at the appropriate distance 5 to one of two identified transcription start sites mutagenesis confirmed that a conserved nucleotide in this sigma 54 promoter consensus sequence was required for transcription Deletion of the region 5 to the apparent sigma 54 promoter caused a complete loss of transcription activation Transcription activation of flbN in crescentus involves the combination of several elements the site is required for full activation and other sequence elements 5 to the promoter and 3 to the transcription start site are necessary for the correct time of transcription initiation View details for Web

Caulobacter crescentus mutants with lesions in phospholipid biosynthesis have DNA replication phenotypes A crescentus mutant deficient in glycerol dehydrogenase activity gpsA blocks phospholipid synthesis ceases DNA replication and loses viability in the absence of a glycerol phosphate supplement To investigate the interaction between membrane synthesis and DNA replication during a single cell cycle we moved the gpsA mutation into a synchronizable but otherwise strain The first effect of withholding supplement was the cessation of synthesis of phosphatidylglycerol a major component of the crescentus membrane In the absence of glycerol DNA replication was initiated in the stalked cell at the correct time in the cell cycle and at the correct site on the chromosome However after replication proceeded bidirectionally for a short time DNA synthesis dropped to a low level The cell cycle blocked at a distinct middivision stalked cell and this was followed by cell death The death of the gpsA mutant could be prevented if the cells were treated with novobiocin to prevent the initiation of DNA replication Our observations suggest that the processivity of crescentus replication requires concomitant phospholipid synthesis and that cell death results from incomplete replication of the chromosome View details for Web of Science ID A1990EB36200001 View details for PubMedID

flagellar genes in Caulobacter crescentus require a sigma 54 promoter and upstream sites for transcription activation We demonstrate here that in some of these genes an region containing an integration host factor IHF consensus binding site lies between the activator and the promoter and that this region binds IHF in vitro Analysis of mutations in the region of the hook operon demonstrated that an intact site is necessary for transcription in vivo An adjacent and divergent promoter also has an IHF consensus sequence that binds IHF The IHF and enhancer sites are 3 to the transcription start site in this promoter We postulate that IHF mediates the formation of a higher order structure between the divergent promoter regions in a manner analogous to the structure generated for coli DNA recombination and that this higher order structure modulates transcription View details for Web of Science ID A1990DY49600006 View details for PubMedID 2253876 EXPRESSION OF THE

that is highly homologous to the hsp70 family of heat shock genes Analysis of the cloned and sequenced dnaK gene has shown that the deduced amino acid sequence could encode a protein of kilodaltons that is 68 identical to the DnaK protein of Escherichia coli and 49 identical to the Drosophila and human hsp70 protein family A partial open reading frame 165 base pairs 3 to the end of dnaK encodes a peptide of 190 amino acids that is 59 identical to DnaJ of coli Northern blot analysis revealed a single mRNA homologous to the cloned fragment Since the dnaK coding region is kilobases dnaK and dnaJ may be transcribed as a polycistronic message S1 mapping and primer extension experiments showed that transcription initiated at two sites 5 to the dnaK coding sequence A single start site of transcription was identified during heat shock at 42 degrees C and the predicted promoter sequence conformed to the consensus heat shock promoters of coli At normal growth temperature 30 degrees C a different start site was identified 3 to the heat shock start site that conformed to the coli sigma 70 promoter consensus sequence S1 protection assays and analysis of expression of the dnaK gene fused to the lux transcription reporter gene showed that expression of dnaK is temporally controlled under normal physiological conditions and that transcription occurs just before the initiation of DNA replication Thus in both human cells Milarski and Morimoto Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 1986 and in a simple bacterium the transcription of a hsp70 gene is temporally controlled as a function of the

and the swarmer cell progeny must differentiate into a stalked cell before it too can replicate its chromosome In an effort to understand the mechanisms that limit chromosomal replication to the stalked cell plasmid DNA synthesis was analyzed during the developmental cell cycle of crescentus and the partitioning of both the plasmids and the chromosomes to the progeny cells was examined Unlike the chromosome plasmids from the incompatibility groups Q and P replicated in all crescentus cell types However all plasmids tested showed a to higher replication rate in the stalked cells than the swarmer cells We observed that all plasmids replicated during the crescentus cell cycle with comparable kinetics of DNA synthesis even though we tested plasmids that encode very different known and putative replication proteins We determined the plasmid copy number in both progeny cell types and determined that plasmids partitioned equally to the stalked and swarmer cells We also reexamined chromosome partitioning in a strain of crescentus and confirmed an earlier report that chromosomes partition to the progeny stalked and swarmer cells in a random manner that does not discriminate

Schoenlein DeRosier Shapiro Ely B 1990 172 4 Abstract At specific times in the cell cycle the bacterium Caulobacter crescentus assembles two major polar organelles the flagellum and the stalk Previous studies have shown that flbT mutants overproduce flagellins and are unable to form chemotaxis swarm rings In this paper we report alterations in both the stalk and the flagellar structure that result from a mutation in the flagellar gene flbT Mutant strains produce some stalks that have a flagellum produce some stalks that have an extra lobe protruding from their sides have filaments lacking the flagellin and produce several unusual cell types including filamentous cells as well as predivisional cells with two stalks and predivisional cells with no stalk at all We propose that flagellated stalks arise as a consequence of a failure to eject the flagellum at the correct time in the cell cycle and that the extra stalk lobe is due to a second site for the initiation of stalk biogenesis Thus a step in the pathway that establishes the characteristic asymmetry of the crescentus cell appears to be disrupted in flbT mutants We have also identified a new structural feature at the flagellated pole and the tip of the stalk the polar particle The polar particles appear as a cluster of approximately 1 to 10 rings visible in electron micrographs of negatively stained cells This structure is absent at the flagellar pole but not in the stalks of flbT mutant predivisional cells View details for Web of Science ID A1990CW01800056 View details for PubMedID 2318810 PURIFICATION AND

Caulobacter crescentus flagellum is formed at a specific time in the cell cycle and its assembly requires the ordered expression of a large number of genes These genes are controlled in a positive hierarchy that reflects the order of assembly of the flagellum Using plasmids carrying transcriptional fusions of either a neo or a lux reporter gene to the promoters of three flagellar genes representing different ranks in the hierarchy the hook operon a basal body gene flbN and the flaO gene we have measured the level of chimeric gene expression in 13 flagellar mutant backgrounds Mutants in the hook operon or in basal body genes caused overproduction of both hook operon and basal body gene chimeric mRNAs suggesting that negative regulation is superimposed on the positive control for these early events in the flagellar hierarchy Mutants in the structural genes and in genes involved in flagellar assembly had no effect on flaO expression placing the flaO gene near the top of the hierarchy However flaO expression appears to be under negative control by two regulatory genes flaS and flaW Negative control as a response to the completion of specific steps in the assembly process

Flagellar and chemotaxis genes are transcribed at a discrete time in the Caulobacter cell cycle We demonstrate here that the expression of the Escherichia coli chemoreceptor gene tsr with kilobases of its upstream sequence is temporally controlled in Caulobacter crescentus The tsr gene was placed on the chromosome in single copy or on a plasmid It was found that the Tsr protein appeared at the same point in the cell cycle as an endogenous crescentus chemotaxis protein Nuclease S1 mapping experiments showed that the tsr transcript was also controlled by the cell cycle suggesting that the coli tsr gene is regulated by crescentus factors that mediate the timing of transcription initiation The apparent transcription start site of the coli tsr gene was determined in both coli and crescentus and we found that in both backgrounds the promoter used conforms to the consensus sequence for the promoters of the flagellar and chemosensory genes of Bacillus subtilis and coli The use of this promoter suggests that crescentus has a cognate sigma factor and predicts that other crescentus genes are expressed from this consensus promoter View details for Web of Science ID A1989U940700029 View details

is approximately 10 nm in length On the basis of its location in the complex this region may contain proteins Next to this is the third region which is approximately 60 nm in length Antibody decoration experiments using mutant strains with deletions of the structural gene for the 29 x 10 3 Mr flagellin flgJ showed that the presence of this region is correlated with the expression of the

the 25 x 10 3 Mr flagellin The rest of the filament region V is made up predominantly if not completely of the 25 x 10 3 Mr flagellin Except for the hook there are no morphological features that would

Abstract The bacterium Caulobacter crescentus has a single polar flagellum which is present for only a portion of its cell cycle The flagellum is ejected from the swarmer cell and then synthesized de novo later in the cell cycle The flagellum is composed of a transmembrane basal body a hook and a filament averaging and image reconstruction methods were applied to the electron micrographs of negatively stained basal bodies from crescentus These basal bodies have five rings threaded on a rod The L and P rings are connected by a bridge of material at their outer radii The E ring is a thin flat disk The S ring has a triangular cross section the sides of the triangle abutting the E ring the rod and the M ring The M ring which is at the inner membrane of the cell has a different structure depending on the method of preparation With one method the M ring makes a snug contact with the S ring and is often capped by an axial button a new component apparently distinct from the M ring With the other method the M ring is similar to that of typhimurium that is it contacts the S ring only at an outer radius and lacks the button Averages of the subassembly ejected by swarmer cells reveal that the rod consists of two parts with the E ring marking the approximate position of the break The structures of basal bodies from two mutants defective in the hook assembly were found to be indistinguishable from basal bodies suggesting that the assembly of the basal body is independent of the hook or filament assembly View details for Web of Science ID A1989T211600005 View details for

of the bacterial flagellum and chemotaxis apparatus in both Escherichia coli and Caulobacter crescentus requires the ordered expression of over 40 genes whose expression is controlled by a regulatory hierarchy In crescentus additional control mechanisms ensure that the transcription of these genes is initiated at the correct time in the cell cycle We demonstrate here that two flagellar genes flaE and flaY whose products function in trans to modulate the level of transcription of other flagellar genes are themselves temporally controlled DNA sequence analysis of the 3413 encompassing the flaE and flaY coding sequences and the 5 regulatory region showed that flaE encodes a protein of Mr and flaY a protein of Mr Evidence that flaE and flaY are transcribed as a polycistronic message includes 1 the polar effect of Tn5 insertions 2 deletion analysis showing that the flaE promoter is essential for complementation of both flaE and flaY alleles and 3 nuclease S1 assays showing protection of a transcript spanning both genes The transcript start site in front of flaE was determined and the region conforms to the coli sigma 28 promoter consensus sequence Nuclease S1 analysis also revealed a protected fragment whose size was consistent with a transcript initiating in vivo at a consensus nif promoter sequence in front of the flaY gene The entire promoter region and an upstream consensus

POSITIONING OF DURING CAULOBACTER JOURNAL OF CELL SCIENCE Shapiro Gober 1989 Abstract Caulobacter crescentus has one of the simplest known developmental programs that exhibits both temporal and spatial organization A hallmark of the Caulobacter cell cycle is that the progeny cells that result from each cell division differ from one another with respect to structure and developmental program The process of establishing asymmetry prior to cell division requires that a number of gene products be targeted to a pole of the predivisional cell and consequently segregated to one of the two

structure and developmental program Chromosome replication initiates in the daughter stalked cell but is repressed in the daughter swarmer cell until later in the cell cycle To study DNA initiation chromosome replication was directly analyzed by gel electrophoresis Analysis of Dra I restriction fragments of DNA taken at various times from synchronized cell cultures labeled with 3H guanosine has allowed us to determine the origin of DNA replication the rate and direction of fork movement and the order of gene replication The first labeled Dra I fragment to appear contains the site of replication initiation Based on the correlation of the physical and genetic maps derived by Ely and Gerardot Ely B Gerardot J 1988 Gene 68 the origin was localized to a fragment containing the rrnA gene Furthermore the sequential replication through unmapped Dra I fragments has enabled us to localize their positions on the genome The order of appearance of labeled restriction fragments revealed that the chromosome replicates bidirectionally at a fork movement rate of 21 kilobases per minute View details for Web of Science ID A1989R820200026 View details for PubMedID 2911562 ORGANIZATION AND TEMPORAL EXPRESSION OF A FLAGELLAR BASAL BODY GENE IN JOURNAL OF BACTERIOLOGY Hahnenberger Shapiro 1988 170 9 Abstract Caulobacter crescentus assembles a single polar flagellum at a defined time in the cell cycle The protein components of the flagellar hook and filament are synthesized just prior to their assembly We demonstrated that the expression of a gene flaD that is involved in the formation of the flagellar basal body is under temporal control and is transcribed relatively early in the cell cycle before the hook and flagellin genes are transcribed Thus the order of flagellar gene transcription reflects the order of assembly of the protein components A mutation in the flaD gene results in the assembly of a partial basal body which is missing the outermost P and L rings as well as the external hook and filament Hahnenberger and Shapiro Mol Biol 1987 The flaD gene was cloned and characterized by nucleotide sequencing and S1 nuclease protection assays In contrast to the protein components of the hook and filament the protein encoded by the flaD gene contains a hydrophobic leader peptide The predicted amino acid sequence of the leader peptide of flaD is very similar to the leader peptide of the flagellar basal body P ring of Salmonella typhimurium Homma Komeda Iino and Macnab Bacteriol 1987 View details for Web of Science ID A1988P905300045 View details for

defined time period in the cell cycle Two genes encoding the major components of the flagellar filament the 25K and the flagellins are expressed coincident with flagellar assembly A third gene flgJ is also temporally regulated The synthesis of the product of flgJ the 29K flagellin occurs prior to the synthesis of the other flagellin proteins We demonstrate here that the time of initiation of flgJ expression is independent of chromosomal location but is dependent upon sequences present upstream of the flgJ structural gene Evidence that there is transcriptional control of flgJ expression includes the following 1 The initial appearance of flgJ message was coincident with the onset of 29K flagellin protein synthesis and 2 expression of an NPT II reporter gene driven by the flgJ promoter was temporally correct regulation might contribute to the control of expression because the flgJ mRNA persisted for a longer period of time than did the synthesis of the 29K protein The 29K flagellin was found only in the progeny swarmer cell after cell division In a mutant strain that failed to assemble a flagellum the 29K flagellin still segregated to the presumptive swarmer cell demonstrating that positioning of the protein is independent of filament assembly Analysis of a chimeric II transcriptional fusion showed that the flgJ regulatory sequences do not control the segregation of the 29K flagellin to the swarmer cell progeny suggesting that correct segregation depends on the protein product View details for Web of Science ID A1987J718100012 View details for PubMedID 3315855 ASYMMETRIC SEGREGATION OF PROTEINS UPON IN JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR BIOLOGY REUTER Shapiro 1987 194 4 Abstract Three Caulobacter crescentus proteins were shown to be immunologically related to the Escherichia coli proteins GroEL Lon and DnaK A fourth protein was detected with antibody to the crescentus RNA polymerase This Mr protein might be related to the coli Mr sigma subunit The synthesis of the major crescentus RNA polymerase sigma factor was not induced by heat shock The coli GroEL protein and the related protein from crescentus were also induced by treatment with hydrogen peroxide Like some of the proteins in the protein families of Drosophila and yeast the four proteins in crescentus were found to be regulated developmentally under normal conditions All four proteins were synthesized in the predivisional cell but the progeny showed cell bias in the level of enhanced synthesis after heat shock The Mr Lon homolog and the Mr RNA polymerase subunit were preferentially synthesized in the stalked cell whereas the synthesis of the Mr GroEL homolog was enhanced in the progeny swarmer cell Furthermore the four proteins synthesized in the predivisional cell were partitioned in a specific manner upon cell division The stalked cell which initiates chromosome replication immediately upon division received the Lon homolog the DnaK homolog and the Mr RNA polymerase subunit The GroEL homolog however was distributed equally to both the stalked cell and the swarmer cell These results provide access to the functions of crescentus proteins under both normal and stress conditions They also allow an investigation of the regulatory signals that modulate the asymmetric distribution of proteins and their subsequent cell expression in the initial stages of a developmental program View

1987 194 1 Abstract The assembly of a functional flagellum in the bacterium Caulobacter crescentus requires the protein products of approximately 30 genes expressed in a temporally discrete and spatially distinct manner Our current understanding of this system has been limited by the fact that purified protein products are available for only about of these genes A genetically engineered transposon promoter probe containing a promoterless gene encoding neomycin phosphotransferase II NPTase II was used to generate a series of kanamycin resistant strains of crescentus These allow the expression of NPTase II to be controlled by flagellar promoters and thus questions of temporal regulation of flagellar genes can be addressed without the need to obtain purified protein products The flagellar promoters accessed by exhibited temporal regulation analogous to the known flagellar and chemotaxis gene products The expression of NPTase II in these mutants is read from a chimeric mRNA that initiates in a chromosomal fla promoter and continues through the inserted NPTase II gene Thus temporal regulation is controlled by modulating either the initiation of transcription or transcript turnover at specific times in the cell cycle Epistatic interactions between the genes accessed by the promoter probe and other flagellar loci were studied in double fla mutants generated by transducing the mutations into spontaneously derived backgrounds The synthesis of both natural fla gene products and the accessed NPTase II was assayed in these strains using antisera to purified components of the flagellum and to purified NPTase II On the basis of these interactions a hierarchy of flagellar and chemotaxis gene expression is proposed View details for Web of Science ID

control To help to define the order of assembly of the flagellar components and to identify the genes involved in the early steps of basal body construction mutants defective in basal body formation have been analyzed Mutants in the flaD flaB flaC gene cluster were found to be unable to assemble a complete basal body The flaD BC motC region was cloned and the genes were localized by subcloning and complementation analysis A series of Tn5 insertion mutations in the flaD BC region were mapped Complementation analysis of the Tn5 insertion mutants indicated the existence of at least four transcriptional units in the region and identified the presence of two new genes designated flbN and flbO Mutants in flbN flaB flaC and flbO were unable to assemble any basal body structure and are likely to be involved in the early steps of basal body formation The flaD mutant however was found to contain a partially assembled basal body consisting of the rod and three rings All of the mutants in this cluster exhibited pleiotropic effects on the expression of other flagellar and chemotaxis functions including the level of synthesis of flagellins the hook protein and hook protein precursor

temporally regulated during the Caulobacter crescentus cell cycle Using plasmid complementation we have mapped the extent of the flaY and flaE genes These genes function in trans to regulate the expression of the flagellin genes and the chemotaxis genes We have found that the trans regulation that modulates the amount of the flagellins and the chemotaxis proteins can be separated from the temporal control of fla and che gene expression This conclusion is based on two observations the low level of synthesis of flagellins and chemotaxis proteins in flaY and flaE mutant strains occurred at the correct time in the cell cycle and complementation with plasmids containing intact flaY and flaE genes resulted in the synthesis of normal levels of flagellins and chemotaxis gene products with

genes located at six different positions on the Caulobacter crescentus chromosome The cheR cheB and cheT genes appeared to be located in a cluster Mutations in these three genes resulted in the inability of the flagellum to reverse the direction of rotation Defects in the cheR gene resulted in a loss of the ability to methylate the chemotaxis proteins In vitro experiments showed that the lack of in vivo methylation in cheR mutants was due to the absence of methyltransferase activity Defects in the cheB gene resulted in greatly reduced methylation in vivo and a loss of methylesterase

3 Abstract The chemotaxis proteins MCPs are membrane receptors that initiate signal transduction to the flagellar rotor upon ligand binding The synthesis of these proteins occurs only in the Caulobacter crescentus predivisional cell coincident with the biosynthesis of the polar flagellum Both the flagellum and the MCPs are partitioned to only one daughter cell the swarmer cell upon division We report the results of experiments designed to determine the distribution of these MCPs within swarmer cells and predivisional cells Flagellated and vesicles were prepared from these cells by immunoaffinity chromatography and the level of MCPs that had been labeled either in vivo or in vitro with was determined Small membrane vesicles from swarmer cells contained MCPs both in the flagellated and vesicles which indicates that the region immediately surrounding the flagellum as well as the rest of the surface of the swarmer cell contains MCP Thus the MCPs are not specifically localized to the immediate vicinity of the flagellar rotor The distribution of MCPs was examined in flagellated and vesicles isolated from predivisional cells The analysis of small predivisional vesicles showed that the MCP content is higher in the flagellated vesicles and analysis of large flagellated vesicles showed that the MCPs are positioned preferentially in the swarmer cell portion of the predivisional cell This positional bias of MCPs within predivisional cells could reflect either a large compartment or membrane domain within the incipient swarmer cell or a gradient of MCPs with

acid as sole carbon source Five enzymes of the fatty acid pathway A CoA synthase crotonase thiolase dehydrogenase and dehydrogenase were identified The activities of these enzymes were significantly higher in crescentus than the fully induced levels observed in Escherichia coli Growth in glucose or glucose plus oleic acid decreased fatty acid uptake and lowered the specific activity of the enzymes involved in by to in contrast to the glucose repression found in coli The mild glucose repression of the synthase was reversed by exogenous dibutyryl cyclic AMP synthase activity was shown to be the same in oleic cells and in cells grown in the presence of succinate a carbon source not affected by catabolite repression Thus fatty acid degradation by the pathway is constitutive in crescentus and is only mildly affected by growth in the presence of glucose Tn5 insertion mutants unable to form colonies when oleic acid was the sole carbon source were isolated However these mutants efficiently transported fatty acids and had enzyme levels comparable with that of the wild type Our inability to obtain fatty acid degradation mutants after a wide search coupled with the high constitutive levels of the enzymes suggest that fatty acid turnover as has proven to be the case fatty acid biosynthesis might play an essential role in membrane biogenesis and cell cycle events in

ribosomal RNA gene cluster that lacks the major promoter region 5 to the 16 S rRNA gene The predominant transcription start site in vitro was located near the 3 end of the 16 S rRNA gene Transcription initiation from this region was also detected in vivo when the cloned rRNA gene cluster was present on a plasmid The transcription start sites in vitro and in vivo were shown to be identical by S1 nuclease mapping and were found to be located approximately 300 nucleotides upstream from the 3 end of the 16 S rRNA gene The transcript synthesized in vitro was shown to be cleaved by crescentus RNase III and to release the transfer RNA genes from the downstream 16 S intergenic spacer region Analysis of the nucleotide sequence near the internal 16 S rRNA transcription start site revealed the presence of a consensus promoter sequence followed by the beginning of an open reading frame approximately 90 nucleotides downstream Examination of the 16 S rRNA genes from other bacterial species and chloroplasts and 18 S rRNA genes from Xenopus and yeast revealed that the nucleotide sequence of this internal 16 S rRNA promoter region was highly conserved Although the length of these 16 S and 18 S

another both structurally and functionally By focusing on the biogenesis of the polar flagellum and the proteins of the chemosensory system several laboratories have now defined an extensive network of genes whose temporal expression is controlled in the predivisional cell The differential of these genes contributes to the generation of asymmetry in the predivisional cell in that the products of these genes are targeted to specific cellular locations To define the mechanisms that mediate this temporal and spatial control fla genes whose products are not known were accessed by the insertion of drug resistance markers The transposons were altered so that upon insertion into the chromosome transcription fusions are formed in which the promoter regions of fla genes drive the expression of the downstream drug resistance genes Assays of the differential placement of the drug resistance proteins encoded within the interrupted fla genes allow us to determine whether the positioning of the fla gene products is controlled by signal sequences in their proteins by specific sequences in the regions of these genes or by specific transcription from only one of the two newly replicated chromosomes

COMPLEMENTATION PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF SCIENCES Bryan Purucker Gomes Alexander Shapiro 1984 81 5 Abstract The biosynthesis of the single polar flagellum and the proteins that comprise the chemotaxis methylation machinery are both temporally and spacially regulated during the Caulobacter crescentus cycle The genes involved in these processes are widely separated on the chromosome The region of the chromosome defined by flaE mutations contains at least one flagellin structural gene and appears to regulate flagellin synthesis and flagellar assembly The protein product of the adjacent flaY gene was found to be required to regulate the expression of several flagellin proteins and the assembly of a functional flagellum We demonstrate here that each of these genes is also required for the expression of chemotaxis methylation genes known to map elsewhere on the chromosome In order to study the regulation of these genes plasmids were constructed that contain either an intact flaYE region or deletions in the region of flaY These plasmids were mated into a strain and into strains containing various Tn5 insertion and deletion mutations and a mutation in the flaYE region The presence of a plasmid containing the flaYE region allowed the mutant strains to swim and to exhibit chemotaxis to synthesize increased amounts of the flagellins to methylate their chemotaxis proteins MCPs and to regain levels of methyltransferase activity Chromosomal deletions that extend beyond the cloned region were not complemented by this plasmid Plasmids containing small deletions in the flaY region failed to restore to any flaY or flaE mutants the ability to swim or to assemble a flagellar filament When mated into a strain plasmids bearing deletions in the flaY region were found to be recessive The pleiotropic regulation of flagellin synthesis assembly and chemotaxis methylation functions exhibited by both the flaY and flaE genes suggest that their gene products function in a regulatory hierarchy that controls both flagellar and chemotaxis gene expression View details for Web of Science ID A1984SJ69300012 View details

which includes i the auxotrophic requirement ii cell death in cultures attempting to grow on glucose in the absence of fatty acids or biotin and iii a major change in the outer membrane protein composition before cell death This genetic lesion did not appear to affect directly a fatty acid biosynthetic reaction because fatty acid and phospholipid syntheses were found to continue in the absence of supplement Oleic acid repressed fatty acid biosynthesis and induced fatty acid degradation in the parent AE5000 The mutant strain AE6000 was altered in both of these regulatory functions The AE6000 mutant also showed specific inhibition of the synthesis of outer membrane and flagellar proteins Total phospholipid DNA RNA and protein syntheses were unaffected The multiple phenotypes of the AE6000 mutant were found to cosegregate and to map between hclA and lacA on the crescentus chromosome The defect in this mutant appears to be associated with a regulatory function in membrane

the transposon to bacteria such as Caulobacter Rhizobium and Agrobacterium without retention of the plasmid The probe carries an altered Tn5 transposon that allows detection of chromosomal promoter regions by virtue of acquired kanamycin resistance A fragment of DNA containing the neomycin phosphotransferase II NPT II gene from Tn5 lacking its promoter region but retaining its translation initiation signal was inserted into a Tn5 derivative that lacked the entire NPT II gene and a large portion of the IS50L sequence while retaining its ability to transpose This Tn5 derivative also contained the intact tetracycline region of the transposon Tn10 Transposition of the promoter probe into the Caulobacter crescentus chromosome generated auxotrophic and motility mutants and Southern blot analysis of DNA from these mutants showed sequences in chromosomal restriction fragments Transcriptional regulation by exogenous cysteine of NPT II gene expression was demonstrated in a cysteine auxotroph generated by insertional inactivation NPT II synthesis measured by agar plate assays of kanamycin resistance and by immunoprecipitation of the NPT II protein was repressed in the presence of cysteine and derepressed in its absence Several mutants were also isolated by mutagenesis and shown to confer kanamycin resistance Insertions within temporally regulated genes such as those involved

involved in chemotaxis methylation reactions have been identified in Caulobacter crescentus and their activities times of synthesis and cellular positions have been determined The chemotaxis proteins the and the methylesterase were all shown to be active in the swarmer cell but all three activities were lost after the swarmer cells shed their flagellum and differentiated into a stalked cell The membrane chemotaxis proteins were shown to be synthesized before cell division coincident with the synthesis of the components of the flagellum and to be specifically localized in the membrane of the incipient swarmer cell portion of the predivisional cell The cytoplasmic methylesterase was also found to be differentially synthesized coincident with the period of flagellar biogenesis Furthermore methyltransferase activity present in the predivisional cell was detected only in the swarmer cell upon cell division These results demonstrate that the chemotaxis methylation machinery is positionally biased toward one portion of the predivisional cell and that the time of expression of a set of fla and che genes is correlated with the positioning of their gene products within the cell

of Caulobacter crescentus AE6001 which displays a strict requirement for unsaturated fatty acids to grow on glucose as the carbon source has been isolated Starvation of AE6001 for unsaturated fatty acids resulted in a block in the cell cycle Starved cultures accumulated at the predivisional cell stage after a round of DNA replication had been completed and after a flagellum had been assembled at the pole of the cell Cell division and cell growth failed to occur probably because the mutant was unable to synthesize a membrane An analysis of double mutants containing the fatB503 allele and other mutations in membrane biogenesis demonstrated that the cell cycle of AE6001 blocked at a homeostatic state The addition of oleic acid to starved cultures permitted cell division and the initiation of a new round of DNA replication The coincident block in both the initiation of DNA replication and membrane assembly exhibited by starved cultures of this mutant suggests that the fatB503 gene product

requirement for monovalent cations and can be eluted from a poly I C agarose affinity column in pure form This enzyme like RNase III isolated from Escherichia coli processes precursor ribosomal RNAs and polycistronic phage mRNAs and has a monomeric Mr of approximately The two enzymes differ however in the recognition of specific cleavage sites and yield different digestion products when either

an in vitro reaction crescentus phage phi Cdl major early mRNA synthesized in vitro by host RNA polymerase was processed by RNase III to yield RNA species which with phage RNA synthesized in vivo in phi cells and b an in vitro transcript of a crescentus DNA clone containing the entire 16 S gene and part of the 23 S gene was processed by crescentus RNase III to yield an RNA product which with 16 S

Shapiro 1983 258 14 Abstract Transcription of Escherichia coli and Caulobacter crescentus phage DNAs by their respective host RNA polymerase was examined to determine their ability to recognize specific transcription signals on the heterologous template Analysis of coliphage T7 in vitro transcripts showed that like the coli enzyme the crescentus RNA polymerase initiated transcription from the three major T7 early promoters and recognized the terminator at the end of the early region On the other hand several differences were found between the crescentus and coli RNA polymerases with respect to their interaction with Caulobacter phage phiCdl DNA The rates of open complex formation and RNA elongation were slower when phiCdl DNA was transcribed by the coli RNA polymerase In addition transcription of phiCdl DNA by the coli enzyme produced a subset of transcripts not synthesized by the crescentus enzyme The production of these different transcripts by the coli enzyme was dependent on salt concentration and in at least one case appeared to be the result of differential termination Although both enzymes protected the same sites on phiCdl DNA from cleavage with HincII the coli enzyme was unable to form stable complexes with some phiCdl restriction fragments that formed stable complexes with the crescentus RNA polymerase These results indicate that although the crescentus RNA polymerase can accurately recognize transcription signals on a heterologous phage template the coli enzyme exhibits altered specificity with a heterologous phage template of higher G C content

of the chemotaxis machinery the ability to methylate the carboxyl side chains of a specific set of membrane proteins chemotaxis proteins MCPs is present in crescentus This conclusion is based on the observations that i methionine auxotrophs starved of methionine can swim only in the forward direction comparable to smooth swimming in the enteric bacteria ii a specific set of membrane proteins was found to be methylated in vivo and the incorporated 3H methyl groups were alkali sensitive iii this same set of membrane proteins incorporated methyl groups from in vitro and iv out of a total of eight generally nonchemotactic mutants two were found to swim only in a forward direction and one of these lacked methyltransferase activity Analysis of in vivo and in vitro methylation in synchronized cultures showed that the methylation reaction is lost when the flagellated swarmer cell differentiates into a stalked cell In vivo methylation reappeared coincident with the biogenesis of the flagellum just prior to cell division In vitro reconstitution experiments with heterologous cell fractions from different cell types showed that swarmer cells contain methyltransferase and their membranes can be methylated However newly differentiated stalked cells lack methyltransferase activity and membranes from these cells can not accept methyl groups These results demonstrate that MCP methylation is confined to that portion of the cell cycle when flagella are present View details for Web of Science ID A1983RE89100021 View details for PubMedID 6577421 ISOLATION OF A CAULOBACTER

Caulobacter crescentus assembles a single polar flagellum from protein components synthesized at a specific time in the cell cycle Of the 26 genes required for flagellum production at least 4 of E F and together in a single cluster We have isolated DNA from this region of the chromosome by using a nonmotile mutant with a Tn5 insertion into flaE crescentus DNA carrying the region and adjacent sequences was cloned into pBR325 and selected by kanamycin resistance The resulting plasmid was used as a probe to isolate the flaE region from a gene bank and to determine the chromosomal location of several deletion and insertion mutations within the cluster At least three promotors and three major transcripts were shown to originate from the cloned gene cluster The role of these genes in flagellar biogenesis was examined by immunoprecipitation of mutant cell extracts with antiflagellin antibody Deletions extending rightward into this gene cluster eliminated one of the two flagellin

Shapiro Henry 1982 151 3 Abstract The fatty acid composition of the dimorphic bacterium Caulobacter crescentus was found to consist primarily of and fatty acids both saturated and monounsaturated in agreement with the findings of Chow and Schmidt Microbiol 1974 In addition two minor but as yet unidentified fatty acids were detected Chromatographic mobilities suggested that these fatty acids may be a cyclopropane and a fatty acid In addition we demonstrated that the fatty acid composition of crescentus can be altered by growing the cells in medium supplemented with any one of a variety of unsaturated fatty acids Linoleic acid a diunsaturated fatty acid which is not synthesized by crescentus was incorporated into phospholipids without apparent modification In addition we found that crescentus like Escherichia coli synthesizes vaccenic acid delta 11 cis rather than oleic acid delta 9 cis This result allowed us to deduce that the mechanism of fatty acid desaturation in crescentus is anaerobic as it is in coli Finally we examined the fatty acid biosynthesis and composition of two unsaturated fatty acid auxotrophs of crescentus Neither of these mutants resembled the coli unsaturated fatty acid auxotrophs which have defined enzymatic lesions in fatty acid biosynthesis Rather the mutants appeared to have defects relating to the complex coordination of membrane

HOST BIOCHEMISTRY Amemiya Shapiro 1982 21 19 Abstract Transcription of the Caulobacter crescentus phage phi Cd1 genome requires both the host RNA polymerase and a RNA polymerase Transcription of the early region of the phi Cd1 genome was examined in vitro with crescentus RNA polymerase Four transcripts A B C and D which ranged in size from X 10 6 to X 10 6 daltons were synthesized in vitro by the holoenzyme Transcript A appeared to be the major transcript since a it was the size of the entire 20 of the genome shown in vivo to code for the early phage mRNA b it was one of the first transcripts synthesized at low molar ratios and c it was synthesized in approximately 3 times the molar equivalent observed for the other transcripts The A transcript initiated primarily with GTP although a portion was also labeled with ATP The B C and D transcripts were present in equivalent molar ratios were all smaller than transcript A and were found to yield RNase III digestion products that were subsets of each other as well as of transcript A Each of these transcripts proved to be a de novo transcript since a each could be pulse labeled during the initial 20 s of the reaction and b each transcript contained a triphosphate at its 5 terminus Evidence is presented that suggests that the B and C transcripts initiate at or near the major A promoter but terminate at different termination or pause sites within the early region of the phage genome Transcript D appears to initiate at a minor promoter within the terminally redundant region of the genome preceding the A promoter View

observed that the final step in the swarmer cell transition stalk elongation was inhibited under these conditions Since an early effect of inhibiting phospholipid synthesis in crescentus is the termination of deoxyribonucleic acid DNA replication Contreras Bender Weissborn Amemiya Mansour Henry and Shapiro Mol Biol 1980 we questioned whether the inhibition of stalk formation was due directly to the inhibition phospholipid synthesis or secondarily to the inhibition of DNA synthesis Under conditions which inhibited DNA synthesis but permitted phospholipid synthesis growth of a DNA

whole genome and isolated fragments and hybridization of isolated fragments to restriction fragments generated by other restriction enzymes The genome of phi Cd1 was found to be terminally repetitive

indistinguishable in continuously labeled cultures if the two cell types were for a short time period marked differences in the pattern of phospholipid synthesis were detected swarmer cells exhibited a higher proportion of phosphatidic acid and a lower proportion of phosphatidylglycerol In addition minor phospholipids were detected in the swarmer cells that were not detected in stalked cells Stalked cells that developed directly from swarmer cells showed that same phospholipid profile as the swarmer cells The switch to the second phospholipid profile was observed to occur at the predivisional cell stage Because cell division then yielded a swarmer cell with a different phospholipid profile than its sibling stalked cell the cell division process may trigger a mechanism which alters the pattern of phospholipid synthesis View details for Web of Science ID A1980JF34600034 View details for PubMedID 7353999 THE EFFECT OF TERMINATION OF MEMBRANE ON EVENTS IN CAULOBACTER JOURNAL

Escherichia coli chromosome are transposable genetic elements of known nucleotide sequence These elements can modulate gene expression but it is not known whether they normally function in genetic control To determine whether IS elements could exert control through specific RNA transcripts we hybridised lambda NNC1857 r14 carrying IS1 and pBR322 carrying a portion of IS2 to Northern blots of

both 23S and 16S rRNA Additional homologous sequences in phi X174 and a leader region of a ribosomal protein gene cluster were also detected The homologous sequence between IS2 and 16S rTNA is the same sequence in phi X174 DNA which codes for the ends of the E and D gene and the start of J The partial IS sequences may represent silent evolutionary remnants or they could modulate the expression

sequence contains a tandemly repeated tetranucleotide sequence which resembles the repeated sequence at the hot spot for spontaneous mutations in the lacI gene Farabaugh Schmeissner Hofer and Miller

the two upper rings differed being 32 and 21 nm respectively The lower rings were all approximately 21 nm in diameter although they varied significantly in width During the normal course of the crescentus cell cycle the polar flagellum with hook and rod was shed into the culture medium without the basal rings Similarly hooks with attached rods were shed from nonflagellate mutants and these

derivatives of cyclic AMP are present Spontaneous mutants have been isolated which are able to grow on galactose in the absence of exogenous cyclic nucleotides These mutants and the strain were used to determine the pathway of galactose catabolism in this organism It is shown here that crescentus catabolizes galactose by the pathway Galactose is initially converted to galactonate by galactose dehydrogenase and then aldolase catalyzes the hydrolysis of acid to yield triose phosphate and pyruvate Two enzymes of galactose catabolism galactose dehydrogenase and aldolase were shown to be inducible and independently regulated Furthermore galactose uptake was observed to be regulated independently of the galactose catabolic enzymes View details for Web of Science ID A1978FL46900030 View

events in Caulobacter crescentus CB13 has been shown to be associated with regulation of carbohydrate utilization Growth on lactose and galactose depends on induction of specific enzymes Prior growth on glucose results in a delay in enzyme expression and cell cycle arrest at the nonmotile predivisional stage Dibutyryl cyclic adenosine AMP was shown to stimulate expression of the inducible enzymes and thus the initiation of the cell cycle mutants did not exhibit a cell cycle arrest upon transfer of cultures from glucose to lactose Furthermore carbon source starvation results in accumulation of the cells at the predivisional stage The cell cycle arrest therefore results from nutritional deprivation and is analogous to the general control system exhibited by yeast Hartwell Bacteriol Rev 1974 Wolfner et Mol Biol 1975 which coordinates cell cycle initiation with metabolic state Transfer of crescentus CB13 from glucose to mannose did not result in a cell cycle arrest and it was demonstrated that this carbon source is metabolized by constitutive enzymes Growth on mannose however is stimulated by exogenous dibutyryl cyclic AMP without a concomitant increase in the specific activity of the mannose catabolic enzymes The effect of cyclic AMP on growth on sugars metabolized by inducible enzymes as well as on sugars metabolized by constitutive enzymes may represent a regulatory system common to both types of sugar utilization since they share features that differ from glucose utilization namely growth and low intracellular concentrations of cyclic guanosine View details for Web of

the stalk has been observed by microscope during the differentiation of a stalked cell in preparation for cell division By pulsing synchronized cultures with 14 acids it has been demonstrated that the

during its life cycle including the coincident expression of synthesis of flagella pili and receptor sites for DNA bacteriophage Upon transfer of a mixed population of cells to medium containing lactose as the sole carbon source these changes were blocked for about 20 hr until activity became apparent The addition of dibutyryl cyclic AMP to the blocked cultures brought about the resumption of cell differentiation growth and the appearance of activity within 1 hr Unlike Escherichia coli the intracellular and extracellular concentrations of cyclic AMP in crescentus did not vary under several

SCIENCE Shapiro AGABIANK BENDIS I 1971 173 4000 Abstract The foregoing studies are intended to define a differentiation process and to permit genetic access to the mechanisms that control this process In order to elucidate the basic mechanisms whereby a cell dictates its own defined morphogenic changes we have found it helpful to study an organism that can be manipulated both biochemically and genetically We have attempted to develop the studies initiated by Poindexter Stove and Stanier and Schmidt and Stanier 16 17 20 with the Caulobacter genus so that these bacteria can serve as a model system for prokaryotic differentiation The Caulobacter life cycle defined in synchronously growing cultures includes a sequential series of morphological changes that occur at specific times in the cycle and at specific locations in the cell Six distinct cellular characteristics which are peculiar to these bacteria have been defined and include i the synthesis of a polar organelle which may be membranous ii a satellite DNA in the stalked cell 26 iii pili to which RNA bacteriophage specifically adsorb 16 33 iv a single polar flagellum 17 v a lipopolysaccharide phage receptor site 27 and vi new cell wall material at the flagellated pole of the cell giving rise to a stalk 19 20 Cell division essential for the viability of the organism is dependent on the irreversible differentiation of a flagellated swarmer cell to a mature stalked cell The specific features of the Caulobacter system which make it a system of choice for studies of the control of sequential events resulting in cellular differentiation can be summarized as follows 1 Cell populations can be synchronized and homogeneous populations at each stage in the differentiation cycle can thus be obtained 2 A specific technique has been developed whereby the progress of the differentiation cycle can be accurately measured by adsorption of labeled RNA phage or penetration of labeled phage DNA into specific cell forms This technique can be used to select for mutants blocked in the various stages of morphogenesis 3 mutants of Caulobacter that are restricted in macromolecular synthesis and development at elevated temperatures have been isolated 4 Genetic exchange in the Calflobacter genus has been demonstrated and is now being defined Two questions related to control processes can now readily be approached experimentally i Is the temporal progression of events occurring during bacterial differentiation controlled by regulator gene products ii Is the differentiation cycle like a biosynthetic pathway where one event must follow another The availability of mutants blocked at various stages of development permits access to both questions An interesting feature of the differentiation cycle is that the polar organelle may represent a special segregated unit which is operative in the control of the differentiation process Perhaps the sequential morphogenic changes exhibited by Caulobacter are dependent on the initial synthesis of this organelle Because the ultimate expression of cell changes are dependent on selective protein synthesis specific messenger RNA from DNA present in an organelle or from the prove to be a controlling factor in cell differentiation We have begun studies with RNA polymerase purified from Caulobacter crescentus to determine whether cell factors or alterations in the enzyme structure serve to change the specificity of transcription during the cell cycle Control of sequential cell changes at the level of transcription has long been postulated and has recently been substantiated in the case of Bacillus sporulation 6 The Caulobacter bacteria now present another system in which direct analysis of these control mechanisms is feasible View details

chemical properties of both the phage and its deoxyribonucleic acid DNA Electron micrographs reveal the phage to be among the largest DNA bacteriophages reported with head dimensions of 64 by 195 nm and a flexible tail 275 nm in length The phage is composed of 57 DNA This DNA is as indicated by i the sharp increase in extinction coefficient over a narrow range of temperature increase ii an increase in density in CsCl upon thermal denaturation and iii the equivalence of guanine and cytosine as well as adenine and thymine determined by chemical analysis phiCbK DNA cosediments with Escherichia coli phage T2 DNA and has therefore been assigned an S 20 w value of The size of the phage and its DNA and the percentage of DNA indicate that the phiCbK phage head is relatively loosely

VIROLOGY BENDIS Shapiro 1970 6 6 Abstract The ribonucleic acid RNA bacteriophage phiCb5 which specifically infects only one form of the dimorphic stalked bacterium Caulobacter crescentus has been obtained in high yield Since the phage is extremely a purification procedure was devised which avoided contact with solutions of high ionic strength Phage phiCb5 was studied with respect to the physical and chemical properties of both the phage and its RNA In an electron microscope the phage particles appear as small polyhedra 23 nm in diameter The phage is similar to the Escherichia coli RNA phages in that it i sediments at an S 20 w of ii is composed of a single molecule of RNA and a protein coat iii contains two structural proteins and iv apparently contains the genetic capacity to code for a coat protein subunit a protein and an RNA polymerase Phage phiCb5 differs from the coli RNA phages in i host specificity ii salt sensitivity and iii the presence of histidine but not methionine in the coat protein View details for Web of Science ID A1970I035400018 View details for PubMedID 5495512 Replication of the RNA genome Journal of cellular physiology August EOYANG FRANZE DE
