bone tumors on radiographs A preliminary study EBioMedicine He Pan Bao Halsey Chang Liu Peng Sebro Guan Yi Delworth Eweje States Zhang Zhang Wu Peng Bai X 2020 62 103121 Abstract BACKGROUND To develop a deep learning model to classify primary bone tumors from preoperative radiographs and compare performance with A total of 1356 patients 2899 images with histologically confirmed primary bone tumors and radiographs were identified from five institutions pathology databases Manual cropping was performed by radiologists to label the lesions Binary discriminatory capacity benign versus and malignant versus and classification benign versus intermediate versus malignant performance of our model were evaluated The generalizability of our model was investigated on data from external test set Final model performance was compared with interpretation from five radiologists of varying level of experience using the Permutations For benign not benign model achieved area under curve AUC of 0894 and 0877 on and external testing respectively For malignant not malignant model achieved AUC of 0907 and 0916 on and external testing respectively For classification model achieved 721 accuracy 746 and 721 for the two subspecialists on and respectively On external testing model achieved 734 accuracy 693 734 731 679 and 634 for the two subspecialists and three junior radiologists p 001 for radiologists respectively Deep learning can classify primary bone tumors using conventional radiographs in a dataset with similar accuracy compared to subspecialists and better performance than junior

RNA in patients and healthcare workers with Journal of clinical virology the official publication of the Pan American Society for Clinical Virology Gombar Chang Hogan Zehnder Boyd Pinsky B Shah 2020 129 104477 Abstract BACKGROUND Current guidelines for returning health care workers HCW to service after a positive test and ceasing of transmission precautions for patients is based on two general strategies A strategy that requires negative respiratory tests obtained after the resolution of symptoms Alternatively due to the limited availability of testing many sites employ a strategy that recommends excluding HCW from the workforce and keeping patients on contact precautions until a fixed period of time has elapsed from symptom recovery The underlying assumption of the strategy is that waiting for a fixed period of time is a surrogate for negative testing which itself is a surrogate for the absence of shedding infectious To better understand the appropriate length of symptom based return to work and contact precaution DESIGN We performed an observational analysis of 150 patients and HCW that transitioned from positive to negative over the course of 2 months at a US academic medical We found that the average time to transition from positive to negative was 24 days after symptom onset and 10 remained positive even 33 days after symptom onset No difference was seen in HCW and These findings suggest until definitive evidence of the length of infective viral shedding is obtained that the fixed length of time before returning to work or ceasing contract precautions be revised to over View details for DOI View details for PubMedID 32505778 Deep Learning to Distinguish Benign from Malignant Renal Lesions Based on Routine MR Imaging Clinical cancer research an

Abstract PURPOSE With increasing incidence of renal mass it is important to make a pretreatment differentiation between benign renal mass and malignant tumor We aimed to develop a deep learning model that distinguishes benign renal tumors from renal cell carcinoma RCC by applying a residual convolutional neural network ResNet on routine MR DESIGN Preoperative MR images and sequences of renal lesions definitely diagnosed on pathology or imaging in a multicenter cohort were divided into training validation and test sets split An ensemble model based on ResNet was built combining clinical variables and T1C and T2WI MR images using a bagging classifier to predict renal tumor pathology Final model performance was compared with expert interpretation and the most optimized radiomics Among the renal lesions 655 were malignant and 507 were benign Compared with a baseline zero rule algorithm the ensemble deep learning model had a statistically significant higher test accuracy P Compared with all experts averaged the ensemble deep learning model had higher test accuracy P sensitivity P and specificity P Compared with the radiomics model the ensemble deep learning model had higher test accuracy P sensitivity P and specificity P Deep learning can noninvasively distinguish benign renal tumors from RCC using conventional MR imaging in a dataset with good accuracy sensitivity and specificity comparable with experts and radiomics View details for DOI View details for PubMedID 31937619 Deep Learning Based on MRI for Differentiation of and in Renal Cell Carcinoma Journal of

carcinoma aggressiveness may help to guide clinical To evaluate the efficacy of residual convolutional neural network using routine MRI in differentiating grade from grade in stage I and II renal cell TYPE In all 376 patients with 430 renal cell carcinoma lesions from in a multicenter cohort were acquired The 353 renal cell carcinomas were divided into a training validation and test set with a split The 77 graded renal cell carcinomas were used as a separate test and and T1 The accuracy sensitivity and specificity of the final model were assessed The receiver operating characteristic ROC curve and curve were plotted to measure the performance of the binary classifier A confusion matrix was drawn to show the true positive true negative false positive and false negative of the TESTS for continuous data and the test or Fisher exact test for categorical data were used to compare the difference of clinicopathologic characteristics between the and groups The adjusted Wald method was used to calculate the 95 confidence interval CI of accuracy sensitivity and The final model achieved a test accuracy of 95 CI sensitivity of 95 CI and specificity of 95 CI in the Fuhrman test set and a test accuracy of 95 CI sensitivity of 95 CI and specificity of 95 CI in the test CONCLUSION Deep learning can noninvasively predict the histological grade of stage I and II renal cell carcinoma using conventional MRI in a multiinstitutional dataset with high OF EVIDENCE 3 TECHNICAL EFFICACY STAGE 2 View details for DOI View details for PubMedID 32222054 Report Accessibility Issues Powered By CAP
