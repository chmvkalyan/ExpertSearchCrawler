Other Names Bonnie Maldonado Current Research and Scholarly Interests The research I have conducted has been focused on epidemiologic aspects of viral vaccine development and prevention of perinatal HIV transmission A major project has been to identify the molecular epidemiology of factors affecting the immunogenicity of oral polio vaccine OPV among children living in developing areas of the world where OPV immunogenicity is poor We have identified several factors which affect the poor immunogenicity of OPV and will conduct clinical studies to attempt to improve immunogenicity We are now working on ways to understand the transmission and circulation of polio vaccine derived viruses which may cause polio and how to use this information in global eradication of polio I also work on perinatal HIV infection including strategies to prevent breastfeeding transmission in developing settings as well as understanding how to maximize prevention strategies among pregnant women in developed Maldonado Group recently received a grant from the Bill Melinda Gates Foundation for a year study investigating the dynamics of oral poliovirus vaccine OPV household and community transmission in 3 communities in Orizaba Veracruz Mexico Mexico provides a unique environment to study OPV transmission Currently Mexican children receive inactivated poliovirus vaccine IPV in their primary vaccination series In addition children years old who have received at least 2 doses of IPV are eligible to receive OPV during biannual National Immunization Weeks Our study will specifically assess the impact of different OPV vaccination rates during the February 2015 National Immunization Week on and transmission of OPV The outcome of this project will inform public policy regarding OPV cessation and the polio A second ongoing project has been to define the ontogeny of the immune response to measles vaccine among young infants The purpose is to identify specific humoral and immune responses to measles vaccine which affect vaccine immunogenicity and induce the immunosuppressive effects associated with measles final project I have conducted since 1989 involves a long term natural history study of infants with perinatal HIV exposure and infection This study involves following all and infected infants living in the Northern California and defining factors associated with progression of disease Clinical Trials Prophylaxis With Vancomycin and Cefazolin in Pediatric Cardiovascular Surgery Patients Not Recruiting The investigators hope to learn 1 if the addition of prophylaxis with vancomycin will decrease the rate of cefazolin surgical site infections SSI in high risk population 2 to develop better understanding of vancomycin and cefazolin pharmacokinetics in children undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass CPB 3 to assess the barriers to vancomycin dosing 4 to assess side effects and risks associated with vancomycin administration This will allow us to improve patient care by better understanding the benefits or the risks of vancomycin administration and potentially decrease surgical site infections In addition this study gives us the opportunity to evaluate cefazolin and vancomycin pharmacokinetics pK on children on CPB The investigators will take blood samples from 20 patients In 10 patients the investigators will do Cefazolin pK analysis and in the other 10 the investigators will do pK Vancomycin analysis For the remainder of 292 patients only prospective chart review will be done to determine the incidence of SSIs This data will be compared with 936 controls who received only Cefazolin as prophylaxis for SSI Stanford is currently not accepting patients for this trial For more information please contact Kathleen Gutierrez MD View

Equity Index Measuring Parity in the Advancement of Underrepresented Populations in Academic Medicine Academic medicine journal of the Association of American Medical Colleges Fassiotto Flores Victor Altamirano Garcia Kotadia Maldonado Y 2020 Abstract As educators researchers clinicians and administrators faculty serve pivotal roles in academic medical centers AMCs Thus the quality of faculty members experiences is inseparable from an AMC success In seeking new methods to assess equity in advancement in academic medicine the authors developed the Rank Equity Index REI from the Executive Parity Index a scale previously implemented within the business examine national data on gender and equity across faculty ranks The REI was employed on demographic data collected by the Association of American Medical Colleges from medical school faculty in 2017 to make pairwise rank comparisons of the professoriate by demographic characteristics and department Overall results indicated that women did not attain parity at any pairwise rank comparison while men were above parity at all ranks Similar results were observed across all departments surveyed women in the basic sciences had REIs closest to parity women in pediatrics had the highest representation but had REIs that were further from parity than the REIs in the basic sciences and women in surgery demonstrated the lowest REIs Nationally REIs were below for all group rank comparisons except for White and in one case multiple race Across all analyzed departments American Asian and multiple race faculty had REIs below parity at all ranks except in two cases In a comparison of 2017 and 2007 data REIs across both and gender were lower in 2007 for nearly all groups REI analyses can highlight inequities in faculty rank that may be masked when using aggregate faculty proportions which do not account for rank The REI provides AMCs with a new tool to better analyze institutional data to inform efforts to increase parity

rise Thus it is imperative to assess whether equity within medical school enrollment and along the academic pipeline has mirrored this growth especially among elite surgical specialties such as otolaryngology Census and educational data from 2010 and 2018 were used to assess the current otolaryngology surgery and internal medicine physician and faculty workforce diversity across each stage of the academic medicine trajectory by race and ethnicity We found that disparities exist in medical school enrollment for minority students such that representation was only 30 and Black representation only 50 of their respective proportions in the US population in 2018 Disparities in achieving full professorship were also observed across all 3 specialties but most prominently in otolaryngology with 1 Black representation among otolaryngology professors in 2018 A collective strategy toward diversifying the otolaryngology workforce should be explored View details for DOI View

of neurotropic pathogens or potential emerging teratogen In this retrospective population cohort study we estimated the IR of hospitalizations with a microcephaly discharge diagnosis code among infants year over a period using the Electronic Health Record EHR database from all hospital discharges in California from the Office of Statewide Hospital Planning and Development OSHPD database We calculated the overall and yearly IRs per live births LBs and per hospitalizations in infants year and explored the impact in the IR estimates when children with microcephaly associated comorbidities were excluded or Among hospital discharges of infants year in the OSHPD database over this 15year period we identified hospitalizations with a microcephaly discharge diagnosis code of those were in neonates The IR of microcephaly hospitalizations for infants year was LB for neonates it was LB and per hospitalizations year There was large heterogeneity in the yearly microcephaly IRs I2 EHR collected data could be used as a complementary approach to track epidemiologic changes in microcephaly IRs However standardization in the use of microcephaly discharge diagnosis code and harmonization in the types of additional comorbidities to be excluded across analyses is mandatory to allow for prompt identification of true changes in microcephaly rates over time View details for

hesitancy the reluctance or refusal to receive vaccination is a growing public health problem in the United States and globally State policies that eliminate nonmedical personal belief exemptions to childhood vaccination requirements are controversial and their effectiveness to improve vaccination coverage remains unclear given limited rigorous policy analysis In 2016 a California policy Senate Bill 277 eliminated nonmedical exemptions from school entry requirements The objective of this study was to estimate the association between California 2016 policy and changes in vaccine used a synthetic control analysis and a analysis to estimate the impact of the 2016 California policy on vaccination coverage and prevalence of exemptions to vaccine requirements nonmedical and medical We used publicly available data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on coverage of measles mumps and rubella MMR vaccination nonmedical exemption and medical exemption in children entering kindergarten We used data individually requested from state departments of public health on overall vaccine coverage and exemptions Based on data availability we included data for 45 states including California from 2011 to 2017 and data for 17 states from 2010 to 2017 The prespecified primary study outcome was MMR vaccination in the state analysis and overall vaccine coverage in the county analysis In the synthetic control analysis MMR coverage in California increased by relative to its synthetic control in the postpolicy period top 2 of 43 states evaluated in the placebo tests top 5 nonmedical exemptions decreased by top 2 of 43 states evaluated in the placebo tests top 5 and medical exemptions increased by top 1 of 44 states evaluated in the placebo tests top 2 In the analysis overall vaccination coverage increased by 95 confidence interval CI p nonmedical exemptions decreased by 95 CI p and medical exemptions increased by 95 CI p Changes in vaccination coverage across counties after the policy implementation from 2015 to 2017 ranged from to 26 with larger increases in coverage in counties with lower prepolicy vaccine coverage Results were robust to alternative model specifications The limitations of the study were the exclusion of a subset of US states from the analysis and the use of only 2 years of postpolicy data based on data this study implementation of the California policy that eliminated nonmedical childhood vaccine exemptions was associated with an estimated increase in vaccination coverage and a reduction in nonmedical exemptions at state and county levels The observed increase in medical exemptions was offset by the larger reduction in nonmedical exemptions The largest increases in vaccine coverage were observed in the most counties meaning those with the lowest prepolicy vaccine coverage Our findings suggest that government policies removing nonmedical exemptions can be effective at increasing vaccination

demographic characteristics of healthcare professionals themselves Patients from underrepresented groups in the United States can experience the effects of unintentional cognitive unconscious biases that derive from cultural stereotypes in ways that perpetuate health inequities Unconscious bias can also affect healthcare professionals in many ways including interactions hiring and promotion and their own interprofessional interactions The strategies described in this article can help us recognize and mitigate unconscious bias and can help create an equitable environment in healthcare

of the implementation of intrapartum antimicrobial therapy However EOS remains a serious and potentially fatal illness Laboratory tests alone are neither sensitive nor specific enough to guide EOS management decisions Maternal and infant clinical characteristics can help identify newborn infants who are at risk and guide the administration of empirical antibiotic therapy The incidence of EOS the prevalence and implications of established risk factors the predictive value of commonly used laboratory tests and the uncertainties in the balance of antibiotic exposures all vary significantly with gestational age at birth Our purpose in this clinical report is to provide a summary of the current epidemiology of neonatal sepsis among infants born at weeks gestation and a framework for the development of approaches to sepsis risk assessment among these infants View details for DOI View details for Web of Science ID 000451372200044 View details for PubMedID 30455342 Management of Neonates Born at 34 Weeks Gestation With Suspected or Proven Bacterial Sepsis PEDIATRICS Puopolo Benitz Zaoutis Comm Fetus Newborn Comm Infectious Dis 2018 142 6 Abstract sepsis EOS remains a serious and often fatal illness among infants born preterm particularly among newborn infants of the lowest gestational age Currently most preterm infants with very low birth weight are treated empirically with antibiotics for risk of EOS often for prolonged periods in the absence of a infection Retrospective studies have revealed that antibiotic exposures after birth are associated with multiple subsequent poor outcomes among preterm infants making the balance of these antibiotic treatments uncertain Gestational age is the strongest single predictor of EOS and the majority of preterm births occur in the setting of other factors associated with risk of EOS making it difficult to apply risk stratification strategies to preterm infants Laboratory tests alone have a poor predictive value in preterm EOS Delivery characteristics of extremely preterm infants present an opportunity to identify those with a lower risk of EOS and may inform decisions to initiate or extend antibiotic therapies Our purpose for this clinical report is to provide a summary of the current epidemiology of preterm neonatal sepsis and provide guidance for the development of approaches to sepsis risk assessment

virological methods Holubar Sahoo Huang Liu Waggoner Troy Maldonado Pinsky B A 2018 Abstract Polioviruses are members of the Enterovirus C species and asymptomatic fecal shedding allows for their transmission and persistence in a community as well as the emergence of polioviruses Using three assays the shedding and circulation of oral poliovirus vaccine OPV strains was previously investigated in a prospective cohort of MFexican children their contacts and nearby sewage Subsequently a deep sequencing approach targeting the P1 genomic region was applied to characterize OPV strains previously detected by Amplifiable RNA was obtained for sequencing from of stool samples and of sewage using nucleic acids extracted directly from primary specimens Sequencing detected one or more OPV serotypes in of stool and of sewage samples All stool and sewage samples in which poliovirus was not detected by deep sequencing contained at least one enterovirus C strain To improve screening specificity a modified OPV multiplex was evaluated In stool specimens the overall agreement between the original assays and the multiplex was By serotype the overall agreement was for OPV S1 for S2 and for S3 Furthermore most original negative results were collected in the summer and fall months consistent with circulation patterns In conclusion this deep sequencing approach allowed for the characterization of OPV sequences directly from clinical samples and facilitated the implementation of a more specific multiplex for OPV detection and serotyping View details for PubMedID 30447245

Infectious Diseases Society of America Sarnquist Holubar Altamirano Purington Boyle Modlin Diaz Ortega Desai Maldonado Y A 2018 67 Abstract Background We aimed to elucidate household and shedding and transmission of trivalent oral polio vaccine tOPV in communities with inactivated polio vaccine IPV routine immunization after tOPV is administered during a national health week NHW We conducted a randomized trial with data collected at baseline through 10 weeks in households with at least 1 child 5 years old in 3 communities in Orizaba Mexico Selected communities were geographically isolated but similar Each community was assigned an oral polio vaccine OPV immunization rate 10 30 or 70 of participating households From 2653 households in the 3 communities households per community were selected for 466 in total Households were randomized as vaccinated or unvaccinated with only 1 child under 5 in the vaccinated household receiving OPV during the February 2015 NHW No other community members received OPV during this NHW Stool samples were collected up to 10 weeks for all members of the 466 study households and were analyzed for the presence of OPV serotypes using a multiplex polymerase chain reaction We will report on the factors associated with and incidence and duration of household and community shedding and transmission of OPV The secondary outcomes will characterize temporal and geospatial OPV serotype shedding The current global polio eradication plan relies on transitioning away from OPV to IPV This study contributes to understanding patterns of OPV shedding

uses inactivated polio vaccine routinely as well as OPV Using geospatial maps we measured the distance and density of OPV vaccinees shedding in the areas nearest to unvaccinated households in 3 Mexican villages Comparison of transmission to unvaccinated households utilized a mixed effects logistic regression with random effects for household and time adjusted for age gender area and running The median distance from an unvaccinated household to its nearest household was 85 meters interquartile range and the median number of vaccinees shedding OPV within 200 m was 3 Transmission to unvaccinated households occurred by day 1 There was no association odds ratio OR 95 credible interval CrI between the distance from OPV shedding and the odds of transmission The number of OPV vaccinees shedding within 200 m came close to a significant association with unvaccinated transmission OR CrI but this was not the case for households 100 or 500 m apart Results were consistent across the 3 Geospatial analysis did not predict community transmission from vaccinated to unvaccinated households because OPV use resulted in rapid low transmission levels This finding supports the global

Clinical infectious diseases an official publication of the Infectious Diseases Society of America van Hoorebeke Huang Leary Holubar Altamirano Halpern Sommer Maldonado Y 2018 67 Abstract Background Global polio eradication efforts rely in part on molecular methods of detecting polioviruses both wild and vaccine strains from human and environmental samples Previous assays used for detection of Sabin oral polio vaccine OPV in fecal samples have been labor and time intensive and vary in their sensitivity and We developed a multiplex quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay able to detect all 3 OPV strains in fecal samples The assay used a KingFisher Duo Prime system for viral RNA isolation and extraction Positive samples were retested and Sanger sequenced for verification of Sabin serotype The 95 lower limit of detection was determined to be 3 copies per reaction for Sabin 1 and 3 and 4 copies per reaction for Sabin 2 with no between the 3 serotypes and their primers A total of 554 samples were positive with 304 positive samples containing 1 serotype Of the positive samples 476 contained enough RNA to be sequenced and of these all sequences were Sabin serotypes The previous assay we used could process 48 samples in a period whereas the new assay processed 100 samples in 6 The new multiplex quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay allowed for sensitive and specific detection of OPV serotypes while greatly decreasing sample handling and processing time We were able to sequence of the 210 positive samples in the cycle threshold range of View details for PubMedID

Society of America Halpern Altamirano Maldonado Y 2018 67 Abstract Background Mutations associated with prolonged replication of the attenuated polioviruses found in oral poliovirus vaccine OPV can lead to poliovirus VDPV and cause paralysis indistinguishable from that caused by wild poliovirus In response the World Health Organization has initiated the transition to exclusive use of inactivated poliovirus vaccine IPV with OPV administration in cases of outbreak However it is currently unclear how vaccination well known to provide humoral but not mucosal immunity will impact the development of paralysis causing OPV variants Children infected with human immunodeficiency virus HIV have been documented to show decreased mucosal immunity following OPV vaccination Thus children vaccinated with OPV may serve as proxy for children with We conducted a prospective study of Zimbabwean infants receiving OPV as part of their routine vaccination schedule Stool samples collected from children serially until age 24 months were tested for OPV serotypes using a polymerase chain reaction protocol that quantifies the amount of mutant OPV variants found in each Out of 2130 stool samples collected from 402 infants 365 stool samples were OPV positive 313 from 212 infants and 52 from 34 infants infants showed significantly higher proportions of OPV mutants when compared to HIV infection is associated with a reduced proportion of OPV vaccine associated paralytic polio mutants These results suggest that OPV administered to individuals previously vaccinated only with IPV will show decreased propensity for OPV mutations View details for PubMedID 30376083 Characterization of Household and Community Shedding and Transmission of Oral Polio Vaccine in Mexican Communities With

Transmission began as quickly as 1 day after vaccination and persisted as long as 71 days after vaccination Transmission within unvaccinated households differed significantly across vaccination coverage communities with the 70 community experiencing the most transmissions 15 and the 10 community experiencing the least 4 These trends persisted over time and in the time to first shedding

for poliovirus detection is acute flaccid paralysis AFP surveillance with environmental sampling serving as a complement However as AFP cases drop environmental surveillance will become increasingly critical for poliovirus detection Mexico provides a natural environment to study oral polio vaccine OPV transmission as it provides routine injected polio vaccine immunization and biannual OPV campaigns in February and As part of a study of OPV transmission in which 155 children were vaccinated with OPV monthly sewage samples were collected from rivers leading from 3 indigenous Mexican villages Capoluca Campo Grande and Tuxpanguillo from February to May 2015 Samples were also collected from October 2015 to October 2017 during which time there were standard OPV campaigns Samples were analyzed for the presence of OPV serotypes using a qualitative polymerase chain reaction assay capable of detecting as few as 9 12 and 10 L of viral ribonucleic acid for OPV serotypes 1 2 and 3 and respectively Included here are 54 samples taken up to November Of the 54 samples 13 24 were positive for OPV After the vaccination of 155 children in February 2015 OPV was found 2 months after vaccination After unrestricted OPV administration in February 2016 OPV was detected in sewage up to 8 months after vaccination was found in 11 of the 13 positive samples 85 was found in 3 positive samples 23 and was found in 1 sample 8 OPV can be detected even when small amounts of the vaccine are introduced into a community as shown by sewage samples even when only 155 children were vaccinated When OPV vaccination was unrestricted sewage samples were positive up to 8 months after vaccination implying community OPV circulation for at least 8 months was the serotype most found in these samples indicating prolonged transmission of when compared to the other serotypes Future work could compare the phylogenetic variance of OPV isolates from sewage after OPV vaccinations View details

Health Organization recommendations preventing circulation of poliovirus cVDPV is a top priority Currently the impact of prior poliovirus vaccination on OPV shedding is not fully Stool samples from 2 populations were tested for OPV to assess shedding patterns 505 samples from 43 US children vaccinated with OPV were collected over 42 days samples from 148 Mexican children vaccinated with OPV were collected over 71 days Prior vaccination history was recorded for both Seventeen 40 of the US children had never received poliovirus vaccination while the Mexican children had received at least 2 doses of IPV and 116 78 had OPV exposure In total 84 of US children and 78 of Mexican children shed OPV P Fisher exact test with a mean shedding duration of days for US children and days for Mexican children P Whitney test Prior vaccination did not affect the likelihood of shedding as the US and Mexico cohorts had similar shedding proportions However prior vaccination affected shedding duration as the Mexican children who were largely OPV exposed and all of whom had at least 2 IPV vaccinations shed OPV for half as long as the US cohort Since different countries maintain different poliovirus

quantify the transmission potential of Sabin strains from OPV when it is reintroduced accidentally or deliberately in a community vaccinated with inactivated poliovirus vaccine built an stochastic epidemiological model that allows independent spread of 3 Sabin serotypes and differential transmission rates within versus between households Model parameters were estimated by fitting to data from a

representation in that specialty Thus females in surgical specialties are especially at risk of stereotype threat Herein we present the role of gender expectations using trainee evaluations of physician faculty at a single academic center over a period Graduate Medical Education evaluation data of physician faculty from MedHub we examined the differences in evaluation scores for male and female physicians within specialties that have traditionally had low female representation surgical fields compared to those with average or high female representation pediatrics Medicine residents and fellows MedHub ratings of their physician faculty from 2010 to total of 3648 evaluations across 1066 physician female physicians received lower median scores than their male counterparts across all specialties When using regression analyses controlling for race age rank and characteristics the negative effect persists only for female physicians in specialties with low female finding suggests that female physicians in traditionally specialties may face different criteria based on expectations when being evaluated by trainees As trainee evaluations play an important role in career advancement decisions dictate perceptions of quality within academic medical centers and affect overall job satisfaction we propose that these differences in evaluations based merely on gender

demonstrated reliable detection of poliovirus mutations at levels of 1 depending on read depth Sequencing of viral nucleic acids from the stool of vaccinated asymptomatic children and their close contacts collected during a prospective cohort study in Veracruz Mexico revealed no polioviruses This was expected given that the longest duration between sequenced sample collection and the end of the most recent national immunization week was 66 days However we identified many variants 5 distributed across the 5 UTR and P1 genomic region in all three Sabin serotypes as well as viruses with multiple canonical mutations associated with phenotypic reversion present at high levels 90 These results suggest that monitoring emerging poliovirus variants by deep sequencing may aid in the poliovirus endgame and efforts to ensure global polio eradication View details for DOI View details for PubMedID 28468861 Evidence That Behavioral Interventions Reduce School Dropout Among Nairobi

Abstract Purpose Physician leadership programs serve to develop individual capabilities and to affect organizational outcomes Evaluations of such programs often focus solely on increases in individual capabilities The purpose of this paper is to assess individual and organizational outcomes of the Stanford Leadership Development Program There are three data sources for this study a survey in of program participants and matched control from the 2006 to 2011 program years promotion and retention data and qualitative interview data The authors analyzed survey data across leadership knowledge skills and attitudes as well as leadership titles held following program participation using Pearson χ2 test of independence Using logistic regression the authors analyzed promotion and retention among participants and Finally the authors applied both a grounded theory approach and qualitative content analysis to analyze interview data Findings Program participants rated higher than across 25 of 30 items measuring leadership knowledge skills and attitudes and were more likely to hold leadership titles and to have gained in leadership since program participation Asian program participants were significantly more likely than Asian to have been promoted and women participants were less likely to have left the institution than Finally qualitative interviews revealed the impact of leadership learning and networking as well as the enduring sustained impact on the organization of projects undertaken during the program This study is unique in its and comprehensive nature of

in North Central and South America led us to determine whether fathers of congenitally infected infants in the National Collaborative Congenital Toxoplasmosis Study NCCCTS have a high incidence of Toxoplasma gondii analyzed serum samples collected from NCCCTS families between 1981 and 2013 Paternal serum samples were tested for gondii antibodies with immunoglobulin Ig G dye test and IgM immunosorbent assay Additional testing of paternal serum samples was performed with and IgG avidity tests when gondii IgG and IgM results were positive and serum samples were collected by the visit of the congenitally infected child Prevalence of paternal seropositivity and incidence of recent infection were calculated We analyzed whether certain demographics maternal parasite serotype risk factors or clinical manifestations were associated with paternal gondii infection testing revealed a high prevalence 29 of 81 36 of gondii infection in fathers relative to the average seropositivity rate of for boys and men aged years in the United States between 1994 and 2004 P Moreover there was a incidence of recent infections among fathers with serum samples collected by the visit of their child 6 of

toxoplasmosis in patients in whom the date of onset of lymphadenopathy matches the window of acute infection predicted by serological tests performed at a reference laboratory We used the electronic database of the Palo Alto Medical Foundation Toxoplasma Serology Laboratory to identify cases of ATL We tested the uniformity of distribution of ATL cases per month across the 12 calendar months using circular statistics uniformity tests We identified 112 consecutive cases of ATL The distribution of cases was not uniform across the 12 calendar months We observed the highest peak of cases in December and a second highest peak in September Similar months were identified in patients with acute toxoplasmosis in rural areas in France The results were similar when we performed weighted analyses weighting for the total number of Toxoplasma gondii IgG tests performed per month in the laboratory This is the largest study to date of the seasonal variation of ATL in the United States

JOURNAL OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES Troy Kouiavskaia Siik Kochba Beydoun Mirochnitchenko Levin Khardori Chumakov Maldonado Y 2015 211 12 Abstract Inactivated polio vaccine IPV is necessary for global polio eradication because oral polio vaccine can rarely cause poliomyelitis as it mutates and may fail to provide adequate immunity in immunocompromised populations However IPV is unaffordable for many developing countries Intradermal IPV shows promise as a means to decrease the effective dose and cost of IPV but prior studies all using 20 of the standard dose used in intramuscular IPV resulted in inferior antibody randomly assigned 231 adults with human immunodeficiency virus infection at a ratio of to receive 40 of the standard dose of IPV intradermally 20 of the standard dose intradermally the full standard dose intramuscularly or 40 of the standard dose intramuscularly Intradermal vaccination was done using the NanoPass MicronJet600 microneedle immunity was 87 90 and 66 against poliovirus serotypes 1 2 and 3 respectively After vaccination antibody titers increased a median of Vaccine response to 40 of the standard dose administered intradermally was comparable to that of the standard dose of IPV administered intramuscularly and resulted in higher although not significantly antibody titers Intradermal administration had higher a incidence of local side effects redness and itching but a similar incidence of systemic side effects and was preferred by study participants over intramuscular 60 reduction in the standard IPV dose without reduction in antibody titers is

vaccine OPV community circulation is increasingly important Mexico where OPV is given only during biannual national immunization weeks NIWs but where children receive inactivated polio vaccine IPV as part of their primary regimen provides a natural setting to study OPV community circulation Methods In total 216 children and household contacts in Veracruz Mexico were enrolled and monthly stool samples and questionnaires collected for 1 year 2501 stool samples underwent RNA extraction reverse transcription and polymerase chain reaction PCR to detect OPV serotypes 1 2 and 3 Results OPV was detected up to 7 months after an NIW but not at 8 months In total 35 of samples collected from children vaccinated the prior month but only 4 of other samples contained OPV Although each serotype was detected in similar proportions among OPV strains shed as a result of direct vaccination 87 of OPV acquired through community spread was serotype 2 P Conclusions Serotype 2 circulates longer and is transmitted more readily than serotypes 1 or 3 after NIWs in a Mexican community primarily vaccinated with IPV This may be part of the reason why most isolated cVDPV has been serotype 2 View details

prospective multicenter pediatric surveillance among 276 children with perinatally acquired from 1988 to 2009 All Center for Disease Control CDC mild moderate and severe otolaryngologic conditions were otolaryngologic conditions among the 276 children were 103 mild 50 moderate and 20 severe The majority and 50 of mild moderate and severe diagnoses respectively occurred in the first year of life with and 70 respectively occurring in the first 2 years of life The most frequent diagnoses were otitis media 21 and oropharyngeal thrush There was a temporal decline by cohort in prevalence of mild and moderate otolaryngologic diagnoses which was significant for mild conditions 90 cohort and 13 ART cohort P and moderate conditions 47 and 3 ART P our study many otolaryngologic conditions occur in the first 2 years of life Over 22 years of longitudinal follow up there was a significant decline in prevalence of otolaryngologic conditions by temporal cohorts when comparing and ART eras This finding supports early ART administration to decrease morbidity in infants and children as well as current US and World Health Organization guidelines to prevent early HIV disease progression View

2014 89 3 Abstract The objective was to integrate enhanced family planning FP and prevention of HIV transmission services in order to help Zimbabwean women achieve their desired family size and spacing as well as to maximize maternal and child pregnant women were enrolled into a SOC or intervention cohort based on study entry date and followed for 3 months postpartum The intervention cohort received education sessions aimed at increasing FP use and negotiation power Both groups received care from nurses with enhanced FP training Outcomes included FP use FP knowledge and HIV disclosure and were assessed with Fisher Exact Tests binomial tests and t intervention cohort reported increased control over condom use increased knowledge about IUDs increased relationship power and increased likelihood of disclosing their HIV status to a partner and having that partner disclose to them when compared to the SOC cohort reversible contraception LARC use in both groups increased from at baseline to 80 at 3 months postpartum p and sexual negotiation skills and knowledge as well as HIV disclosure increased significantly in the intervention cohort LARC uptake increased significantly in both the intervention and SOC cohorts likely because both groups received care from nurses with enhanced FP training Successful service integration models are needed to maximize health outcomes in environments this intervention is such a model that should be replicable in other settings in Africa and study provides a rigorously evaluated intervention to integrate FP education into and postnatal care for women and also to train providers on FP Results suggest that this intervention had significant effects on contraception use and communication with sexual partners This intervention should be

Children PEDIATRICS Maldonado Y Glode Bhatia J 2014 133 1 Abstract Sales of raw or unpasteurized milk and milk products are still legal in at least 30 states in the United States Raw milk and milk products from cows goats and sheep continue to be a source of bacterial infections attributable to a number of virulent pathogens including Listeria monocytogenes Campylobacter jejuni Salmonella species Brucella species and Escherichia coli O157 These infections can occur in both healthy and immunocompromised individuals including older adults infants young children and pregnant women and their unborn fetuses in whom infections and fetal miscarriage can occur Efforts to limit the sale of raw milk products have met with opposition from those who are proponents of the purported health benefits of consuming raw milk products which contain natural or unprocessed factors not inactivated by pasteurization However the benefits of these natural factors have not been clearly demonstrated in studies and therefore do not outweigh the risks of raw milk consumption Substantial data suggest that pasteurized milk confers equivalent health benefits compared with raw milk without the additional risk of bacterial infections The purpose of this policy statement was to review the risks of raw milk consumption in the United States and to provide evidence of the risks of infectious

Shetty Chumakov Nathoo Maldonado Y A 2013 208 4 Abstract Background With prolonged replication attenuated polioviruses used in oral polio vaccine OPV can mutate into poliovirus VDPV and cause poliomyelitis outbreaks Individuals with primary humoral immunodeficiencies can become chronically infected with vaccine poliovirus allowing it to mutate into VDPV iVDPV It is unclear if children perinatally infected with the human immunodeficiency virus HIV who have humoral as well as cellular immunodeficiencies might be sources of iVDPV Methods We conducted a prospective study collecting stool and blood samples at multiple time points from Zimbabwean infants receiving OPV according to the national schedule Nucleic acid extracted from stool was analyzed by polymerase chain reaction for OPV serotypes Results We analyzed 825 stool samples 285 samples from 92 children and 540 from 251 children Poliovirus shedding was similar after OPV doses but significantly higher in the versus uninfected children after OPV doses particularly within 42 days of an OPV dose independent of seroconversion status HIV infection was not associated with prolonged or persistent poliovirus shedding HIV infection was associated with significantly lower polio seroconversion rates Conclusions HIV infection is associated with decreased mucosal and humoral immune responses to OPV but not the prolonged viral shedding required to form iVDPV View details for DOI View details for Web of Science ID 000322412100017 View details for PubMedID 23661792 View details for PubMedCentralID PMC3719901

type of infant feeding may influence the risk of breastfeeding transmission of HIV The mechanisms of breast milk HIV transmission are poorly understood For mothers who are healthy and do not need combination antiretroviral therapy for their own health randomized controlled trials have proven that administration of extended maternal antiretroviral ARV prophylaxis or extended infant ARV prophylaxis can significantly reduce the risk of HIV transmission during breastfeeding Based on this evidence the World Health Organization WHO published new guidance in 2010 on the use of ARVs for treating pregnant women and preventing HIV transmission PMTCT Although remarkable advances have occurred in prevention of postnatal transmission during breastfeeding using antiretroviral strategies a

literature VACCINE Nelson Janssen Troy Maldonado Y 2012 30 2 Abstract Oral polio vaccine OPV will likely be insufficient to completely eradicate polio due to its propensity to mutate into neurovirulent forms and its inability to produce adequate immunity in certain areas of the world Inactivated polio vaccine IPV a killed vaccine which therefore can not mutate may be more effective than OPV in certain populations and will likely be required for global polio eradication However the high cost of IPV is prohibitive in many areas of the world Intradermal administration has the potential to lower the dose and thus the cost of IPV This article reviews the clinical studies to date on intradermal fractional dose polio vaccination We conclude that intradermal IPV vaccination shows potential as a means to reduce the cost and increase the ease of administration of IPV but that additional research is needed to determine the optimal fractional dose timing and role of adjuvants in intradermal IPV vaccination as well as the clinical significance of different antibody titers above the threshold for seroconversion View details for DOI View details for PubMedID

hospitalizations for pyelonephritis from 1985 to 2006 Multivariable logistic regression was performed to identify factors associated with admission for total of children were hospitalized for pyelonephritis in California from 1985 to 2006 The overall rate of hospitalization for pyelonephritis increased by greater than 80 from 17 per children in the California population in 1985 to 31 per in 2005 This change was primarily due to the nearly ninefold increase in pyelonephritis hospitalizations observed in children younger than 1 year from 28 per in 1985 to 238 per in 2005 Among children younger than 1 year males without private insurance and of nonwhite race had increased odds of hospitalization while females with private insurance and of Asian race had increased odds of hospitalization compared with nonprivate insurance and white race significant increase in hospital admissions for pyelonephritis primarily in children younger than 1 year occurred in California between 1985 and 2006 Further studies are needed to establish the cause of this striking increase and to determine why certain pediatric populations are at increased risk for hospitalization View

Polin Brady Bernstein Byington Edwards Fisher Glode Jackson Keyserling Kimberlin Maldonado Y Orenstein Schutze Willoughby Papile Cummings Baley Bhutani Carlo Kumar Polin Tan Wang Watterberg 2011 128 3 Abstract The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC guidelines for the prevention of perinatal group B streptococcal GBS disease were initially published in 1996 The American Academy of Pediatrics AAP also published a policy statement on this topic in 1997 In 2002 the CDC published revised guidelines that recommended universal antenatal GBS screening the AAP endorsed these guidelines and published recommendations based on them in the 2003 Red Book Since then the incidence of GBS disease in neonates has decreased by an estimated 80 However in 2010 GBS disease remained the leading cause of neonatal sepsis The CDC issued revised guidelines in 2010 based on evaluation of data generated after 2002 These revised and comprehensive guidelines which have been endorsed by the AAP reaffirm the major prevention strategy universal antenatal GBS screening and intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis for and women and include new recommendations for laboratory methods for identification of GBS colonization during pregnancy algorithms for screening and intrapartum prophylaxis for women with preterm labor and premature rupture of membranes updated prophylaxis recommendations for women with a penicillin allergy and a revised algorithm for the care of newborn infants The purpose of this policy statement is to review and discuss the differences between the 2002 and 2010 CDC guidelines

Recommendations for Use of Quadrivalent and Monovalent Varicella Vaccines in Children PEDIATRICS Brady Bernstein Byington Edwards Fisher Glode Jackson Keyserling Kimberlin Maldonado Y Orenstein Schutze Willoughby 2011 128 3 Abstract Two vaccines are licensed for use in the United States monovalent varicella vaccine Varivax Merck Co Inc West Point PA and quadrivalent vaccine MMRV ProQuad Merck Co Inc It is estimated from postlicensure data that after vaccination at 12 through 23 months of age 7 to 9 febrile seizures occur per children who receive the MMRV and 3 to 4 febrile seizures occur per children who receive the MMR and varicella vaccines administered concurrently but at separate sites Thus 1 additional febrile seizure is expected to occur per approximately 2300 to 2600 children 12 to 23 months old vaccinated with the MMRV when compared with separate MMR and varicella vaccine administration The period of risk for febrile seizures is from 5 through 12 days after receipt of the vaccine s No increased risk of febrile seizures is seen among patients 4 to 6 years of age receiving MMRV Febrile seizures do not predispose to epilepsy or neurodevelopmental delays later in life and are not associated with health impairment The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that either MMR and varicella vaccines separately or the MMRV be used for the first dose of measles mumps rubella and varicella vaccines administered at 12 through 47 months of age For the first dose of measles mumps rubella and varicella vaccines administered at ages 48 months and older and for dose 2 at any age 15 months to 12 years use of MMRV generally is preferred over separate injections of MMR and varicella vaccines View details for DOI View details for Web of Science ID

revert to neurovirulence and cause paralytic poliomyelitis In individual vaccinees it can acquire specific revertant point mutations leading to paralytic poliomyelitis VAPP With longer replication OPV can mutate into poliovirus VDPV which causes poliomyelitis outbreaks similar to those caused by wild poliovirus After wild poliovirus eradication safely phasing out vaccination will likely require global use of inactivated polio vaccine IPV until cessation of OPV circulation Mexico where children receive routine IPV but where OPV is given biannually during national immunization days NIDs provides a natural setting to study the duration of OPV circulation in a population primarily vaccinated with IPV We developed a PCR assay to detect and distinguish revertant and nonrevertant OPV serotype 1 and from RNA extracted directly from stool and sewage Stool samples from 124 children and 8 sewage samples from Orizaba Veracruz Mexico collected 6 to 13 weeks after a NID were analyzed Revertant was found in stool at 7 and 9 weeks and nonrevertant and were found in stool from two children 10 weeks after the NID Revertant and nonrevertant and were detected in sewage at 6 and 13 weeks after the NID Our PCR assay was able to detect small amounts of OPV in both stool and sewage and to distinguish nonrevertant and revertant serotypes and demonstrated that OPV continues to circulate at

Mutima Maldonado Y A 2011 23 7 Abstract women living in rural areas often have considerably less access to care than their urban and suburban counterparts In much of the USA little is known about HIV care among rural populations This study elucidated barriers to care for rural women in California Methods included retrospective structured interviews conducted with 64 women living in rural areas and receiving HIV care at 11 California healthcare facilities Facilities were randomly sampled and all female patients seeking care at those facilities during a specified time period were eligible The most commonly cited barriers to accessing care included physical health problems that prevented travel to care lack of transportation and lack of ability to navigate the healthcare system Being compared to being either married or single was associated with reporting physical health as a barrier to care being unemployed or having to travel minutes compared to less than 31 or greater than 90 were both associated with transportation as a barrier and speaking English rather than Spanish was associated with reporting difficulty navigating the system women reported difficulty in traveling to appointments Overall 24 women missed an HIV medical appointment in the previous period primarily due to their physical health and transportation limitations Physical health and transportation problems were both the major barriers to accessing health services and the primary reasons for missing HIV care appointments among this population of women living in rural areas Providing transportation

factors known to affect care receipt specifically maternal age educational attainment parity insurance geographical region of residence and maternal place of birth In contrast Asian women n received care closer to that of the White reference group OR 95 CIs Among Pacific Islanders Samoans OR 95 CIs were at particular risk of inadequate care compared to other PI Islander women received less adequate prenatal care than women of other groups The common practice of combining Asians and Pacific Islanders into a single category may mask needs in the Pacific Islander community Therefore in

third of neonatal deaths are related to infections Infections also account for 80 of deaths in the postneonatal period through 5 years of age There are several viral and parasitic infections which produce fetal and neonatal morbidity and mortality Neonatal infections occur during one or more perinatal periods in utero congenital intrapartum during labor and delivery and early or late postpartum Here the term perinatal refers to all of these stages of fetal or neonatal infections The mechanisms of perinatal viral and parasitic infections vary depending on the specific pathogen however all begin with maternal infection Following maternal infection organisms may produce indirect placental infection with or without fetal infection direct fetal or neonatal infection or primary maternal

shedding patterns we previously used the multistep method of mutant analysis by PCR and enzyme cleavage MAPREC This involves conventional reverse to detect OPV3 followed by a restriction digest to quantify position 472 reversion PCR detects and quantifies nucleic acid as PCR occurs and avoids postreaction processing The goal of this study was to compare a PCR method to MAPREC stool samples from Mexican OPV recipients underwent the reverse step of MAPREC and PCR PCR identified 23 more samples than conventional reverse When reversion was compared the revertant proportion RP defined as the percentage of revertants in a sample differed by or in 84 samples The four samples differing by 10 were obtained within 5 days of OPV administration The PCR assay identified samples with an RP of or with 94 sensitivity and 86 specificity compared to MAPREC The mean difference in RP between the two methods was 95 confidence interval to PCR methods reliably detect OPV3 and reversion estimates correlate more consistently with MAPREC when OPV3 reversion rates are high Detecting mutations by PCR is rapid and efficient and can be useful in monitoring ongoing global polio eradication efforts

antiretroviral drug toxicity 15th International AIDS Conference Wells Shetty Stranix Chipato Nyoni Mateta Maldonado LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS WILKINS 2006 Abstract HIV prevention trials in Africa use the US National Institutes of Health Division of AIDS DAIDS grading scale to monitor hematologic toxicity A recent study of nevirapine prophylaxis given for 6 months in Zimbabwean infants reported several cases of relative neutropenia in clinically well infants raising concerns of drug toxicity However the DAIDS tables are based on normal blood counts for white infants although there is evidence that black African infants may have lower absolute neutrophil counts ANCs than white infants To establish normal hematologic values in black Zimbabwean infants and to quantify the apparent prevalence of relative neutropenia in this population we evaluated healthy infants born to women at birth 10 days 6 weeks 3 and 4 months of life A physical examination and blood count were performed at each visit and an HIV test was performed at the final visit The ANC values were graded using the DAIDS table A total of 145 healthy term infants satisfied the inclusion criteria The mean ANC values for Zimbabwean infants were less than half of the corresponding standard values at all 5 time points P Using the DAIDS table in use at the time that the blood was collected 57 of these healthy infants had relative neutropenia of any grade at birth followed by 29 at day 10 53 at 6 weeks 32 at 3 months and 37 at 4 months of life Our data indicate that relative neutropenia exists in healthy black Zimbabwean infants The guidelines for identifying toxicity were changed in December 2004 However even by the new DAIDS tables 43 23 24 42 and 43 of these healthy babies had relative neutropenia at the time of the 5 visits Future HIV prevention and treatment trials in Africa should use normal hematologic values derived from African infants to avoid the overestimation of antiretroviral drug toxicity

agreed to blinded HIV testing but did not opt for VCT The responses to questionnaires on infant feeding practices of and women who knew and did not know their HIV status at day 1 and week 4 postpartum were compared We found that women who did not learn their status breastfed their infants less introduced supplementary foods sooner and planned to wean their babies earlier compared to other women p p NS women more frequently reported a prior history of infant death and symptoms compared to women We conclude that women who did not know their status made incorrect decisions with respect to infant feeding These women may have suspected themselves to be and consequently underfed their infants or because these women were more symptomatic may have been less likely to breastfeed decreased intake may increase the risk for malnutrition Knowledge of HIV status may influence infant feeding decisions and reveal an urgent need to address infant feeding practices of pregnant women in Zimbabwe View

Immunization Gans DeHovitz Forghani Beeler Maldonado Arvin ELSEVIER SCI 2003 Abstract Evaluations of neutralizing antibody responses in and infants given measles or mumps vaccine indicated that infants had diminished humoral immune responses associated with passive antibody effects but also had an intrinsic deficiency in antiviral antibody production which was independent of passive antibody effects In contrast lower neutralizing antibody titers in were related only to passive antibody effects Measles and proliferation and IFNgamma production were induced by vaccination at 6 9 or 12 months regardless of passive neutralizing antibodies or age These observations suggest a need to refine concepts about passive antibody interference and primary vaccine failure taking into account the sensitization of antiviral which occurs in the presence of passive antibodies and is observed in infants who do not develop active humoral immunity A second dose of measles vaccine given at months enhanced antiviral responses to measles in infants who were vaccinated at 6 or 9 months and produced higher seroconversion rates Since immunity is elicited under the cover of passive antibodies the youngest infants benefit from the synergistic protection mediated by maternal antibodies and their own capacity to develop sensitized antiviral which prime for subsequent exposures to the viral antigens Conceptually maternal immunization approaches with vaccines that can be given to women of age before pregnancy or that are safe for administration during pregnancy should enhance passive antibody protection Rather than being detrimental to infant adaptive immune responses maternal vaccination can be coupled effectively with vaccine regimens that elicit priming of antiviral immune

against measles at the youngest age possible has the potential to reduce morbidity and mortality The ability of infants at 6 9 or 12 months to respond to measles and mumps vaccines was evaluated by measuring T cell proliferation production and neutralizing antibody titers before and after vaccination Infants in all age groups had equivalent cellular immune responses to measles or mumps viruses with or without passive antibodies when immunized In contrast infants without passive antibodies had low geometric mean titers of antibody to measles or mumps viruses and low seroconversion rates Geometric mean titers of antibody to measles virus increased if infants were revaccinated at 12 months infants had limited humoral responses to paramyxovirus vaccines whereas cellular immunity was equivalent to that of older infants T cell responses can be established by immunization with these live attenuated virus vaccines during the first year despite the presence of passive antibodies View

Pediatrics Peter des Eickhoff Fine Galvin LEVINE Maldonado Y Marcuse MONATH Osborn Plotkin Poland Quinlisk Smith Sokol Soland Williamson Breiman 1999 104 4 Abstract Although the vaccine research and development network in the United States remains vibrant its continued success requires maintaining harmonious interaction among its many components Changing one component is likely to affect the system overall An examination of case studies of the development of selected vaccines would allow an examination of the network as a whole This article presents conclusions drawn from the case study review development of vaccines is a process requiring years of commitment from a network of scientists and a continuum of regulatory and manufacturing entities We undertook this work to shed light on how well the vaccine development system in the United States National Vaccine Advisory Committee examined the research and development pathways of several vaccines that reached licensure expeditiously hepatitis B vaccine Haemophilus influenzae type b conjugate vaccines some that became licensed only after considerable delay oral typhoid Ty21a vaccine varicella vaccine some that are at the point of imminent or recent licensure reassortant Rhesus rotavirus vaccine which was licensed by the Food and Drug Administration on August 30 1998 or near submission for licensure intranasal cold adapted influenza vaccine and one for which clinical development is slow because of hurdles that must be overcome respiratory syncytial virus vaccines common themes emerged from the reviews of these vaccine case histories the expediting influence of a strong scientific base and rationale the need for firm quantitation of disease burden and clear identification of target populations the critical role played by individuals or teams who act as champions to overcome the inevitable obstacles availability of relevant animal models reagents and standardized assays to measure immune response the absolute requirement for well designed meticulously executed clinical trials of vaccine safety immunogenicity and efficacy postlicensure measurements of the public health impact of the vaccine and a track record of the vaccine safety and acceptance with use and the critical need for international collaborations to evaluate vaccines against diseases of global importance that are rare in the United States eg typhoid fever It was clear that the critical from bench scale to pilot lots and then to production which depends on a small group of highly trained individuals is often a particularly vulnerable point in the development fundamental lesson learned is that within the varied and comprehensive US vaccine development infrastructure multiple and rather distinct paths can be followed to reach vaccine licensure The National Vaccine Advisory Committee review process should be conducted periodically in the future to ascertain that the US vaccine development network which has been enormously productive heretofore and has played a leadership role globally is adapting appropriately to ensure that new safe and efficacious vaccines become available in a timely manner View details

the addition of recombinant human enhanced production by PBMC stimulated with measles Ag but infant T cells released significantly less than adult T cells under this condition Of particular interest the presence of passive Abs to measles had no effect on the specific T cell proliferation or production after measles stimulation Cellular immunity to measles infection and vaccination may be limited in infants compared with adults as a result of less effective and production in response to measles Ags These effects were not exaggerated in younger infants compared with effects in infants who were immunized at 12 mo In summary infant T cells were primed with measles Ag despite the presence of passive Abs but their adaptive immune responses were limited compared with those of adults View details

Parsonnet J 1999 48 4 Abstract In Chiapas Mexico diarrheal disease causes the majority of all deaths in children under the age of five Treatment of childhood diarrhea may be influenced by local beliefs and cultural practices Few studies have attempted to quantitatively evaluate health seeking behavior HSB for diarrheal diseases in indigenous communities while controlling for potential confounding factors such as parental education or socioeconomic status A rapid ethnographic survey was conducted in Nabenchauc Chiapas to determine hypothetical HSB patterns for each of four major types of childhood diarrhea Additionally we examined the actual HSB for the last episode of childhood diarrheal illness within the household One hundred households participated in the survey 94 households with children 5 years old reported a mean of diarrheal episodes during the preceding month Households reported using a mean of types of remedies Oral rehydration therapy ORT was used in 2 of the 368 HSB patterns elicited for the four types of diarrhea HSB patterns utilized an eclectic combination of traditional allopathic local and distant health care options A mean of health care options were reported for each diarrheal type the local grocery store was reported in 245 67 of the hypothetical HSB patterns and as a first option in 199 54 Maternal paternal education had little impact on hypothetical HSB Households with lower SES were more likely to report using local grocery stores as a first option and were less likely to use options outside the village The rapid ethnographic survey approach allows for assessment of changes in the approach to health care option utilization in cultures incorporating new health care paradigms Public health interventions targeting local stores may lead to increased use of ORT thereby potentially reducing early morbidity and mortality due to childhood diarrhea View details for Web of Science ID 000077986300005 View

infection in expression on peripheral blood neutrophils was determined by flow cytometry of whole blood samples Blood ml was obtained from a convenience sample of infants admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit stained with antibodies detecting CD11b and CD15 chilled and analyzed within 8 hours Blood for culture blood counts and protein CRP determination was obtained simultaneously Subjects were grouped on the basis of culture results and clinical signs and investigators were blinded to CD11b 106 subjects seven had positive bacterial or viral cultures confirmed infection 17 had clinical signs of infection but negative cultures suspected infection and 82 had negative cultures and no clinical signs no infection Neutrophil CD11b was elevated in all infants with confirmed infection 94 with suspected infection and none with no infection The negative and positive predictive values sensitivity and specificity were 100 99 96 and 100 respectively for diagnosis of neonatal infection at initial evaluation CD11b levels correlated with peak CRP r2 p however CD11b was elevated at the time of admission in all five infants with proven bacterial infection whereas CRP was

large number of perinatally infected Pediatric Spectrum of Disease PSD project coordinated by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC has conducted active surveillance for HIV disease since 1988 in seven geographic regions PSD data are collected from medical and social service records every 6 months through practitioners at each participating hospital clinic We analyzed data from perinatally children born between 1982 and 1993 The natural history of HIV disease was divided into five progressive stages using the clinical categories in the CDC 1994 pediatric HIV classification system stage N no signs or symptoms stage A mild signs or symptoms stage B moderate signs or symptoms stage C severe signs or symptoms and stage D death A Markov model was fitted to the PSD data To compare the estimates from the PSD project with the published estimates we also fitted an alternative Markov model using acquired immunodeficiency syndrome AIDS 1987 case definition in place of stage C and also calculated standard total of 2148 perinatally children were included in the analysis The estimated mean times spent in each stage were N 10 months A 4 months B 65 months and C 34 months We estimated that a child born with HIV infection has a 50 95 confidence interval CI 40 chance of severe signs or symptoms developing by 5 years of age and a 75 95 CI 68 chance of surviving to 5 years of age For a child in stage B there is a 60 95 CI 49 chance of severe signs or symptoms developing within the next 5 years and a 65 95 CI 56 chance of surviving 5 more years The estimated mean time from birth to stage C was 95 CI years and the estimated mean survival time from birth was 95 CI years From the alternative Markov model the estimated mean time from birth to AIDS was 95 CI modeling using the revised pediatric classification system allowed us to describe the natural history of HIV disease in children before diagnosis of AIDS On average children progress to moderate symptoms in the second year of life and then remain moderately symptomatic for more than half of their expected lives underscoring their need for clinical care before the onset of AIDS The results from the Markov

the impact of disease patterns on survival using method and Cox proportional hazards median age at diagnosis was 13 months for children with perinatally acquired infection and months for children infected through other routes of transmission Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia and lymphoid interstitial pneumonia were the most common conditions among perinatal cases whereas the disease patterns observed among nonperinatal cases were more varied The median postdiagnosis survival for the cohort was 26 time did not differ significantly by sex or route of transmission Respiratory candidiasis and

phenotype In children the naive subset is present at high frequencies whereas memory cells are virtually absent Previous studies have shown that the overall number of CD8 T cells does not decrease in children In studies here we use multiparameter flow cytometry to distinguish naive from memory CD8 T cells based on expression of CD11a CD45RA and CD62L With this methodology we show that within the CD8 T cell population the naive subset decreases markedly 190 370 P or and that there is a reciprocal increase in memory cells such that the total CD8 T cell counts remained unchanged 800 860 P or In addition we show that for children the naive CD8 T cell and total CD4 T cell counts correlate chi 2 P or This correlated loss suggests that the loss of naive CD8 T cells in HIV infection may contribute to the defects in immunity which become progressively worse as the HIV disease progresses and CD4 counts decrease View details for Web of Science ID A1995QW20500014 View details for

CLINICAL GASTROENTEROLOGY Maldonado Y Yolken 1990 4 3 Abstract Since their discovery in the 1970s the human rotaviruses have been recognized as the most important cause of acute infectious gastroenteritis among infants and children worldwide Rotavirus has been found to infect almost all mammalian and avian species tested and is primarily a disease of the young In humans rotavirus is the most frequent gastrointestinal pathogen in infants and children less than 2 years of age In developing countries the attack rate peaks at 6 months of age whereas in developed areas of the world the virus is most commonly found among children months of age Rotavirus displays a marked seasonality in temperate climates with the number of cases peaking in the colder winter months In tropical climates this seasonality is not as apparent and infection may occur year round Symptoms of rotavirus infection are and include vomiting and diarrhoea occasionally accompanied by a low grade fever Dehydration is more common with rotavirus infection than with most bacterial pathogens and is the most common cause of death related to rotavirus infection Treatment is and includes the use of oral rehydration therapy especially in developing countries where malnutrition is common Strategies for the prevention of rotavirus infection are dependent on advances in the understanding of the molecular biology of the rotavirus The genetic structure of the virus has been extensively studied and a number of the structural proteins have been identified The neutralization antigens located on VP4 and VP7 may be important in conferring immunity to rotavirus in vivo Two and several reassortant rotavirus vaccines are currently being evaluated in field studies and a number of other candidate vaccines are

INTESTINAL REVIEWS OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES Yolken Maldonado Kinney VONDERFECHT 1990 12 Abstract Viral infections of the gastrointestinal tract remain a major problem during the neonatal period In addition to causing acute diarrhea rotaviruses and other enteric viruses may be involved in the pathogenesis of necrotizing enterocolitis and other neonatal enteric diseases There are several potential methods for the prevention and treatment of gastrointestinal viral infections Antiviral immunoglobulins might be used to inhibit intestinal viral replication Since only small concentrations of serum immunoglobulins are present at mucosal surfaces oral administration of immunoglobulins might be utilized to maximize antiviral efficacy Alternatively inhibitors of specific glycoproteins of binding might be used to prevent the productive infection of intestinal epithelial cells In addition since many enteric viruses require proteolytic enzymes for protein cleavage protease inhibitors may prove effective for inhibition of intestinal viral replication At this time these methods have proven useful for the inhibition of rotavirus infection in experimental animals The successful application of these and other methods for the prevention of enteric infections in humans might substantially reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with enteric diseases in neonates View

Vaccine programs have evaluated animal rotavirus strains that are attenuated in humans but antigenically similar to some human strains Whether a single vaccine strain can elicit protective immunity in humans to rotaviruses of the same or different serotypes is an important question in determining vaccine efficacy We used characterized monoclonal antibodies directed at VP7 in a competitive immunoassay to measure immune responses to serotypes 1 2 and 3 in sera of children who received a candidate rotavirus vaccine Antibodies to serotype 3 were detected in 72 of sera samples and to serotype 1 and 2 in only 11 each Also a monoclonal antibody which neutralizes three serotypically distinct strains of rotavirus was used to detect the presence of similar antibodies in 56 of the test
