on the type of incontinence and presumed etiology Artificial Urinary Sphincter AUS is the preferred treatment for men with moderate to severe stress urinary incontinence SUI after RP Male slings are an acceptable approach for men with mild to moderate SUI Much discussion centers on the definition of moderate SUI Injectable agents have a poor success rate in men with SUI Options for recurrent SUI due to urethral atrophy after AUS implantation include changing the pressure balloon downsizing the cuff and increasing the amount of fluid in the system Infection erosion demand surgical removal or

Reduction Efforts Trial FEMALE PELVIC MEDICINE AND RECONSTRUCTIVE SURGERY Davenport Sokol Comiter Elliott 2018 24 4 Abstract Cystoceles may cause urethral obstruction by altering the vesicourethral angle Restoration of normal anatomy after pelvic organ prolapse POP repair can relieve this obstruction but may unmask stress urinary incontinence SUI The association between the severity of cystocele and developing de novo SUI after prolapse repair however is poorly understood We hypothesized that in women undergoing prolapse repair increasing degrees of bladder prolapse would be associated with increasing rates of postoperative de novo performed a secondary analysis of the Colpopexy and Urinary Reduction Efforts CARE trial data Using the control arm women undergoing prolapse repair without a prophylactic SUI procedure we identified de novo SUI using a composite definition based on original trial criteria We performed logistic regression to evaluate the relationship between the degree of cystocele and the development of new the 164 women who underwent abdominal sacrocolpopexy alone 54 developed de novo postoperative SUI Stratifying by the degree of anterior prolapse point Ba we found a linear increase in the rate of SUI with worsening preoperative cystocele The incidence of de novo SUI based on the POP Quantification stage of anterior prolapse was and for stage 2 early stage 3 and advanced stage 3 or stage 4 respectively Point Ba was found to be significantly associated with de novo SUI on both univariate odds ratio P and multivariate analysis odds ratio P incidence of de novo SUI after prolapse repair directly correlates to the degree of cystocele on preoperative examination This simple yet novel relationship should further guide discussions about potential postoperative

Elliott Dallas Zlatev Comiter Crew Shem 2018 Abstract PURPOSE In many individuals with spinal cord injury a return of volitional bladder voiding is considered more important than regaining motor function Recently a predictive model using only composite bilateral lower extremity motor scores for levels range 0 to 50 was proposed by the EMSCI European Multicenter Study about Spinal Cord Injury group The model showed exceptional predictive power with a AUC of We sought to further validate the EMSCI model in a national spinal cord injury AND METHODS We created models of volitional voiding using the United States NSCID National Spinal Cord Injury Database for 2007 to 2016 In addition to testing lower extremity motor scores we evaluated other patient variables that we hypothesized might affect volitional Volitional voiding was present in of the cohort of individuals at followup While younger age female gender increased sacral sparing improved AIS American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale classification and a more caudal sensory level predicted volitional voiding lower extremity motor scores were most predictive AUC Adding the other patient characteristics did little to improve model performance full model AUC Further analysis of the predictive power of lower extremity motor scores suggested that while the AUC appeared to decrease in persons who were most likely to void volitionally the performance of the predictive model remained outstanding with a combined AIS C and D AUC of Our study verifies the validity of the EMSCI predictive model of volitional voiding after spinal cord injury The differing performance of lower extremity motor scores in various AIS classifications should be noted View details for PubMedID 29458066 SACRAL NEUROMODULATION TINED LEAD

factors including history of prior incontinence surgery or radiation treatment bladder contractility severity of leakage and patient expectations Most patients choose to avoid a mechanical device opting for the male sling over the artificial urinary sphincter The modern male sling has continued to evolve with respect to device design and surgical technique Various types of slings address sphincteric incompetence via different mechanisms of action The recommended surgery however must be individualized to the patient based on degree of incontinence detrusor contractility and urethral compliance A thorough urodynamic evaluation is indicated for the majority of patients and the recommendation for an artificial urinary sphincter a transobturator sling or a quadratic sling will depend on urodynamic findings and the patient particular preference As advancements in this field evolve and our understanding of the pathophysiology of incontinence and mechanisms of various devices

most effective treatment for postprostatectomy incontinence Over the past two decades this surgery has evolved with respect to both operative technique and sling design and various devices are now available that have different mechanisms of action such as the artificial urinary sphincter retroluminal sling or quadratic sling The choice of device however should be individualized according to the circumstances of each patient The optimal surgical treatment depends on a variety of factors including the degree of urine leakage as assessed by incontinence pad weight test results bladder contractility urethral compliance history of radiation exposure or prior incontinence surgery and patient preference given the choice most patients opt for a sling procedure over an artificial sphincter to avoid implantation of a mechanical device Athorough urodynamic evaluation is therefore necessary for the majority of patients An artificial urinary sphincter retroluminal sling or

33 8 Abstract Local systems exist within the genitourinary tract specifically in the bladder and urethra Experimental data suggest that angiotensin receptor blockade with either angiotensin converting enzyme ACE inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers ARBs decreases both detrusor overactivity and urethral sphincter tone leading to decreased urge incontinence UUI and increased stress urinary incontinence SUI This has not been examined in a human from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey NHANES was accessed for the years Multivariate logistic regression was used for studied females and males who met inclusion criteria Use of ACE inhibitors or ARBs was not associated with a change in SUI in either men or women In men use of an ACE inhibitor or ARB was associated with a statistically significant decrease in UUI monthly or any urge incontinence A similar albeit trend was also seen for daily and weekly UUI Other antihypertensive medications diuretics blockers were not associated with a decrease in UUI In subanalysis duration of ACE inhibitor or ARB use did not alter the strength of the effect on UUI nor did an elevated prostate specific antigen PSA level used as a surrogate for bladder outlet obstruction due to benign prostatic hypertrophy ACE inhibitor and ARB use did not affect UUI rates in women though did show a trend for improvement in nulliparous women

prolapse and incontinence procedure epidemiology by utilizing both inpatient and outpatient data INTERNATIONAL UROGYNECOLOGY JOURNAL Elliott Rhoads Comiter Chen Sokol 2013 24 11 Abstract INTRODUCTION AND HYPOTHESIS The epidemiologic description of pelvic organ prolapse POP and stress urinary incontinence SUI procedures is documented in several large studies using national database cohorts These studies however may underestimate the number of procedures performed because they only capture procedures performed in either the inpatient or outpatient settings alone We present a complete annual description of all inpatient and outpatient surgeries for POP and SUI in California METHODS We reviewed a record of all inpatient and outpatient POP and SUI surgeries performed in California in 2008 using data from the Office of Statewide Health Planning OSHPD RESULTS In 2008 and women in California underwent POP and SUI procedures respectively Of these and were performed in an outpatient setting The rates of POP and SUI were and per US females respectively This correlates to POP and SUI procedures per year nationally Vaginal apical suspensions were more common in those undergoing surgery as an inpatient vs The use of mesh to augment prolapse repairs was similar inpatient vs outpatient SUI procedures performed in the outpatient setting were more likely to be performed as procedures vs respectively CONCLUSIONS In California 16 of POP and 44 of SUI procedures were performed in an outpatient surgical setting in 2008 Epidemiologic studies of POP and SUI should account for the fact that a substantial number of repairs are performed in the outpatient setting in order to achieve accuracy View details for DOI View details for PubMedID 23640007 To sling or not to sling at time of

occult stress urinary incontinence SUI in those undergoing abdominal sacrocolpopexy ASC METHODS Using modeling we compared over a 1 year time period of three treatment approaches 1 ASC alone with deferred option for MUS 2 ASC with universal concomitant MUS and 3 preoperative urodynamic study UDS for selective MUS Using published data we modeled probabilities of SUI after ASC with or without MUS the predictive value of UDS to detect occult SUI and the likelihood of complications after MUS Costs were derived from Medicare 2010 reimbursement rates The main outcome modeled was incremental cost effectiveness ratio ICER per life years QALY gained In addition to analysis sensitivity analyses were performed RESULTS In our model universally performing MUS at the time of ASC was the most approach with an incremental cost per QALY gained of 2867 when compared to performing ASC alone Preoperative UDS was more costly and less effective than universally performing intraoperative MUS The of ASC MUS was robust to sensitivity analysis with a ratio consistently below per QALY CONCLUSIONS Universal concomitant MUS is the most prophylaxis strategy for occult SUI in women undergoing ASC The

cystoceles may recur if associated apical prolapse is not corrected However to date the anatomical relationship of apical prolapse with respect to cystocele has been incompletely reported We present the predictive value of a cystocele for clinically significant vaginal apical retrospectively reviewed the records of all new patient visits to a urogynecology clinic in a period Women with a point Ba value of or greater stage 2 cystocele and above were included in analysis Predictive values of clinically significant apical prolapse defined as point C or greater were calculated and stratified by cystocele total of 385 women were included in study Point Ba was the leading edge of prolapse in of cases The position of Ba strongly correlated with that of the vaginal apex Spearman ρ p Overall of patients had a point C of or greater The finding of clinically significant apical prolapse increased significantly with increasing Ba values Of patients with stage 2 3 and 4 cystocele point C was or greater in 42 85 and 100 finding of stage 2 or greater cystocele is highly suggestive of clinically significant apical vaginal descent to or greater Furthermore as cystocele stage increases the

does the study add Angiotensin II is the main effector peptide in the bladder local system This experiment demonstrates the role of this local system with respect to bladder outlet To determine if treatment with an angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonist losartan can prevent the structural and functional changes that occur in a mouse model of bladder outlet obstruction BOO mice underwent partial urethral obstruction for 6 weeks Twelve mice were given oral losartan 10 and 12 were not Six mice served as unobstructed controls and six unobstructed mice were given oral losartan 10 to determine the effect of angiotensin II inhibition on the normal bladder Bladder capacity C detrusor pressure during voiding Pdet and volume at first contraction NVC1 as a percentage of C were recorded

Urethral Resistance JOURNAL OF UROLOGY Comiter Nitti Elliot Rhee 2012 187 2 Abstract Objective methods are essential for evaluating incontinence While symptom score and pad weight may be the most useful methods to evaluate preoperative vs postoperative continence neither is useful for guiding intraoperative sling tension The Virtue quadratic sling Coloplast Humlebaek Denmark is a new device for treating incontinence that combines a transobturator and prepubic surgical approach We examined urethral resistance by measuring retrograde leak point pressure during key portions of the total of 22 consecutive men who elected to undergo Virtue sling surgery were evaluated with retrograde leak point pressure before and during the surgery Retrograde leak point pressure was measured via perfusion sphincterometry at baseline after transobturator tensioning after prepubic tensioning and after transobturator and prepubic arms were secured in patient age was 70 years Mean baseline retrograde leak point pressure was cm water After transobturator tensioning mean retrograde leak point pressure increased to cm water After prepubic tensioning mean retrograde leak point pressure was and final retrograde leak point pressure after transobturator and prepubic fixation increased to cm water Each mean retrograde leak point pressure value was significantly higher than the preceding Virtue sling provides ventral urethral elevation using a transobturator approach and a long segment of urethral compression against the genitourinary diaphragm via a straightforward prepubic technique without the risks of bone screws or retropubic needle passage Transobturator and prepubic components of the quadratic fixation contributed to increasing urethral resistance as measured by intraoperative retrograde leak point pressure This quadratic technique has a potentially greater ability to provide urethral compression than does a purely perineal or transobturator sling View

2006 and 2010 Threshold values that is model variable values at which the most cost effective approach crosses over to an alternative approach were determined by testing model variables over realistic ranges using sensitivity analysis Hospital billing data were also evaluated to confirm our time was similar for robotic and open surgery 226 vs 221 minutes but postoperative length of stay differed significantly vs days p Base case analysis revealed an overall 10 cost savings for vs open sacrocolpopexy vs Tornado analysis suggested that the number of institutional robotic cases done annually length of stay and cost per hospitalization day in the postoperative period were the largest drivers of cost Analysis of our hospital billing data showed a similar trend with robotic surgery costing less than open approach to sacrocolpopexy can be equally or less costly than an open approach This depends on a sufficient institutional robotic case volume and a shorter postoperative stay for

incontinence Although the artificial urinary sphincter AUS remains a popular treatment option a decade worth of innovations have expanded the role of male sling surgery has an approximately success rate regardless of the degree of incontinence The male sling has a similar success rate in men with leakage but is less efficacious in those with severe incontinence A transobturator approach has simplified the procedure but appears best suited for men with milder degrees of incontinence A new quadratically fixed sling that achieves a broader area of urethral compression by combining a transobturator and suprapubic approach has recently been introduced with the aim of greater efficacy while maintaining the low morbidity of sling male sling and AUS are equally efficacious for the treatment of stress urinary incontinence The sling appears to have a lower risk of infection erosion and urethral atrophy The AUS remains the most efficacious treatment for severe stress urinary

reduced muscular hypertrophy and fibrosis with a median H E score of 3 vs 2 P and a median trichrome score of 3 vs 1 P mediates both functional and structural changes in the mouse bladder Six weeks of obstruction caused an increase in BC detrusor overactivity and voiding pressure and mediated an increase in bladder weight detrusor muscle hypertrophy and collagen deposition in the lamina propria and smooth muscle Treatment with 6 weeks of oral sildenafil beginning at the time of BOO prevented the increase in detrusor overactivity without affecting voiding pressures and prevented the increase in detrusor muscle hypertrophy and collagen deposition that otherwise occurred with BOO It appears therefore that sildenafil citrate acts on the bladder rather than on the outlet View details for DOI

using the transobturator approach and the superior extensions by a prepubic approach This procedure was offered to two men C and D with severe neurogenic intrinsic sphincter mean baseline MUCP in specimen A was 55 cmH2O and the RLPP 35 cmH2O after placing the sling the respective values increased to 75 and 70 cmH2O In specimen B the respective mean values were 56 and 50 cmH2O and after placing the sling were 82 and 75 cmH2O In patient C the RLPP increased from 17 cmH2O before surgery to 65 cmH2O afterward and in patient D from 20 to 70 cmH2O At the there was complete resolution of urinary incontinence in both Levera sling provides urethral compression against the perineal membrane using a straightforward approach and ventral elevation and compression of the bulbous urethra using the transobturator approach avoiding the risks associated with of bone screws and retropubic needle passage In our initial two patients stress incontinence was cured at 1 year of A term and a larger

Abstract Stress urinary incontinence in men is usually a result of intrinsic sphincter deficiency following prostate cancer surgery Active conservative management with fluid restriction medication management and pelvic floor exercises is indicated for the first 12 months If bothersome incontinence persists urodynamic evaluation is indicated in order to assess detrusor storage function contractility and sphincteric integrity Standard surgical options include urethral bulking agents artificial urinary sphincter AUS and male sling Periurethral injection of bulking agents is satisfactory in only a minority of patients leaving AUS and male sling as the most common surgical treatments In patients with severe urinary incontinence AUS seems to have a higher rate of success than the male sling Furthermore AUS is indicated in men with detrusor hypocontractility as adequate detrusor contractility is needed to overcome the fixed resistance of the sling In patients with milder levels of stress incontinence the two techniques have approximately equal efficacy in the term While current reports of the male sling are generally limited to years the infection erosion and revision rate for the male sling seem somewhat lower than that for the AUS in appropriately chosen patients View details for DOI View details for Web of Science ID 000250585500011 View details for

has been implicated in vascular congestion oedema and mice were divided into three treatment groups eight in each group that were autoimmunized with bladder homogenate to induce EAC One group received an AII type 1 receptor AT 1 antagonist one group an AII type 2 receptor AT 2 antagonist and one group remained untreated EAC A control and group were also included After 10 weeks bladders were removed sectioned and stained with haematoxylin and there was no thickening or adhesions in the bladders of the control or mice In five of seven surviving EAC bladders there were dense adhesions to surrounding peritoneal structures There were also adhesions and bladder thickening in all of the AT 2 mice though in a milder form but in only two of seven surviving AT 1 mice There was no inflammation or oedema in the sham and control groups All the EAC bladders were inflamed with submucosal oedema and urothelial detachment from the lamina propria In the AT 1 mice there was no inflammation or oedema By contrast all AT 2 mice had moderate inflammation and minor detachment of the urothelium from the lamina 1 receptor blockade ameliorated the inflammatory infiltration submucosal oedema and urothelial detachment associated with EAC in mice This was achieved to a lesser extent by AT 2 receptor blockade If some patients with IC have a pathophysiology similar to that

and recurrent incontinence can be quite difficult It is important that the urologic surgeon is well informed about the most common complications that are associated with sling surgery and how to best manage them In addition the management of recurrent incontinence following sling surgery should follow a stepwise approach with appropriate diagnostic studies conservative treatment if possible and surgery if necessary While sling surgery in the patient with urethral hypermobility is often straightforward reoperation for recurrent incontinence can be more technically challenging In the patient

suprapubic incision We describe this minimally invasive April 1998 to February 1999 85 women underwent an incisionless suburethral fascial sling procedure A transvaginal bone drill was used to place a bone anchor loaded with 1 prolene suture into the inferior aspect of the pubic bone on either side of the urethra A subepithelial tunnel was created at the level of the bladder neck A 2 x 7 cm segment of cadaveric fascia lata was placed through the subepithelial tunnel The sutures were passed through the fascia 5mm from either edge effectively creating a cm sling Finally the sutures are tied up to the pubic was via a questionnaire and patient interview Recurrent SUI was noted in 3 New onset urge incontinence was present in 5 Permanent urinary retention has not occurred in either group All procedures were performed on an outpatient basis and no operative complications results for the incisionless sling compare favorably with the long term results for the AVWS This minimally invasive approach has thus far not been associated with any significant complications Elimination of the vaginal and suprapubic incisions has not compromised efficacy and appears to reduce the incidence of

Abstract Teratomas with malignant transformation comprise up to 6 of metastatic teratomas The prognosis of patients with these tumors can vary considerably We delineate factors that may be related to prognosis in a cohort of men with teratoma with malignant analyzed pathological features treatment response recurrence time to recurrence subsequent followup and survival for 21 patients median age 28 years diagnosed with teratoma with malignant transformation during a period at our nongerm cell elements were present in the primary tumor in 11 cases 52 Of 18 patients with testicular primaries 17 94 presented with metastatic disease Despite aggressive treatment with surgery and chemotherapy 17 of 21 cases 81 recurred median time 6 months Overall 5 patients 24 died of disease median survival 23 months 5 24 are alive with metastases median followup 41 months and 11 52 have no evidence of disease median followup 50 months was substantially greater for 2 of 2 cases with a mediastinal origin 3 of 4 with rhabdomyosarcomatous differentiation and 5 of 6 with neural differentiation compared with the remainder of the cohort p with malignant transformation are usually metastatic at presentation have a high recurrence rate and are more aggressive than teratomas without malignant transformation Prognosis is especially poor for mediastinal teratomas with malignant transformation and for those with neural or rhabdomyosarcomatous differentiation Complete surgical resection of residual or recurrent disease appears to offer the best chance for prolonged survival View details for Web of Science

JOURNAL OF IMPOTENCE RESEARCH Comiter Sullivan Yalla Kifor I 1997 9 3 Abstract In extracavernosal vascular tissue smooth muscle tone is modulated by a balance between angiotensin II Ang II and nitric oxide NO We hypothesized that these substances also play an important role in regulating cavernosal smooth muscle contractility We therefore studied the in vitro effects of an Ang II receptor antagonist and a nitric oxide synthase NOS inhibitor on the contractile effects of Ang II phenylephrine and electrical field stimulation in canine corpus cavernosum Ang II caused a contraction of cavernosal smooth muscle which was inhibited by the Ang II receptor antagonist and augmented by NOS inhibition Contractions induced by phenylephrine or electrical stimulation were diminished by the Ang II receptor antagonist and augmented by NOS inhibition We conclude that Ang II plays an important role in modulating cavernosal smooth muscle tone and that the contractile effect of Ang II on cavernosal tissue is modulated by the local NO environment View details for Web of Science ID A1997XV62100005 View details for PubMedID 9315490 Urodynamic risk factors for renal dysfunction in men with obstructive and nonobstructive voiding dysfunction JOURNAL OF UROLOGY Comiter Sullivan Schacterle Cohen Yalla 1997 158 1 Abstract Urodynamic investigation of men with lower urinary tract symptoms usually attributed to benign prostatic hyperplasia often reveals bladder outlet obstruction detrusor instability diminished vesical compliance We investigated whether these urodynamic abnormalities alone or in combination contribute to renal total of 161 men with lower urinary tract symptoms was evaluated by urodynamics and outlet obstruction detrusor instability and decreased compliance 30 water or less were noted Serum blood urea nitrogen BUN and creatinine were measured Cases were categorized according to the urodynamic diagnosis Mean values of serum BUN and creatinine as well as the incidence of elevated BUN and creatinine were compared among the cohort 54 men 34 had elevated BUN and 19 12 had elevated serum creatinine No significant correlation was found between the degree of obstruction and BUN or creatinine level Mean serum BUN and creatinine and the incidence of abnormal laboratory tests did not significantly differ among those with outlet obstruction detrusor instability both conditions or neither condition However in patients with outlet obstruction and detrusor instability there was a significantly increased incidence of azotemia in the subgroup with diminished compliance 78 versus the subgroup with normal compliance 36 men with voiding dysfunction of a nonneurogenic etiology outlet obstruction with or without detrusor instability does not appear to be a risk factor for elevated BUN and creatinine However when decreased bladder compliance is associated with a combination of outlet obstruction and detrusor instability this risk is substantially increased View details for Web of Science ID A1997XC69200058 View details for PubMedID 9186351 Retrograde leak point pressure for evaluating postradical prostatectomy incontinence UROLOGY Comiter Sullivan Yalla 1997 49 2 Abstract To evaluate a technique of measuring the retrograde leak point pressure RLPP for assessing men with postradical prostatectomy stress urinary incontinence SUI measured RLPP in adult men by retrograde infusion of the distal urethra while simultaneously recording intraurethral pressure The reproducibility of this test and its dependence on urethral infusion rate bladder volume and anterior urethral catheter position were evaluated RLPP and abdominal leak point pressure ALPP measurements were performed in postradical prostatectomy patients RLPP was compared with ALPP and with severity of incontinence determined by pad RLPP measurements were not significantly different and did not change with bladder volume up to half capacity or with the location of the catheter in the anterior urethra The differences between RLPP measurements with infusion rates of 2 4 and 8 were also not significant men were evaluated 6 to 108 months after surgery Of these 22 81 demonstrated SUI Mean RLPP in men without SUI 14 cm H2O was significantly higher than in men with SUI 13 cm H2O P In men with SUI ALPP and RLPP were significantly correlated and ALPP 24 cm H2O was not significantly different from RLPP 13 cm H2O Pad use and RLPP were also significantly measurements are reproducible and simple to perform The pressure at which leakage occurs is easily identifiable as the plateau pressure RLPP correlates significantly with the lowest of multiple ALPP measurements in men with SUI This technique represents a reliable urodynamic alternative for evaluating men with postradical prostatectomy SUI View details for Web of Science ID A1997WH46700016 View details for PubMedID 9037285 Prediction of prostatic obstruction with a combination of isometric detrusor contraction pressure and maximum urinary flow rate UROLOGY Comiter Sullivan Schacterle Yalla 1996 48 5 Abstract Because isometric detrusor contraction pressure Piso increases with outlet obstruction and maximum urinary flow rate Qmax tends to decrease with obstruction we hypothesize that specific criteria consisting of a combination of high Piso and low Qmax may be able to differentiate obstructive from nonobstructive voiding dysfunction better than either parameter hundred five men with lower urinary tract symptoms underwent uroflowmetry and videourodynamics including cystometry continuous outlet occlusion test and micturitional urethral pressure profilometry Combined threshold values of Qmax of less than 12 and Piso of 100 cm H2O or greater were used to predict obstruction whereas threshold values of Qmax of at least 12 and Piso less than 100 cm H2O were used to predict the 205 patients 103 50 were significantly obstructed and 102 50 were only mildly obstructed or nonobstructed Of the total population 151 patients 74 were categorized by the combined flow and contractility criteria Of the categorized patients 141 93 were correctly diagnosed with regard to infravesical obstruction sensitivity 89 specificity 97 positive predictive value 97 and negative predictive value 91 combination of Qmax and Piso criteria can predict obstructive and nonobstructive voiding dysfunctions with high positive and negative predictive values in most patients with lower urinary tract symptoms Combining the results of uroflowmetry and isometric tests may help to guide treatment strategies that may improve the outcome of selected therapeutic options compared with strategies based on symptoms or uroflowmetry alone Furthermore this approach forms a basis for interpreting various noninvasive methods that have recently been introduced for the purpose of diagnosing bladder outlet obstruction View details for Web of Science ID A1996VR74800013 View details for

definite histological evidence of a regressed primary testicular men 21 to 36 years old presented with palpably normal testes and a presumed retroperitoneal extragonadal germ cell tumor After chemotherapy each patient underwent retroperitoneal lymph node dissection and ipsilateral orchiectomy The entire testis was submitted for histological evaluation and all calcifications were sonography revealed an echogenic focus or foci in all cases which corresponded to intratubular hematoxyphilic bodies in 2 In 3 cases the echogenic foci were intratubular psammoma bodies close to a fibrous scar with hemosiderin deposition 1 of which contained a focus of intratubular germ cell neoplasia The hematoxyphilic bodies appeared larger and more intensely echogenic on sonography than the psammoma bodies The remaining case had stromal calcifications near the rete hematoxyphilic bodies and fibrosis with hemosiderin deposits are believed to represent remnants of testicular carcinoma Our finding of intratubular germ cell neoplasia provides further proof that testicular carcinomas regress In 5 of 6 patients 83 with presumed extragonadal germ cell tumors we showed definite pathological evidence of a testicular carcinoma With a presumed retroperitoneal germ cell tumor and palpably normal testes sonographic demonstration of an echogenic lesion in the absence of a hypoechoic mass probably

CILIARY TUFTS IN THE EPIDIDYMIS A LESSON IN APPLIED ANATOMY UROLOGY Comiter BRUNING Morgentaler A 1995 46 5 Abstract We report a case of detached ciliary tufts DCTs discovered in the aspirate from an epididymal cyst in a man undergoing epididymal exploration for obstructive azoospermia The specimen was initially misdiagnosed as a parasite due to its appearance and spontaneous motion on fresh smear Since standard urology and histology texts identify ciliated cells only in the efferent duct of the male genital tract the source of DCTs in this patient was mysterious However on further review histologic studies have demonstrated that the first portion of the epididymis represents an extension of the efferent ducts and is lined with cilia The fact that the caput epididymis is composed of branched efferent ducts has significant implications for our understanding of congenital absence of the vas epididymal sperm aspiration spermatoceles and epididymal physiology View details for Web of
