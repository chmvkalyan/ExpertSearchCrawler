and a member of the Stanford Cancer Institute Stanford Neurosciences Institute and Dan received his in Chemistry from the University of Washington where he also minored in Physics as part of the Early Entrance Program He then moved to MIT to obtain a PhD in Biochemistry where his thesis work established the function of a DNA polymerase with roles in cancer and infectious disease and identified means through which its activity is regulated in normal biology and disease his graduation in 2007 Dan pursued postdoctoral training in genetics and cell biology as a Damon Runyon Cancer Research Foundation Fellow at the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research Here his work centered on the molecular chaperone Hsp90 the so called cancer chaperone and its relationship to the capacity of genetic variation to produce new phenotypes He also pioneered high throughput screening methods to investigate the physiological consequences of protein 2013 Jarosz joined the Stanford faculty where the goal of his and research program is to understand how some biological systems can remain unaltered for long periods whereas others that are genetically identical undergo rapid diversification This paradox lies at the heart of how neurons can be killed by improper expression of a single protein how cancer cells can tolerate accumulating mutation burden and how mutations have devastating consequences in some individuals but no effect in others The Jarosz lab employs multidisciplinary approaches ranging from chemical biology to quantitative genetics and uses models as diverse as baker

environments requires the acquisition of new heritable traits However mechanisms that safeguard the fidelity of DNA replication often limit the source of such novelty to relatively modest changes in the genetic code Thus the acquisition of new forms and functions is thought to be driven by rare variants that occur at random and are enriched during times of stress We have begun to study an intriguing alternative hypothesis that intrinsic links between protein folding and virtually every biological trait provide multiple avenues through which environmental stress can directly elicit heritable variation that drives evolution disease and aim is to identify and characterize these mechanisms at the molecular level integrating our findings to gain insight into the interplay among genetic variation phenotypic diversity and environmental fluctuations in complex cellular systems Much of our work centers on the specific influence of molecular chaperones proteins that help other proteins fold Other projects focus on the induction of epigenetic variation that can be passed from one generation to another via changes in protein conformation Our work employs multidisciplinary approaches including biochemistry analyses screening methodologies live cell imaging microfluidics and quantitative genetic techniques Ultimately we seek to not only to understand mechanisms that link environmental stress to the acquisition of biological novelty but also to identify means of manipulating them for therapeutic benefit and harnessing their power to engineer synthetic signaling

Jarosz 2020 Abstract Covalent modifications to histones are essential for development establishing distinct and functional chromatin domains from a common genetic sequence Whereas repressed chromatin is robustly inherited no mechanism that facilitates inheritance of an activated domain has been described Here we report that the Set3C histone deacetylase scaffold Snt1 can act as a prion that drives the emergence and transgenerational inheritance of an activated chromatin state This prion which we term for expressed information is triggered by transient Snt1 phosphorylation upon cell cycle arrest Once engaged the prion reshapes the activity of Snt1 and the Set3C complex recruiting RNA pol II and interfering with Rap1 binding to activate genes in otherwise repressed domains This transcriptional state confers broad resistance to environmental stress including antifungal drugs Altogether our results establish a robust means by which a prion can facilitate inheritance of an activated chromatin

Chakravarty Jakobson Jarosz 2019 Abstract Theory and experiments suggest that organisms would benefit from to future stressors based on reproducible environmental fluctuations experienced by their ancestors but the mechanisms driving remain enigmatic We report that the prion allows yeast to anticipate nutrient repletion after periods of starvation providing a strong selective advantage By transforming the landscape of gene expression regulates the decision between two broad growth and survival strategies mitotic proliferation or meiotic differentiation into a state is common in laboratory yeast strains where standard propagation practice produces regular cycles of nutrient scarcity followed by repletion Distinct variants are also widespread in wild yeast isolates from multiple niches establishing that prion polymorphs can be utilized in natural populations Our data provide a striking example of how epigenetic switches hidden in plain sight can establish a

in addition to folded domains We report that the disordered region of theevolutionarily ancient developmental regulator drives into condensates These proteinaceous particles are not composed of amyloid yet they are infectious allowing them to act as a epigenetic element a prion In contrast to many amyloid prions condensation of Vts1 enhances its function in mRNA decay and its properties are conserved over large evolutionary distances Yeast cells harboring downregulate a coherent network of mRNAs and exhibit improved growth under nutrient limitation Vts1 condensates formed from purified protein can transform naive cells to acquire Our data establish that of proteins can drive a form of epigenetics beyond the chromosome instilling adaptive gene expression programs that are heritable

Jarosz 2019 10 1 1222 Abstract Quantitative genetics aims to map genotype to phenotype often with the goal of understanding how organisms evolved However it remains unclear whether the genetic variants identified are exemplary of evolution Here we analyzed progeny of two wild Saccharomyces cerevisiae isolates to identify 195 loci underlying complex metabolic traits resolving 107 to single polymorphisms with diverse molecular mechanisms More than 20 of causal variants exhibited patterns of emergence inconsistent with neutrality Moreover contrary to expectation variation in diverse wild yeast isolates broadly exhibited this property over 30 of shared natural variants exhibited phylogenetic signatures suggesting that they are not neutral This pattern is likely attributable to both homoplasy and balancing selection on ancestral polymorphism Variants that emerged repeatedly were more likely to have done so in isolates from the same ecological niche Our results underscore the power of mapping of ecologically relevant traits in understanding adaptation and evolution View details for PubMedID 30874558 It not magic Hsp90 and its effects on genetic and epigenetic variation Seminars in cell developmental biology Zabinsky Mason Queitsch Jarosz 2018 Abstract Canalization or phenotypic robustness in the face of environmental and genetic perturbation is an emergent property of living systems Although this phenomenon has long been recognized its molecular underpinnings have remained enigmatic until recently Here we review the contributions of the molecular chaperone Hsp90 a protein that facilitates the folding of many key regulators of growth and development to canalization of phenotype and in times of stress drawing on studies in eukaryotes as diverse as baker yeast mouse ear cress and blind Mexican cavefish Hsp90 is a hub of hubs that interacts with many proteins that affect virtually every aspect of cell signaling and physiology As Hsp90 facilitates client folding and stability it can epistatically suppress or enable the expression of genetic variants in its clients and other proteins that acquire client status through mutation Hsp90 vast interaction network explains the breadth of its phenotypic reach including de novo mutations and epigenetic effects on gene regulation Intrinsic links between environmental stress and Hsp90 function thus endow living systems with phenotypic plasticity in fluctuating environments As environmental perturbations alter Hsp90 function they also alter Hsp90 interaction with its client proteins thereby networks that determine the map Ensuing of phenotype creates phenotypic diversity that is not simply stochastic but often has an underlying genetic basis Thus extreme phenotypes can be selected and assimilated so that they no longer require environmental stress to manifest In addition to acting on standing genetic variation Hsp90 perturbation has also been linked to increased frequency of de novo variation and several epigenetic phenomena all with the potential to generate heritable phenotypic change Here we aim to clarify and discuss the multiple means by which Hsp90 can affect phenotype and possibly evolutionary change and identify their underlying common feature at its core Hsp90 interacts epistatically through its chaperone function with many other genes and their gene products Its influence on phenotypic diversification is thus not magic but rather a fundamental property of genetics View details for PubMedID 29807130 It Pays To Be in Phase BIOCHEMISTRY Itakura Futia Jarosz 2018 57 17 Abstract To survive organisms must orchestrate competing biochemical and regulatory processes in time and space Recent work has suggested that the underlying chemical properties of some biomolecules allow them to and that life may have exploited this property to organize biochemistry in space and time Such phase separation is ubiquitous particularly among the many regulatory proteins that harbor intrinsically disordered domains And yet despite evident regulation by modification and myriad other stimuli the biological significance of many compartments remains uncertain Many potential functions have been proposed but far fewer have been demonstrated A burgeoning subfield at the intersection of cell biology and polymer physics has defined the biophysical underpinnings that govern the genesis and stability of these particles The picture is complex many assemblies are composed of multiple proteins that each have the capacity to phase separate Here we briefly discuss this foundational work and survey recent efforts combining targeted biochemical perturbations and quantitative modeling to specifically address the diverse roles that phase separation processes may play in biology View

Jarosz 2018 172 3 Abstract Understanding the sequence determinants that give rise to diversity among individuals and species is the central challenge of genetics However despite ever greater numbers of sequenced genomes most association studies can not distinguish causal variants from linked passenger mutations spanning many genes We report that this inherent challenge can be overcome in model organisms By pushing the advantages of inbred crossing to its practical limit in Saccharomyces cerevisiae we improved the statistical resolution of linkage analysis to single nucleotides This approach allowed us to map 370 causal variants across 26 quantitative traits Missense synonymous and mutations collectively gave rise to phenotypic diversity providing mechanistic insight into the basis of evolutionary divergence Our data also systematically unmasked complex genetic architectures revealing that multiple closely linked driver mutations frequently act on the same quantitative trait mapping thus complements traditional deletion and overexpression screening paradigms and opens new frontiers in quantitative genetics View details for PubMedID 29373829 View details for

sequence This phenomenon has largely been studied in the context of chromatin modification Yet many epigenetic traits are instead linked to changes in the individual or collective activity of proteins Most such proteins are prions URE3 and which have the capacity to adopt at least one conformation that over long biological timescales This allows them to serve as epigenetic elements that are readily broadcast through mitosis and meiosis In some circumstances can fuel disease but it also permits access to multiple activity states from the same polypeptide and transmission of that information across generations Ensuing phenotypic changes allow genetically identical cells to express diverse and frequently adaptive phenotypes Although long thought to be rare epigenetic inheritance has now been uncovered in all domains of life View details for PubMedID 29153393 View details for PubMedCentralID PMC5775936 Specification of Physiologic and Disease States by Distinct Proteins and Protein

highlight the diversity including differences in biophysical properties that drive distinct biological functions and pathologies among proteins Advances in chemical genomics gene editing and model systems now permit deconstruction of the complex interplay between these protein states and the host factors that react to them These methods reveal that conformational switches modulate normal and

Comprehensive and quantitative mapping of interactions across a transcribed eukaryotic genome PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA She Chakravarty Layton Chircus Andreasson Damaraju McMahon Buenrostro Jarosz Greenleaf J 2017 114 14 Abstract proteins RBPs control the fate of nearly every transcript in a cell However no existing approach for studying these posttranscriptional gene regulators combines throughput and biophysical precision Here we describe an assay that accomplishes this Using commonly available hardware we built a customizable platform that leverages the inherent throughput of Illumina technology for direct biophysical measurements We used the platform to quantitatively measure the binding affinity of the prototypical RBP Vts1 for every transcript in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome The scale and precision of these measurements revealed many previously unknown features of this RBP Our transcribed genome array TGA assayed both rare and abundant transcripts with equivalent proficiency revealing hundreds of targets missed by previous approaches These targets regulated diverse biological processes including nutrient sensing and the DNA damage response and implicated Vts1 in de novo gene birth TGA provided resolution for each binding site and delineated a highly specific sequence and structure motif for Vts1 binding Changes in transcript levels in vts1Δ cells established the regulatory function of these binding sites The impact of Vts1 on transcript abundance was largely independent of where it bound within an mRNA challenging prevailing assumptions about how this RBP drives RNA degradation TGA thus enables a quantitative description of the relationship between variant RNA structures affinity and in vivo phenotype on a scale We anticipate that TGA will provide similarly comprehensive and quantitative insights into the function of virtually any RBP View details for DOI View details for Web of

for fermentative glucose metabolism has motivated domestication of the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae This program can be circumvented by a genetic element the GAR prion permitting simultaneous metabolism of glucose and other carbon sources Diverse bacteria can elicit yeast cells to acquire GAR although the molecular details of this interaction remain unknown Here we identify the common bacterial metabolite lactic acid as a strong GAR inducer Transient exposure to lactic acid caused yeast cells to heritably circumvent glucose repression This trait had the defining genetic properties of GAR and did not require utilization of lactic acid as a carbon source Lactic acid also induced GAR epigenetic states in fungi that diverged from cerevisiae million years ago and in which glucose repression evolved independently To our knowledge this is the first study to uncover a bacterial metabolite with the capacity to potently induce a prion View details for DOI View details for

She Lee Fremin Lindquist Jarosz 2016 167 2 e12 Abstract Prions are a mechanism of inheritance in which phenotypes are encoded by protein conformations rather than nucleic acids Here we examine the breadth of inheritance across the yeast proteome by assessing the ability of nearly every open reading frame ORF ORFs to induce heritable traits Transient overexpression of nearly 50 proteins created traits that remained heritable long after their expression returned to normal These traits were beneficial had patterns of inheritance were common in wild yeasts and could be transmitted to naive cells with protein alone Most inducing proteins were not known prions and did not form amyloid Instead they are highly enriched in nucleic acid binding proteins with large intrinsically disordered domains that have been widely conserved across evolution Thus our data establish a common type of inheritance through which intrinsically disordered proteins can drive the emergence of new traits and

Jarosz 2016 129 Abstract Cancer cells have the unusual capacity to limit the cost of the mutation load that they harbor and simultaneously harness its evolutionary potential This property fuels drug resistance a key failure mode in therapy However the factors that regulate this capacity might also provide an Achilles heel that could be exploited therapeutically Recently insight has come from a seemingly distant field protein folding It is now clear that protein homeostasis broadly supports malignancy and fuels the rapid evolution of drug resistance Among protein homeostatic mechanisms that influence cancer biology the essential molecular chaperone protein 90 Hsp90 is especially important Hsp90 catalyzes folding of many proteins that regulate growth and development These client kinases transcription factors and ubiquitin ligases often play critical roles in human disease especially cancer Studies in a wide range of organisms to human tumor that Hsp90 can broadly reshape the map between genotype and phenotype acting as a capacitor and potentiator of genetic variation Indeed it has likely done so to such a degree that it has left an impress on diverse genome sequences Hsp90 can constitute as much as 5 of total protein in transformed cells and increased levels of activation correlate with poor prognosis in breast cancer These findings and others have motivated a flurry of interest in Hsp90 inhibitors as cancer therapeutics which have met with rather limited success as single agents but may eventually prove invaluable in limiting the emergence of resistance to other chemotherapeutics both genotoxic and molecularly targeted Here we provide an overview of Hsp90 function review its relationship to genetic variation and the evolution of new traits and discuss the

in isolation but in the wild they compete and cooperate in complex communities We report a system for communication by which bacteria heritably transform yeast metabolism An ancient biological circuit blocks yeast from using other carbon sources in the presence of glucose GAR a epigenetic element allows yeast to circumvent this glucose repression and use multiple carbon sources in the presence of glucose Some bacteria secrete a chemical factor that induces GAR GAR is advantageous to bacteria because yeast cells make less ethanol and is advantageous to yeast because their growth and viability is improved in complex carbon sources This communication is broadly conserved providing a compelling argument for its adaptive value By heritably transforming growth and survival strategies in response to the selective pressures of life in a biological community GAR presents a unique example of Lamarckian inheritance View details for DOI View details for PubMedID 25171409 An Evolutionarily Conserved Element Converts Wild Fungi from Metabolic Specialists to Generalists Cell Jarosz Lancaster Brown Lindquist 2014 158 5 Abstract GAR is a element of inheritance that allows yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to circumvent a hallmark of their biology extreme metabolic specialization for glucose fermentation When glucose is present yeast will not use other carbon sources GAR allows cells to circumvent this glucose repression GAR is induced in yeast by a factor secreted by bacteria inhabiting their environment We report that de novo rates of GAR appearance correlate with the yeast ecological niche Evolutionarily distant fungi possess similar epigenetic elements that are also induced by bacteria As expected for a mechanism whose adaptive value originates from the selective pressures of life in biological communities the ability of bacteria to induce GAR and the ability of yeast to respond to bacterial signals have been extinguished repeatedly during the extended monoculture of domestication Thus GAR is a broadly conserved adaptive strategy that links environmental and social cues to heritable changes in metabolism View details for DOI View details for

6164 Abstract In the process of morphological evolution the extent to which cryptic preexisting variation provides a substrate for natural selection has been controversial We provide evidence that heat shock protein 90 HSP90 phenotypically masks standing variation in surface populations of the cavefish Astyanax mexicanus This variation is exposed by HSP90 inhibition and can be selected for ultimately yielding a phenotype even in the presence of full HSP90 activity Raising surface fish under conditions found in caves taxes the HSP90 system unmasking the same phenotypic variation as does direct inhibition of HSP90 These results suggest that cryptic variation played a role in the evolution of eye loss in cavefish and provide the first evidence for HSP90 as a capacitor for morphological

a mechanism for generating heritable phenotypic diversity that promotes survival in fluctuating environments and the evolution of new traits However this hypothesis is highly controversial Prions that create new traits have not been found in wild strains leading to the perception that they are rare of laboratory cultivation Here we biochemically test approximately 700 wild strains of Saccharomyces for PSI or MOT3 and find these prions in many They conferred diverse phenotypes that were frequently beneficial under selective conditions Simple meiotic of the variation harboured within a strain readily fixed one such trait making it robust and Finally we genetically screened for unknown prion elements Fully of wild strains harboured them These too created diverse often beneficial phenotypes

the nature and adaptive value of traits remain uncertain In ecologically and genetically diverse yeasts we find such traits to be both common and frequently adaptive Most are based on preexisting variation with causative polymorphisms occurring in coding and regulatory sequences alike A common temperature stress alters phenotypes similarly Both selective inhibition of Hsp90 and temperature

Essigmann Walker 2006 439 7073 Abstract Translesion synthesis TLS by DNA polymerases is a chief mechanism of DNA damage tolerance Such TLS can be accurate or as it is for bypass of a cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer by DNA polymerase eta or Rad30 or bypass of a TT photoproduct by DNA polymerase V respectively Although DinB is the only DNA polymerase conserved among all domains of life the biological rationale for this striking conservation has remained enigmatic Here we report that the Escherichia coli dinB gene is required for resistance to some agents that form adducts at the of deoxyguanosine dG We show that DinB DNA polymerase IV catalyses accurate TLS over one such adduct and that DinB and its mammalian orthologue DNA polymerase kappa insert deoxycytidine dC opposite with greater catalytic proficiency than opposite undamaged dG We also show that mutating a single amino acid the gate residue of DinB Phe13 Val and that of its archaeal homologue Dbh Phe12 Ala separates the abilities of these enzymes to perform TLS over adducts from their abilities to replicate an undamaged template We propose that DinB and its orthologues are specialized to catalyse relatively accurate TLS over some adducts that are ubiquitous in nature that lesion bypass occurs more efficiently than synthesis on undamaged DNA and that this specificity may be achieved at least in part

Nature Genetic Toolkit Annual review of genetics Jakobson Jarosz 2020 Abstract The complexity of heredity has been appreciated for decades Many traits are controlled not by a single genetic locus but instead by polymorphisms throughout the genome The importance of complex traits in biology and medicine has motivated diverse approaches to understanding their detailed genetic bases Here we focus on recent systematic studies many in budding yeast which have revealed that large numbers of all kinds of molecular variation from noncoding to synonymous variants can make significant contributions to phenotype Variants can affect different traits in opposing directions and their contributions can be modified by both the environment and the epigenetic state of the cell The integration of prospective synthesizing and analyzing variants and retrospective examining standing variation approaches promises to reveal how natural selection shapes quantitative traits Only by comprehensively

Toinvestigate we charted 90 comprehensive maps in a large population of wild diploid yeast In contrast to assumptions all types of genetic variation contributed similarly to phenotype Causal synonymous and regulatory variants exhibited distinct molecular signatures as did nonlinearities in heterozygote fitness that likely contribute to hybrid vigor Highly pleiotropic variants altered disordered sequences within signaling hubs and their effects correlated across when that large fitness gains bring concomitant costs Naturalgenetic networks defined by the causal loci differed from

extreme epigenetic inheritance that can be stable through both mitotic and meiotic cell divisions Although the first prion discovered mammalian PrP is the causative agent of debilitating neuropathies many additional prions have now been identified that are not obviously detrimental and can even be adaptive Intrinsically disordered regions which endow proteins with the bulk property of can also be drivers of prion formation Indeed many protein domains that promote phase separation have been described as In this review we describe how prions lie at the crossroads of epigenetic inheritance and evolutionary adaptation View details for PubMedID 30031007 Organizing biochemistry in space and time using Current opinion in systems biology Jakobson Jarosz 2018 8 Abstract proteins have the capacity to adopt multiple stable conformations at least one of which can recruit proteins from the native conformation into the alternative fold Although classically associated with disease assembly has recently been proposed to organize a range of normal biochemical processes in space and time Organisms from bacteria to mammals use mechanisms to re organize their proteome in response to intracellular and extracellular stimuli behavior is an economical means to control biochemistry and gene regulation at the systems level and prions can act as genes to facilitate inheritance of induced traits These mechanisms allow individual cells to express distinct heritable traits using the same complement of polypeptides Understanding and controlling behavior is therefore a promising strategy to combat diverse pathologies and organize engineered biological systems View details for PubMedID 29725624 Screening for Inheritance in cerevisiae OF VISUALIZED EXPERIMENTS Byers Jarosz 2017 Abstract The encoding of biological information that is accessible to future generations is generally achieved via changes to the DNA sequence inheritance encoded in protein conformation rather than sequence has long been viewed as but rare The best characterized examples of such epigenetic elements are prions which possess a behavior that can drive the heritable manifestation of new phenotypes Many archetypal prions display a striking sequence bias and assemble into an amyloid fold These unusual features have informed most screening efforts to identify new prion proteins However at least three known prions including the founding prion PrPSc do not harbor these biochemical characteristics We therefore developed an alternative method to probe the scope of inheritance based on a property of mass action the transient overexpression of prion proteins increases the frequency at which they acquire a conformation This paper describes a method for analyzing the capacity of the yeast ORFeome to elicit inheritance Using this strategy we previously found that 1 of yeast proteins could fuel the emergence of biological traits that were stable and arose more frequently than genetic mutation This approach can be employed in high throughput across entire ORFeomes or as a targeted screening paradigm for specific genetic networks or environmental stimuli Just as forward genetic screens define numerous developmental and signaling pathways these techniques provide a methodology to investigate the influence of inheritance in biological processes View details for PubMedID 28809826 Old

polymers that have been found to cause fatal diseases in mammals Prions have also been identified in fungi yeast and filamentous fungi where they behave as cytoplasmic genetic elements Fungal prions correspond in most cases to fibrillary protein aggregates termed amyloids Fungal prion models and in particular yeast prions were instrumental in the description of fundamental aspects of prion structure and propagation These models established the nature of prions the physical basis of strain variation and the role of a variety of chaperones in prion propagation and amyloid aggregate

structurally and functionally distinct states at least one of which is The prion fold templates the conversion of native protein altering its structure and function and thus serves as a element of inheritance Molecular chaperones ensure that these prion aggregates are divided and faithfully passed from mother cells to their daughters Prions were originally identified as the cause of several rare neurodegenerative diseases in mammals but the last decade has brought great progress in understanding their broad importance in biology and evolution Most prion proteins regulate information flow in signaling networks or otherwise affect gene expression Consequently switching into and out of prion states creates diverse new traits heritable changes based on protein structure rather than nucleic acid Despite intense study of the molecular mechanisms of this epigenetic mode of inheritance many key questions remain Recent studies in yeast that support the view that prions are common often beneficial elements of inheritance that link environmental stress to the appearance of new traits View details for DOI View details for Web of Science ID 000330816300013 HSP90 at the hub of

DinB variant reveals diverse physiological consequences of incomplete TLS extension by a DNA polymerase PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA Jarosz Cohen Delaney Essigmann Walker 2009 106 50 Abstract The only DNA polymerase conserved among all domains of life DinB and its mammalian ortholog pol kappa catalyzes proficient bypass of damaged DNA in translesion synthesis TLS DNA polymerases including DinB have been implicated in diverse biological phenomena ranging from adaptive mutagenesis in bacteria to several human cancers Complete TLS requires dNTP insertion opposite a replication blocking lesion and subsequent extension with several dNTP additions Here we report remarkably proficient TLS extension by DinB from Escherichia coli We also describe a TLS DNA polymerase variant generated by mutation of an evolutionarily conserved tyrosine Y79 This mutant DinB protein is capable of catalyzing dNTP insertion opposite a lesion but can not complete TLS stalling three nucleotides after an N 2 adduct Strikingly expression of this variant transforms a bacteriostatic DNA damaging agent into a bactericidal drug resulting in profound toxicity even in a dinB background We find that this phenomenon is not exclusively due to a futile cycle of abortive TLS followed by exonucleolytic reversal Rather gene products with roles in cell death and metal homeostasis modulate the toxicity of DinB Y79L expression Together these results indicate that DinB is specialized to perform remarkably proficient insertion and extension on damaged DNA and also expose unexpected connections between TLS and cell fate View details for DOI View details for Web of Science ID 000272795300025 View details for PubMedID 19948952 Song SOS To the Tune of

potential of the Y family DNA polymerase DinB MOLECULAR CELL Godoy Jarosz Simon Abyzov Ilyin Walker 2007 28 6 Abstract DinB is the only translesion Y family DNA polymerase conserved among bacteria archaea and eukaryotes DinB and its orthologs possess a specialized lesion bypass function but also display potentially deleterious frameshift mutagenic phenotypes when overproduced We show that the DNA proteins UmuD 2 and RecA act in concert to modulate this mutagenic activity Structural modeling suggests that the relatively open active site of DinB is enclosed by interaction with these proteins thereby preventing the template bulging responsible for frameshift mutagenesis Intriguingly residues that define the UmuD 2 surface on DinB statistically covary throughout evolution suggesting a driving force for the maintenance of a regulatory interaction at this site Together these observations indicate that proteins like RecA and UmuD 2 may be responsible for managing the mutagenic potential of DinB orthologs throughout evolution View details for DOI View details for Web of Science ID 000252170000012 View details for PubMedID 18158902 DNA polymerase V allows bypass of toxic guanine oxidation products in vivo JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY Neeley Delaney Alekseyev Jarosz Delaney Walker Essigmann 2007 282 17 Abstract Reactive oxygen and nitrogen radicals produced during metabolic processes such as respiration and inflammation combine with DNA to form many lesions primarily at guanine sites Understanding the roles of the polymerases responsible for the processing of these products to mutations could illuminate molecular mechanisms that correlate oxidative stress with cancer Using M13 viral genomes engineered to contain single DNA lesions and Escherichia coli strains with specific polymerase pol knockouts we show that pol V is required for efficient bypass of structurally diverse highly mutagenic guanine oxidation products in vivo We also find that pol IV participates in the bypass of two spiroiminodihydantoin lesions Furthermore we report that one lesion is a substrate for multiple SOS polymerases whereby pol II is necessary for replication and pol V for replication past this lesion The results spotlight a major role for pol V and minor roles for pol II and pol IV in the mechanism of guanine oxidation mutagenesis View details for DOI View details

Abstract Despite nearly universal conservation through evolution the precise function of the kappa branch of the of DNA polymerases has remained unclear Recent results suggest that DinB orthologs from all domains of life proficiently bypass replication blocking lesions that may be recalcitrant to DNA repair mechanisms Like other translesion DNA polymerases the error frequency of DinB and its orthologs is higher than the DNA polymerases that replicate the majority of the genome However recent results suggest that some polymerases including DinB and pol kappa bypass certain types of DNA damage with greater proficiency than an undamaged template Moreover they do so relatively accurately The ability to employ this mechanism to manage DNA damage may be especially important for types of DNA modification that elude repair mechanisms For these lesions translesion synthesis may represent a more important line of defense than for other types of DNA damage that are more easily dealt with by other more accurate mechanisms View details for Web of Science ID 000245577800012 View details for PubMedID 17377496 DNA polymerases in Escherichia coli TRENDS IN MICROBIOLOGY Jarosz Beuning Cohen

is an active rather than passive process Genetic and biochemical studies have revealed that and its homolog encode novel DNA polymerases with the ability to catalyze synthesis past DNA lesions that otherwise stall replication a process termed translesion synthesis TLS Similar polymerases have been identified in nearly all organisms constituting a new enzyme superfamily Although typically viewed as unfaithful copiers of DNA recent studies suggest that certain TLS polymerases can perform proficient and moderately accurate bypass of particular types of DNA damage Moreover various cellular factors can modulate their activity and mutagenic potential View details for DOI View details for Web of Science ID 000244535900004 View details for PubMedID 17207624 DNA polymerases respond to DNA inhibition of replication fork progression EMBO JOURNAL Godoy Jarosz Walker Simmons Walker 2006 25 4 Abstract In Escherichia coli the DNA polymerases Pol IV DinB and Pol V UmuD2 C enhance cell survival upon DNA damage by bypassing DNA lesions We report a unique function for these polymerases when DNA replication fork progression is arrested not by exogenous DNA damage but with hydroxyurea HU thereby inhibiting ribonucleotide reductase and bringing about DNA replication stalling Remarkably the umuC122 allele of umuC dinB and certain forms of umuD gene products endow coli with the ability to withstand HU treatment HUR The catalytic activities of the UmuC122 and DinB proteins are both required for HUR Moreover the lethality brought about by such stalled replication forks in the derivatives appears to proceed through the pairs mazEF and relBE This novel function reveals a role for polymerases in enhancing cell survival under conditions of nucleotide starvation in addition to their established functions in response to DNA damage View details for DOI View details for Web of Science ID 000236225000020 View details for PubMedID 16482223 Characterization of Escherichia coli translesion synthesis polymerases and their accessory factors DNA REPAIR PT A Beuning Simon Godoy Jarosz Walker 2006 408 Abstract Members of the Y family of DNA polymerases are specialized to replicate DNA However they lack exonuclease activity and have reduced fidelity compared to replicative polymerases when copying undamaged templates and thus are potentially mutagenic Y family polymerases must be tightly regulated to prevent aberrant mutations on undamaged DNA while permitting replication only under conditions of DNA damage These polymerases provide a mechanism of DNA damage tolerance confer cellular resistance to a variety of agents and have been implicated in bacterial persistence The Y family polymerases are represented in all domains of life Escherichia coli possesses two members of the Y family DNA pol IV DinB and DNA pol V UmuD 2 C and several regulatory factors including those encoded by the umuD gene that influence the activity of UmuC This chapter outlines procedures for in vivo and in vitro analysis of these proteins Study of the coli Y family polymerases and their accessory factors is important for understanding the broad principles of DNA damage tolerance and mechanisms of mutagenesis throughout evolution Furthermore study of these enzymes and their role in mutagenesis may also give insight into a variety of phenomena including the growing problem of bacterial antibiotic resistance View details for DOI 06 View details for Web of Science ID 000238224100020 View details for PubMedID 16793378 Report Accessibility Issues Powered By
