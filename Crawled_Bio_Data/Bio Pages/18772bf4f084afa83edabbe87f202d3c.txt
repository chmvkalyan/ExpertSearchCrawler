differences in at the 2019 American Society of Hematology Annual Meeting Blood advances Moazzam Onstad Marshall Osunkwo Du Dunn Dunlap Reed Luger Lee J 2020 4 21 Abstract Attendance at professional conferences is an important component of career development because conferences are a major forum for presenting new research interacting with colleagues and networking An extensive literature documents differences in the professional experiences of women and men including experiences at professional conferences We hypothesized that women are less likely than men to ask questions at conferences thus forgoing opportunities for professional development To address this issue we analyzed the behavior of women and men at the 2019 Annual Meeting and Exposition of the American Society of Hematology In all 112 sessions 55 of those eligible were randomly chosen for coding yielding data on 577 presentations Although approximately 50 of moderators and speakers were women the proportion of questions asked by women was significantly lower compared with the estimated proportion of women attending the conference 23 vs 39 P Women were more likely to ask questions if another woman asked the first question or if the session topic was red cells These results suggest that although women are represented equally as moderators and speakers they are less likely to engage in the postpresentation discourse by asking questions Encouraging women to speak up in professional situations and providing training on skills can help address this gender gap that potentially contributes to disparities in professional visibility and career advancement for women in hematology View details for DOI View details for PubMedID 33166404 Genomic landscape of Neutrophilic Leukemias of Ambiguous Diagnosis Blood Zhang Wilmot Bottomly Dao Stevens Eide Khanna Rofelty Savage Long White Carlos Henson Lin Searles Collins DeAngelo Deininger Dunn Than Luskin Medeiros Oh Pollyea Steensma Stone Druker McWeeney Maxson Gotlib Tyner 2019 Abstract Chronic neutrophilic leukemia CNL atypical chronic myeloid leukemia aCML and neoplasms unclassifiable are a group of rare heterogeneous myeloid disorders There is strong morphologic resemblance amongst these distinct diagnostic entities as well as lack of specific molecular markers and limited understanding of disease pathogenesis which has made diagnosis challenging in certain cases The treatment has remained empirical resulting in dismal outcomes We therefore performed whole exome and of these rare hematologic malignancies and present the most complete survey of the genomic landscape of these diseases to date We observed a diversity of combinatorial mutational patterns that generally do not cluster within any one diagnosis Gene expression analysis reveals enrichment but not of clinical and genetic disease features with transcriptional clusters In conclusion these group of diseases represent a continuum of related diseases rather than discrete diagnostic entities View details for DOI View details for PubMedID 31366621 Effect of Fitbit and iPad Wearable Technology in Quality of Life in Adolescent and Young Adult Cancer Patients Journal of adolescent and young adult oncology Yurkiewicz Simon Liedtke Dahl Dunn 2018 Abstract PURPOSE Adolescent and young adult AYA patients with cancer face significant challenges with regard to fatigue reduced physical activity and social isolation which may negatively impact quality of life This study investigated whether the use of digital wearable technology Fitbits along with synced iPads can affect quality of life HRQOL in AYA aged patients with AND METHODS This was a prospective cohort study that offered Fitbits and iPads to all AYA patients aged 15 to 29 at an academic medical center at the time of cancer diagnosis Patients completed the Short Form Health Survey developed by RAND assessing eight dimensions of HRQOL on entering the study and at the time of their or the end of treatment whichever occurred first At the time of patients also completed a questionnaire that assessed user experience including frequency of wearable device use enjoyment challenges and participation in online patients participated in the study Most patients reported enjoying the digital technology and using the devices to track multiple aspects of their health 85 Most also reported a subjective increase in physical activity 79 After the intervention participants demonstrated significant improvements across all eight dimensions of HRQOL measured by the p to Distributing wearable technology at the time of diagnosis may provide an avenue for improving HRQOL in adolescents and young adults with cancer View details for PubMedID 29924668 Effect of Fitbit and iPad Wearable

International journal of hematology Dinner Dunn Price Coutré Gotlib Berube Kaufman Medeiros Liedtke 2018 Abstract This phase 1 study investigated the safety of the anthracycline amrubicin combined with lenalidomide and dexamethasone in adults with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma A standard 3 3 design was used Patients received intravenous amrubicin on day one lenalidomide 15 mg orally on days and dexamethasone 40 mg orally weekly on 21 day cycles 14 patients were enrolled and completed a median of three cycles The maximum tolerated dose was not reached One patient experienced dose limiting toxicity of dizziness and diarrhea The most frequent toxicity was infection 79 Serious adverse events included cord compression and sepsis Three patients 21 had a partial response or better and seven 50 had stable disease The median duration of response was months and the median survival was 3 months Amrubicin combined with lenalidomide and dexamethasone was safe and demonstrated clinical activity in relapsed or refractory multiple identifier NCT01355705 View details for PubMedID 29802551 Prognostic impact of incomplete hematologic count recovery and minimal residual disease on outcome in adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia at the time of second complete response LEUKEMIA LYMPHOMA Saygin Papadantonakis Cassaday Liedtke Fischer Dunn Patel Sobecks Kalaycio Sekeres Mukherjee Gerds Hamilton Carraway Advani 2018 59 2 Abstract Outcomes of relapsed adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia ALL have improved over time with the introduction of new therapies as well as better supportive care However there is still a need for and accurate prognostic tools for patients in first relapse Whether complete response CR with incomplete count recovery CRh can be grouped with CR in relapsed ALL trials has not been formally studied We analyzed 106 ALL patients at first relapse who were treated at three academic centers and achieved White blood cell count at initial diagnosis and receiving hematopoietic cell transplant HCT were independent predictors of overall survival after relapse while minimal residual disease MRD positivity and performance of HCT were predictors of relapse free survival RFS Patients who achieved MRD negativity and underwent HCT had the best outcomes Our results suggest that MRD is a more powerful predictor of outcome than CRh View details for

2012 17 6 Abstract Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis HLH is a rare inflammatory disorder characterized by uncontrolled proliferation and activation of histiocytes with phagocytosis of normal hematopoietic cells A woman 19 weeks pregnant with twins and a history of Still disease presented with rash fever and headache Laboratory studies revealed transaminitis hyperbilirubinemia and eventually severe neutropenia as well as elevations in ferritin lactate dehydrogenase and protein A bone marrow biopsy confirmed HLH She declined standard but responded well to corticosteroids Her blood counts remained stable following corticosteroid taper and she delivered healthy twin girls at gestation Few cases of HLH during pregnancy have been reported In some cases the condition has proved fatal Therefore recognizing signs and symptoms of HLH is essential to avoid treatment delay In our case corticosteroids alone were a safe and effective therapy for the mother and fetuses
