Nucleic acids research Turakhia Chen Marcovitz Bejerano 2020 Abstract Gene losses provide an insightful route for studying the morphological and physiological adaptations of species but their discovery is challenging Existing genome annotation tools focus on annotating intact genes and do not attempt to distinguish nonfunctional genes from genes missing annotation due to sequencing and assembly artifacts Previous attempts to annotate gene losses have required significant manual curation which hampers their scalability for the deluge of newly sequenced genomes Using extreme sequence erosion amino acid deletions and substitutions and sister species support as an unambiguous signature of loss we developed an automated approach for detecting gene loss events across a species tree Our approach relies solely on gene annotation in a single reference genome raw assemblies for the remaining species to analyze and the associated phylogenetic tree for all organisms involved Using human as reference we discovered over 400 unique human ortholog erosion events across 58 mammals This includes dozens of losses of genes that result in early mouse lethality or are associated with severe human congenital diseases Our discoveries yield intriguing potential for translational medical genetics and evolutionary biology and our approach is readily applicable to genome sequencing

Bejerano 2020 12 544 Abstract The diagnosis of Mendelian disorders requires literature research Trained clinicians can spend hours looking for the right publication s supporting a single gene that best explains a patient disease AMELIE Automatic Mendelian Literature Evaluation greatly accelerates this process AMELIE parses all 29 million PubMed abstracts and downloads and further parses hundreds of thousands of articles in search of information supporting the causality and associated phenotypes of most published genetic variants AMELIE then prioritizes patient candidate variants for their likelihood of explaining any patient given set of phenotypes Diagnosis of singleton patients without relatives exomes is the most scenario and AMELIE ranked the causative gene at the very top for 66 of 215 diagnosed singleton Mendelian patients from the Deciphering Developmental Disorders project Evaluating only the top 11 genes of 127 median candidate genes per patient resulted in a rapid diagnosis in more than 90 of cases evaluation of all cases was 3 to 19 times more efficient than approaches We replicated these results on a retrospective cohort of clinical cases from Stanford

States of America Heavner Ji Notwell Dyer Tseng Birgmeier Yoo Bejerano McConnell 2020 Abstract We are only just beginning to catalog the vast diversity of cell types in the cerebral cortex Such categorization is a first step toward understanding how diversification relates to function All cortical projection neurons arise from a uniform pool of progenitor cells that lines the ventricles of the forebrain It is still unclear how these progenitor cells generate the more than 50 unique types of mature cortical projection neurons defined by their distinct profiles Moreover exactly how and when neurons diversify their function during development is unknown Here we relate gene expression and chromatin accessibility of two subclasses of projection neurons with divergent morphological and functional features as they develop in the mouse brain between embryonic day 13 and postnatal day 5 in order to identify transcriptional networks that diversify neuron cell fate We compare these profiles with published profiles of single cells isolated from similar populations and establish that cell classes encompass cell subtypes and developmental trajectories identified using sequencing Given the depth of our sequencing we identify groups of transcription factors with particularly dense regulation and transcription factor binding motifs We also describe transcription long noncoding RNAs that define each subclass and validate the function of Myt1l in balancing the ratio of the two subclasses in vitro Our multidimensional approach supports an evolving model of progressive restriction of cell fate competence through inherited transcriptional identities View details for DOI View details for PubMedID 32948690 Morphogenesis is transcriptionally coupled to neurogenesis during peripheral olfactory organ development Development Cambridge England Aguillon Madelaine Aguirrebengoa Guturu Link Dufourcq Lecaudey Bejerano Blader Batut J 2020 Abstract Sense organs acquire their distinctive shapes concomitantly with the differentiation of sensory cells and neurons necessary for their function While our understanding of the mechanisms controlling morphogenesis and neurogenesis in these structures has grown how these processes are coordinated remains largely unexplored Neurogenesis in the zebrafish olfactory epithelium requires the bHLH proneural transcription factor Neurogenin1 Neurog1 To address whether Neurog1 also controls morphogenesis we analysed the migratory behaviour of early olfactory neural progenitors in neurog1 mutant embryos Our results indicate that the oriented movements of these progenitors are disrupted in this context Morphogenesis is similarly affected by mutations in the chemokine receptor gene cxcr4b suggesting it is a potential Neurog1 target gene We find that Neurog1 directly regulates cxcr4b through an cluster located just upstream of the cxcr4b transcription start site Our results suggest that proneural transcription factors such as Neurog1 directly couple distinct aspects of nervous system development View details for DOI View details for PubMedID 33144399 A functional enrichment test for molecular convergent evolution finds a clear signal in echolocating bats and whales Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America Marcovitz Turakhia Chen Gloudemans Braun B Wang Bejerano 2019 Abstract Distantly related species entering similar biological niches often adapt by evolving similar morphological and physiological characters How much genomic molecular convergence particularly of highly constrained coding sequence contributes to convergent phenotypic evolution such as echolocation in bats and whales is a fundamental question Like others we find that convergent amino acid substitutions are not more abundant in echolocating mammals compared to their outgroups However we also ask a more informative question about the genomic distribution of convergent substitutions by devising a test to determine which if any of more than gene sets is most statistically enriched with convergent substitutions We find that the gene set most overrepresented with convergent substitutions in echolocators affecting 18 genes regulates development of the cochlear ganglion a structure with empirically supported relevance to echolocation Conversely when comparing to nonecholocating outgroups no significant gene set enrichment exists For aquatic and mammals our analysis highlights 15 and 16 genes from the gene sets most affected by molecular convergence which regulate skin and lung physiology respectively Importantly our test requires that the most set can not also be enriched for divergent substitutions such as in the pattern produced by inactivated vision genes in subterranean mammals Showing a clear role for adaptive molecular convergence we discover nearly convergent positions highlight 77 of them in 3 organs and provide code to

Exome analysis of patients with a likely monogenic disease does not identify a causal variant in over half of cases mutations make up the second largest class of known mutations Each individual singleton exome harbors over 500 rare variants of unknown significance VUS in the splicing region The existing relevant pathogenicity prediction tools tackle all variants as one amorphic class are not calibrated for the high sensitivity required for clinical use Here we calibrate seven such tools and devise a novel tool called Splicing Clinically Applicable Pathogenicity prediction that is over twice as powerful as all previous tools removing 41 of patient VUS at 95 sensitivity We show that does this by using its own features and not via over previous tools and that splicing pathogenicity

different mammals Nucleic acids research Berger Wenger Guturu Bejerano 2018 Abstract Genetic variation in elements is thought to be a major driving force in morphological and physiological changes However identifying transcription factor binding events that code for complex traits remains a challenge motivating novel means of detecting putatively important binding events Using a curated set of 1154 transcription factor motifs we demonstrate that independently eroded binding sites are enriched for independently lost traits in three distinct pairs of placental mammals We show that these independently eroded events pinpoint the loss of hindlimbs in dolphin and manatee degradation of vision in naked and mole and the loss of external testes in white rhinoceros and Weddell seal We additionally show that our method may also be utilized with more than two species Our study exhibits a novel methodology to detect mutations which help explain a portion of the molecular mechanism

prioritization Genetics in medicine official journal of the American College of Medical Genetics Jagadeesh Birgmeier Guturu Deisseroth Wenger Bernstein J Bejerano 2018 Abstract PURPOSE Exome sequencing and diagnosis is beginning to spread across the medical establishment The most part of diagnosis is the manual step of matching the potentially long list of patient candidate genes to patient phenotypes to identify the causative We introduce Phrank for phenotype ranking an information method that utilizes a Bayesian network to prioritize candidate diseases or genes as a module that can be run with any underlying knowledgebase and any variant filtering Phrank outperforms existing methods at ranking the causative disease or gene when applied to 169 real patient exomes with Mendelian diagnoses Phrank greatest improvement is in disease space where across all 169 patients it ranks only 3 diseases on average ahead of the true diagnosis whereas Phenomizer ranks 32 diseases ahead of the causal Using Phrank to rank all patient candidate genes or diseases as they start working through a new case will save the busy clinician much time in deriving a genetic diagnosis View

the original association studies Consistent with these results depletion affects retinal vasculature formation demonstrating as a critical gene underpinning the associated trait Importantly we validated that other CNEs act as transcriptional enhancers that can be disrupted by conserved SNPs This study uncovers mutations that are deeply conserved providing a path for in vivo testing to

known to demonstrate both autosomal dominant and autosomal recessive inheritance Typical manifestations include short stature characteristic facies and skeletal anomalies Recessive inheritance has been associated with mutations in ROR2 while dominant inheritance has been observed for mutations in WNT5A DVL1 and DVL3 Through trio whole genome sequencing we identified a homozygous frameshifting

malformations including congenital diaphragmatic hernia ambiguous genitalia dysmorphic facies shortened long bones adactyly and ventricular septal defect The parents who are both heterozygous for the

Bejerano Lehman Alfei Pantaleoni Conti Guerrini Moog Graham Hevner Dobyns Mirzaa 2017 140 10 Abstract Mutations of genes within the PI3K pathway are well known causes of brain overgrowth megalencephaly as well as segmental cortical dysplasia such as hemimegalencephaly focal cortical dysplasia and polymicrogyria Mutations of the AKT3 gene have been reported in a few individuals with brain malformations to date Therefore our understanding regarding the clinical and molecular spectrum associated with mutations of this critical gene is limited with no clear correlations We sought to further delineate this spectrum study levels of mosaicism and identify correlations of disorders We performed targeted sequencing of AKT3 on individuals with these phenotypes by molecular inversion probes Sanger sequencing to determine the type and level of mosaicism of mutations We analysed all clinical and brain imaging data of individuals including neuropathological analysis in one instance We performed ex vivo kinase assays on AKT3 engineered with the patient mutations and examined the phospholipid binding profile of pleckstrin homology domain localizing mutations We identified 14 new individuals with AKT3 mutations with several phenotypes dependent on the type of mutation and level of mosaicism Our comprehensive clinical characterization and review of all previously published patients broadly segregates individuals with AKT3 mutations into two groups patients with highly asymmetric cortical dysplasia caused by the common mutation and patients with constitutional AKT3 mutations exhibiting more variable phenotypes including bilateral cortical malformations polymicrogyria periventricular nodular heterotopia and diffuse megalencephaly without cortical dysplasia All mutations increased kinase activity and pleckstrin homology domain mutants exhibited enhanced phospholipid binding Overall our study shows that activating mutations of the critical AKT3 gene are associated with a wide spectrum of brain involvement ranging from focal or segmental brain malformations such as hemimegalencephaly and polymicrogyria predominantly due to mosaic AKT3 mutations to diffuse bilateral cortical malformations megalencephaly and heterotopia due to constitutional AKT3 mutations We also provide the first detailed neuropathological examination of a child with extreme megalencephaly due to a constitutional AKT3 mutation This child has one of the largest documented paediatric brain sizes to our knowledge Finally our data show that constitutional AKT3 mutations are associated with megalencephaly with or without autism similar to disorders Recognition of this broad clinical and molecular spectrum of AKT3 mutations is important for providing early diagnosis and appropriate management of affected individuals and will facilitate targeted design of future human clinical trials using pathway inhibitors View details for PubMedID 28969385 Couples Brain

and blood vessels grow in close apposition but many of the molecular pathways regulating neuronal and neurovascular system development remain to be deciphered Here we show that links neurogenesis and angiogenesis through the formation of neurons expressing We found that directly targets the transcription factors TLX and ONECUTs to regulate expression inhibition leads to increased TLX and ONECUT expression resulting in overexpression This untimely increase of neuronal signal leads to the thickening of blood vessels at the expense of the normal formation of the neurovascular network in the brain and retina Thus this conserved transcriptional cascade is critical for proper brain development in vertebrates Because of this dual role on neural stem cell proliferation and angiogenesis and

studies have identified multiple genes harboring de novo LoF variants in individuals with autism spectrum disorders ASD including TBR1 a master regulator of cortical development We performed for TBR1 during mouse cortical neurogenesis and show that regions are enriched adjacent to ASD genes ASD genes were also enriched among genes that are differentially expressed in Tbr1 knockouts which together with the data suggests direct transcriptional regulation Of the nine ASD genes examined seven were misexpressed in the cortices of Tbr1 knockout mice including six with increased expression in the deep cortical layers ASD genes with adjacent cortical TBR1 peaks also showed unusually low levels of LoF mutations in a reference human population and among Icelanders We then leveraged TBR1 binding to identify an appealing subset of candidate ASD genes Our findings highlight a network of ASD genes in the developing neocortex that are relatively intolerant to LoF mutations indicating that these

function as elements controlling gene expression levels in different biological contexts However determining specific associations between CNEs and related phenotypes is a challenging task Here we present a computational reverse genomics approach that predicts the phenotypic functions of human CNEs We identify thousands of human CNEs that were lost in at least two independent mammalian lineages

raising the question of the existence of alternate processes to identify disease mutations To address this question we collect ancestral transcription factor binding sites disrupted by an individual variants and then look for their most significant congregation next to a group of functionally related genes Strikingly when the method is applied to five different full human genomes the top enriched

disease decreased circulating sodium level for an individual with hypertension and other biologically appealing links for medical histories spanning narcolepsy to axonal neuropathy Our results suggest that erosion of gene regulation by mutation load significantly contributes to observed heritable phenotypes that manifest in the medical history The test we developed exposes a hitherto hidden layer

Trophoblast invasion establishes adequate blood flow between mother and fetus in early placental development However little is known about the mechanisms underlying this important process We aimed to identify enhancer elements that are active during trophoblast invasion and build a trophoblast invasion carried out for an mark H3k27Ac at two time points during early placental development in mouse One time point when invasion is at its peak and another time point shortly afterwards We use computational analysis to identify putative enhancers as well as the transcription factor binding sites

code consisting of three transcription factor motifs AP1 Ets and Tcfap2 To validate differential expression of the transcription factors that bind these motifs we performed in the same context Finally we integrated these data with publicly available interaction data and constructed a trophoblast invasion data we generated and analysis we carried out improves our understanding of the regulatory

artery smooth muscle cells HCASMC Analysis of identified TCF21 target genes for enrichment of molecular and cellular annotation terms identified processes relevant to CAD pathophysiology including growth factor binding matrix interaction and smooth muscle contraction We characterized the canonical binding sequence for TCF21 as CAGCTG identified binding sites in TCF21 peaks and by conducting for JUN and JUND in HCASMC confirmed that there is significant overlap between TCF21 and binding loci in this cell type Expression quantitative trait variation mapped to target genes of TCF21 was significantly enriched among variants with low in the GWAS analyses suggesting a possible functional interaction between TCF21 binding and causal variants in other CAD disease loci Separate enrichment analyses found of TCF21 target genes among CAD associated genes and linkage disequilibrium between TCF21 peak variation and that found in GWAS loci consistent with the hypothesis that TCF21 may affect disease risk through interaction with other disease associated loci Interestingly enrichment for TCF21 target genes was also found among other genome wide association phenotypes including height and

evolution and the gene regulatory codes that pattern it we studied the overlap of its active developmental enhancers with transposable element TE families and compared this overlap to uniformly shuffled enhancers Here we show a striking enrichment of the MER130 repeat family among active enhancers in the mouse dorsal cerebral wall which gives rise to the neocortex at embryonic day We show that MER130 instances preserve a common code of transcriptional regulatory logic function as enhancers and are adjacent to critical neocortical genes MER130 a nonautonomous interspersed TE originates in the tetrapod or possibly Sarcopterygii ancestor which far predates the appearance of the neocortex Our results show that MER130 elements were recruited likely through their common regulatory logic

Genome research Camp Frank Lickwar Guturu Rube Wenger Chen Bejerano Crawford Rawls 2014 24 9 Abstract Microbiota regulate intestinal physiology by modifying host gene expression along the length of the intestine but the underlying regulatory mechanisms remain unresolved Transcriptional specificity occurs through interactions between transcription factors TFs and regions CRRs characterized by accessible chromatin We profiled transcriptome and accessible chromatin landscapes in intestinal epithelial cells IECs from mice reared in the presence or absence of microbiota We show that regional differences in gene transcription along the intestinal tract were accompanied by major alterations in chromatin accessibility Surprisingly we discovered that microbiota modify host gene transcription in IECs without significantly impacting the accessible chromatin landscape Instead microbiota regulation of host gene transcription might be achieved by differential expression of specific TFs and enrichment of their binding sites in CRRs near target genes Our results suggest that the chromatin landscape in IECs is preprogrammed by the host in a manner to permit responses to microbiota through

seldom tackled by methods and generate and analyse models of the predicted complexes bound to DNA Using this approach we predicted 422 physically realistic TF complex motifs at 18 false discovery rate the majority of which 326 77 contain some sequence overlap between binding sites The set of mostly novel complexes is enriched in known composite motifs predictive of binding site configurations in crystal structures and supported by datasets Structural modelling revealed three cooperativity mechanisms direct interactions potentially indirect interactions and interactions Indeed 38 of the predicted complexes were found to contain four or more bases in which TF pairs appear to synergize through overlapping binding to the same DNA base pairs in opposite grooves or strands Our TF complex

lost in mammals NUCLEIC ACIDS RESEARCH Hiller Schaar Bejerano 2012 40 22 Abstract Conserved DNA elements CNEs often encode elements and are rarely lost during evolution However CNE losses that do occur can be associated with phenotypic changes exemplified by pelvic spine loss in sticklebacks Using a computational strategy to detect complete loss of CNEs in mammalian genomes while strictly controlling for artifacts we find 600 CNEs that are independently lost in at least two mammalian lineages including a spinal cord enhancer near GDF11 We observed several genomic regions where multiple independent CNE loss events happened the most extreme is the DIAPH2 locus We show that CNE losses often involve deletions and that CNE loss frequencies are Similar to less pleiotropic enhancers we find that independently lost CNEs are shorter slightly less constrained and evolutionarily younger than CNEs without detected losses This suggests that independently lost CNEs are less pleiotropic and that pleiotropic constraints contribute to CNE loss frequencies We also detected 35 CNEs that are independently lost in the human lineage and in other mammals Our study uncovers an interesting aspect of the evolution of functional DNA in mammalian genomes Experiments are necessary to test if these independently lost CNEs are associated with parallel phenotype changes in mammals View details for

principles Homologies bridging the great divide between deuterostomes and protostomes have served as the basis for current models of animal evolution and development It is now appreciated that these two clades share a common developmental toolkit consisting of conserved transcription factors and signaling pathways These patterning genes sometimes show common expression patterns and genetic interactions suggesting the existence of similar or even conserved regulatory apparatus However previous studies have found no regulatory sequence conserved between deuterostomes and protostomes Here we describe the first such enhancers which we call bilaterian conserved regulatory elements Bicores Bicores show conservation of sequence and gene synteny Sequence conservation of Bicores reflects conserved patterns of transcription factor binding sites We predict that Bicores act as response elements to signaling pathways and we show that Bicores are developmental enhancers that drive expression of transcriptional repressors in the vertebrate central nervous system Although the small number of identified Bicores suggests extensive rewiring of between the protostome and deuterostome

that overlap with first exons By using mouse and zebrafish enhancer assays we demonstrate that several of these exonic enhancer eExons candidates can function as enhancers of their neighboring genes and that the exonic sequence is necessary for enhancer activity Using ChIP 3C and DNA FISH we further show that one of these exonic limb enhancers Dync1i1 exon 15 has active enhancer marks and

insertions that are evolving under purifying selection in mammals We show evidence that 1 of the 18 elements regulates the expression of ASXL3 during development by encoding an alternatively spliced exon that causes decay of the transcript The retroposon that gave rise to these functional elements was quickly inactivated in the mammalian ancestor and all traces of it have been lost due to neutral decay However the tuatara has maintained a version of this retroposon in its extant genome which allows us to connect the 18 human elements to the evolutionary events that created them We propose that conservation efforts over more than 100 years may not have only prevented the tuatara from going extinct but could have preserved our ability to understand the evolutionary history of functional elements in the human genome Through simulations we argue that species with historically low population sizes are more likely to harbor ancient mobile elements for long periods of time and in states

genomes that appear to be essential for vertebrate and amniote ontogeny Here we used similar methods to identify ultraconserved genomic regions between the insect species Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila pseudoobscura as well as the more distantly related Anopheles gambiae As with vertebrates ultraconserved sequences in insects appear to occur primarily in intergenic and intronic sequences and at junctions The sequences are significantly associated with genes encoding developmental regulators and transcription factors but are less frequent and are smaller in size than in vertebrates The longest identical nongapped orthologous match between the three genomes was found within the homothorax hth gene This sequence spans an internal junction with the majority located within the intron and is predicted to form a highly stable RNA structure quantitative PCR analysis of different hth splice isoforms and Northern blotting showed that the conserved element is associated with a high

for functional annotation and correct classification of newly discovered proteins Conventional Multiple Sequence Alignment MSA based methods find difficulties when faced with heterogeneous groups of

to poor or even false classification results An automated method that can analyze a group of proteins into the sequence domains it contains is therefore highly apply a novel method to the problem of protein domain detection The method takes as input an unaligned group of protein sequences It segments them and clusters the segments into groups sharing the same underlying statistics A Variable Memory Markov VMM model is built using a Prediction Suffix Tree PST data structure for each group of segments Refinement is achieved by letting the PSTs compete over the segments and a deterministic annealing framework infers the number of underlying PST models while avoiding many inferior solutions We show that regions of similar statistics correlate well with protein sequence domains by matching a unique signature to each domain This is done in a fully automated manner and does not require or attempt an MSA Several representative cases are analyzed We identify a protein fusion event

computational strategy employing transcription signals and genomic features of the known small genes The search for which we used rather restrictive criteria has led to the prediction of 24 putative genes of which 23 were tested experimentally Here we report on the discovery of 14 genes encoding novel small RNAs in coli and their expression patterns under a variety of physiological conditions Most of the newly discovered RNAs are abundant Interestingly the expression level of a significant number of these RNAs increases upon entry into stationary on our results we conclude that small RNAs are much more widespread than previously imagined and that these versatile molecules may play important roles in the of cell responses to changing environments View details for Web of Science ID

present a method for modeling protein families by means of probabilistic suffix trees PSTs The method is based on identifying significant patterns in a set of related protein sequences The patterns can be of arbitrary length and the input sequences do not need to be aligned nor is delineation of domain boundaries required The method is automatic and can be applied without assuming any preliminary biological information with surprising success Basic biological considerations such as amino acid background probabilities and amino acids substitution probabilities can be incorporated to improve PST can serve as a predictive tool for protein sequence classification and for detecting conserved patterns possibly functionally or structurally important within protein sequences The method was tested on the Pfam database of protein families with more than satisfactory performance Exhaustive evaluations show that the PST model detects much more related sequences than pairwise methods such as and is almost as sensitive as a hidden Markov model that is trained from a multiple alignment of the input sequences while being much faster View details for Web of Science ID 000167241500005
