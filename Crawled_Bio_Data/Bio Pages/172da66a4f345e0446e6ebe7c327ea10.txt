Links Curriculum Vitae PDF Bergmann Lab Current Research and Scholarly Interests Generating the full complement of functional cell types requires coordinating the production of cells with the specification programs that distinguish one cell type from another Asymmetric cell division in which one cell divides to create daughter cells that differ in size location cellular components or fate is extensively used in the development of animals In development of the epidermis in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana the specification and distribution of stomatal guard cells also requires oriented cell divisions By studying stomatal development one can explore how cells choose to initiate asymmetric divisions how cells establish an internal polarity that can be translated into an asymmetric cell division and how cells interpret external cues to align their divisions relative to the polarity of the whole tissue Moreover approaching these questions in a plant system is likely to reveal new solutions to the problem of balancing the robust specification of cell types with the ability to change development in the face of injury or environmental change Courses Independent Studies

Muroyama Gong Bergmann 2020 Abstract Multicellular development depends on generating and precisely positioning distinct cell types within tissues During leaf development pores in the epidermis called stomata are spaced at least one cell apart for optimal gas exchange This pattern is primarily driven by iterative asymmetric cell divisions ACDs in stomatal progenitors which generate most of the cells in the tissue A plasma polarity crescent defined by BREAKING OF ASYMMETRY IN THE STOMATAL LINEAGE BASL and BREVIS RADIX family BRXf proteins is required for asymmetric divisions and proper stomatal pattern but the cellular mechanisms that orient ACDs remain unclear Here utilizing quantitative microscopy we identified two oppositely oriented nuclear migrations that precede and succeed ACD during epidermal patterning The and migrations are dependent on microtubules and actin respectively and the polarity crescent is the unifying landmark that is both necessary and sufficient to orient both nuclear migrations We identified a specific and essential role for in controlling nuclear migration Loss of decreases stomatal density owing to an inability to accurately orient a specific subset of ACDs Taken together our analyses revealed successive and nuclear migrations that regulate ACD orientation in the Arabidopsis stomatal lineage View details for DOI View details for PubMedID

Bergmann 2020 Abstract When plants emerged from their aquatic origins to colonize land they needed to avoid desiccation while still enabling gas and water exchange with the environment The solution was the development of a waxy cuticle interrupted by epidermal pores known as stomata Despite the importance of stomata in plant physiology and their contribution to global water and carbon cycles our knowledge of the genetic basis of stomatal development is limited mostly to the model dicot Arabidopsis thaliana This limitation is particularly troublesome when evaluating grasses whose members represent our most crops Grass stomatal development follows a trajectory strikingly different from Arabidopsis and their uniquely shaped stomatal complexes are especially responsive to environmental inputs Thus understanding the development and regulation of these efficient complexes is of particular interest for the purposes of crop engineering This review focuses on genetic regulation of grass

thus play a crucial role in cell renewal regeneration and organization A number of stem cell genes have a known role in stem cell maintenance identity division Yet how genes expressed across different stem cell types referred to here as genes contribute to stem cell regulation is less understood Here we find that in the Arabidopsis root a gene CXC2 TCX2 controls stem cell division by regulating stem specific networks Development of a mathematical model of TCX2 expression allows us to show that TCX2 orchestrates the coordinated division of different stem cell types Our results highlight that genes expressed across different stem cell types ensure among cells allowing them to divide and develop harmonically together View details for DOI View details for PubMedID 31811116 Plant Cell Polarity Creating Diversity from Inside the Box Annual review of cell and developmental biology Muroyama Bergmann 2019 35 Abstract Cell polarity in plants operates across a broad range of spatial and temporal scales to control processes from acute cell growth to systemic hormone distribution Similar to other eukaryotes plants generate polarity at both the subcellular and tissue levels often through polarization of protein complexes However likely due to the constraints imposed by the cell wall and their extremely plastic development plants possess novel polarity molecules and mechanisms highly tuned to environmental inputs Considerable progress has been made in identifying key plant polarity regulators but detailed molecular understanding of polarity mechanisms remains incomplete in plants Here we emphasize the striking similarities in the conceptual frameworks that generate polarity in both animals and plants To this end we highlight how novel proteins engage in common themes of positive feedback dynamic intracellular trafficking and posttranslational regulation to establish polarity axes in development We end with a discussion of how environmental signals control intrinsic polarity to impact postembryonic organogenesis and growth View details for DOI View details for PubMedID 31590583 transcriptome and histone modification dynamics during cellular reprogramming in the Arabidopsis stomatal lineage Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America Lee Wengier Bergmann 2019 Abstract Plant cells maintain remarkable developmental plasticity allowing them to clonally reproduce and to repair tissues following wounding yet plant cells normally stably maintain consistent identities Although this capacity was recognized long ago our mechanistic understanding of the establishment maintenance and erasure of cellular identities in plants remains limited Here we develop a reprogramming system that can be probed at the scale for alterations in gene expression and histone modifications We show that relationships among H3K27me3 H3K4me3 and gene expression in single cell types mirror trends from complex tissue and that H3K27me3 dynamics regulate guard cell identity Further upon initiation of reprogramming guard cells induce repression of a regulator of callus formation suggesting that cells in intact tissues may have mechanisms to sense and resist inappropriate dedifferentiation The matched seq and datasets created for this analysis also serve as a resource enabling inquiries into the dynamic and distribution of histone modifications in single cell types in plants View details for DOI View details for PubMedID 31594845 Modulation of Asymmetric Division Diversity through Cytokinin and SPEECHLESS Regulatory Interactions in the Arabidopsis Stomatal Lineage Developmental cell Vaten Soyars Tarr Nimchuk Bergmann 2018 Abstract Coordinated growth of organs requires communication among cells within and between tissues In plants leaf growth is largely dictated by the epidermis here asymmetric and divisions of the stomatal lineage create two essential cell cells and guard proportions reflecting inputs from local systemic and environmental cues The transcription factor SPEECHLESS SPCH is the primeregulator of divisions but whether and how it is influenced by external cues to provide flexible development is enigmatic Here we show that the phytohormone cytokinin CK can act as an endogenous signal to affect the extent and types of stomatal lineage divisions and forms a regulatory circuit withSPCH Local domains of low CK signaling are created by activity of two repressive ARABIDOPSIS RESPONSE REGULATORs ARRs ARR16 and ARR17 and two secreted peptides CLE9 and CLE10 which together with SPCH can customize epidermal composition View details for PubMedID 30197241 Grass stomata Current biology CB McKown Bergmann 2018 28 15 Abstract Stomata are adjustable valves through which gas and water

MAPKKK function in regulation of grass epidermal patterning Development Cambridge England Abrash Anleu Gil Matos Bergmann 2018 Abstract All multicellular organisms must properly pattern cell types to generate functional tissues and organs The organized and predictable cell lineages of the Brachypodium leaf enabled us to characterize the role of the MAPK kinase kinase gene BdYODA1 in regulating asymmetric cell divisions We find that YODA genes promote normal stomatal spacing patterns in both Arabidopsis and Brachypodium despite differences in those patterns Using lineage tracing and cell fate markers we show that unexpectedly patterning defects in bdyoda1 mutants do not arise from faulty physical asymmetry in cell divisions but rather from improper enforcement of alternative cellular fates after division These comparisons allow us to refine our interpretations of MAPK activities during plant asymmetric cell divisions View details for PubMedID 29945871 Direct Control of SPEECHLESS

multicellular organisms The production of epidermal pores required for gas exchange in highly plastic and provides a powerful platform to address environmental influence on cell differentiation Rising temperatures are already impacting plant growth a trend expected to worsen in the near future 4 High temperature inhibits stomatal production but the underlying mechanism is not known 5 Here we show that elevated temperature suppresses the expression of SPEECHLESS SPCH the bHLH transcription factor that serves as the master regulator of stomatal lineage initiation 6 7 Our genetic and expression analyses indicate that the suppression of SPCH and stomatal production is mediated by the bHLH transcription factor FACTOR 4 PIF4 a core component of signaling 8 Importantly we demonstrate that upon exposure to high temperature PIF4 accumulates in the stomatal precursors and binds to the promoter of SPCH In addition we find SPCH feeds back negatively to the PIF4 gene We propose a model where PIF4 binds and represses SPCH expression to restrict stomatal production at elevated temperatures Our work identifies a molecular link connecting signaling and stomatal development and reveals a direct mechanism by which production of a specific cell lineage can be controlled by a broadly expressed environmental signaling factor View details for PubMedID 29628371 View details for PubMedCentralID PMC5931714 Dissection of MAPK signaling specificity through protein engineering in a developmental context BMC PLANT BIOLOGY Wengier Lampard Bergmann 2018 18 60 Abstract protein kinases MAPK signaling affects many processes some of which have different outcomes in the same cell In Arabidopsis activation of a MAPK cascade consisting of YODA and inhibits early stages of stomatal developmental but the ability to halt stomatal progression is lost at the later stage when guard mother cells GMCs transition to guard cells GCs Rather than downregulating cascade components stomatal precursors must have a mechanism to prevent late stage inhibition because the same MKKs and MPKs mediate other physiological artificially activated the MAPK cascade using MKK7 another MKK that can modulate stomatal development and found that inhibition of stomatal development is still possible in GMCs This suggests that but not MKK7 are specifically prevented from inhibiting stomatal development To identify regions of MKKs responsible for specific regulation we used a domain swap approach with MKK7 and a battery of in vitro and in vivo kinase assays We found that regions of MKK5 and MKK7 establish specific connections like they do in other organisms but they do so in combination with previously undescribed modules in the One of these modules encoding the regulation of MKK5 when swapped with sequences from the equivalent region of MKK7 allows MKK5 to mediate robust inhibition of late stomatal MKK structure is conserved across species the identification of new MKK specificity modules and signaling rules furthers our understanding of how eukaryotes create specificity in complex biological systems View details for PubMedID 29636017 and expressed CYCD7 1 coordinates the single symmetric division that creates stomatal guard cells Development Cambridge England Weimer Matos Sharma Patell Murray J Dewitte Bergmann 2018 145 6 Abstract Plants with cells fixed in place by rigid walls often utilize spatial and temporally distinct cell division programs to organize and maintain organs This leads to the question of how developmental regulators interact with the cell cycle machinery to link cell division events with particular developmental trajectories In Arabidopsis leaves the development of stomata epidermal valves that mediate gas exchange relies on a series of oriented stem asymmetric divisions followed by a single symmetric division The stomatal lineage is embedded in a tissue in which other cells transition from proliferation to postmitotic differentiation earlier necessitating stomatal factors to prolong competence to divide We show that the cyclin CYCD7 1 is specifically expressed just prior to the symmetric guard division and that it is limiting for this division Further we find that CYCD7 1 is capable of promoting divisions in multiple contexts likely through promotion of the transition but that CYCD7 1 is regulated at the transcriptional level by cell transcription factors that confine its expression to the appropriate developmental window View details for PubMedID 29467245 Mechanical Forces Influence the Polarity of Stomatal Stem Cells in Arabidopsis CURRENT BIOLOGY Bringmann Bergmann 2017 27 6 Abstract Mechanical information is an important contributor to cell polarity in and multicellular systems In planar tissues like the Drosophila wing cell polarity reorients during growth as cells divide and reorganize 4 In another planar tissue the Arabidopsis leaf epidermis 5 polarized asymmetric divisions of stomatal stem cells meristemoid mother cells MMCs are fundamental for the generation and patterning of multiple cell types including stomata The activity of key transcription factors polarizing factors 6 and peptide signals 7 explains some local stomatal patterns emerging from the behavior of a few lineally related cells 6 Here we demonstrate that in addition to locally acting signals mechanical forces can act as organizing cues and that they do so by influencing the polarity of individual MMCs If the mechanical stress environment in the tissue is altered through stretching or cell ablations cellular polarity changes in response In turn polarity predicts the orientation of cellular and tissue outgrowth leading to increased mechanical conflicts between neighboring cells This interplay among growth oriented divisions and cell specification could contribute to the characteristic patterning of stomatal guard cells in the context of a growing leaf View details for DOI View details for Web of Science ID

cells SCs flanking two guard cells GCs linked to improved stomatal physiology Here we identify a transcription factor necessary and sufficient for SC formation in the wheat relative Brachypodium distachyon Unexpectedly the transcription factor is an ortholog of the stomatal regulator AtMUTE which defines GC precursor fate in Arabidopsis The novel role of BdMUTE in specifying lateral SCs appears linked to its acquisition of mobility in Brachypodium Physiological analyses on plants experimentally support classic hypotheses that SCs permit greater stomatal responsiveness and larger

of gas exchange The New phytologist Dow Berry J Bergmann 2017 216 1 Abstract Stomata are simultaneously tasked with permitting the uptake of carbon dioxide for photosynthesis while limiting water loss from the plant This process is mainly regulated by guard cell control of the stomatal aperture but recent advancements have highlighted the importance of several genes that control stomatal development Using targeted genetic manipulations of the stomatal lineage and a combination of gas exchange and microscopy techniques we show that changes in stomatal development of the epidermal layer lead to coupled changes in the underlying mesophyll tissues This coordinated response tends to match leaf photosynthetic potential Vcmax with capacity gsmax and hence the uptake of carbon dioxide for water lost We found that different genetic regulators systematically altered tissue coordination in separate ways the transcription factor SPEECHLESS SPCH primarily affected leaf size and thickness whereas peptides in the EPIDERMAL PATTERNING FACTOR EPF family altered cell density in the mesophyll It was also determined that interlayer coordination required the receptor TOO MANY MOUTHS TMM These results demonstrate that regulators can alter mesophyll properties which provides insight into how molecular pathways can organize leaf tissues to coordinate gas exchange and suggests new strategies

Caine Tomek Wallace Kamisugi Cuming Lang MacAlister Casson Bergmann Decker Frank Gray Fleming Reski Beerling J 2016 2 Abstract Stomata are microscopic valves on plant surfaces that originated over 400 million years Myr ago and facilitated the greening of Earth continents by permitting efficient gas exchange and plant hydration 1 However the core genetic machinery regulating stomatal development in land plants is poorly understood and their function has remained a matter of debate for a century 5 Here we show that genes encoding the two basic proteins PpSMF1 SPEECH MUTE and and PpSCREAM1 SCRM1 in the moss Physcomitrella patens are orthologous to transcriptional regulators of stomatal development in the flowering plant Arabidopsis thaliana and essential for stomata formation in moss Targeted patens knockout mutants lacking either PpSMF1 or PpSCRM1 develop gametophytes indistinguishable from plants but mutant sporophytes lack stomata interaction assays reveal heterodimerization between PpSMF1 and PpSCRM1 which together with gene complementations 6 suggests deep functional conservation of the heterodimeric SMF1 and SCRM1 unit is required to activate transcription for moss stomatal development as in thaliana 7 Moreover sporophytes of ΔPpSMF1 and ΔPpSCRM1 mutants exhibited delayed dehiscence implying stomata might have promoted dehiscence in the first complex sporophytes View

organisms In Arabidopsis stomatal lineage ACDs are regulated by the protein BREAKING OF ASYMMETRY IN THE STOMATAL LINEAGE BASL BASL exhibits dynamic subcellular localization accumulating initially in the nucleus but then additionally in a highly polarized crescent at the cell cortex before division BASL polarization requires a activation process but how this is achieved remains unknown In this study we performed a dissection of BASL protein subdomains and elucidated a nuclear localization sequence for nuclear import and a critical FxFP motif for cortical polarity formation respectively Artificially tethering BASL subdomains to the plasma membrane suggests that novel protein might exist and bind to an internal region of BASL In addition we suspect the existence of a protein degradation mechanism associated with the amino terminal domain of BASL that accounts for restricting its predominant expression to the stomatal lineage cells of the epidermis Taken together our results revealed that BASL through its distinct subdomains integrates multiple regulatory inputs to provide a mechanism that promotes difference during stomatal lineage ACDs View details for DOI View

regulating stomatal development were identified in Arabidopsis but this dicot developmental pattern and stomatal morphology represent only one of many possibilities in nature Here using unbiased forward genetic screens followed by analysis of reporters and engineered mutants we show that stomatal initiation in the grass Brachypodium distachyon uses orthologs of stomatal regulators known from Arabidopsis but that the function and behavior of individual genes the relationships among genes and the regulation of their protein products have diverged Our results highlight ways in which a kernel of conserved genes may be alternatively wired to produce diversity in patterning and morphology and suggest that the stomatal transcription factor module is a prime target for breeding or genome

individual cell types in the Arabidopsis thaliana stomatal lineage and identify CSLD5 a member of the Cellulose Synthase family as a cell wall biosynthesis enzyme uniquely enriched in rapidly dividing cell populations We further show that CSLD5 is a direct target of SPEECHLESS the master transcriptional regulator of these divisions during stomatal development Using a combination of genetic analysis and in vivo localization of fluorescently tagged fusion proteins we show that CSLD5 preferentially accumulates in dividing plant cells where it participates in the construction of newly forming cell plates We show that CSLD5 is an unstable protein that is rapidly degraded upon completion of cell division and that the protein turnover characteristics of CSLD5 are altered in ccs52a2 mutants

changes Temporal dissections of transcriptome changes however are rare for intact developing tissues We used RNA sequencing and microarray platforms to quantify gene expression from labeled cells isolated by cell sorting to generate transcriptomes during development of an adult lineage in the Arabidopsis leaf We show that regulatory modules in this early lineage link cell types that had previously been considered to be under separate control and provide evidence for recruitment of individual members of gene families for different developmental decisions Because stomata are physiologically important and because stomatal lineage cells exhibit exemplary division cell fate and cell signaling behaviors this dataset serves as a valuable resource for further investigations of

Kumari Jewaria Bergmann Kakimoto 2014 55 12 Abstract Plants which are sessile unlike most animals have evolved a system to reduce growth under stress however the molecular mechanisms of this stress response are not well known During programmed development a fraction of the leaf epidermal precursor cells become meristemoid mother cells MMCs which are stem cells that produce both stomatal guard cells and epidermal pavement cells Here we report that Arabidopsis plants in response to osmotic stress decrease the protein level of SPEECHLESS the transcription factor promoting MMC identity through the action of a protein kinase MAPK cascade The growth reduction under osmotic stress was lessened by inhibition of the MAPK cascade or by a mutation that disrupted the MAPK target amino acids in SPEECHLESS indicating that Arabidopsis reduces growth under stress by integrating the osmotic stress signal into the core developmental pathway View details for DOI View details for PubMedID 25381317

opposing outcomes mechanisms to enforce signaling specificity are of utmost importance These mechanisms are largely uncharacterized in plant MAPK signaling networks The Arabidopsis thaliana stomatal lineage was previously used to show that when rendered constitutively active four MAPK kinases MKKs are capable of perturbing stomatal development and that these kinases comprise two pairs and with both overlapping and divergent functions We characterized the contributions of specific structural domains of these four stomatal MKKs to MAPK signaling output and specificity both in vitro and in

that facilitate gas exchange is highly coordinated with other aspects of photosynthetic development The signalling pathways controlling stomata development are not fully understood although protein kinase MAPK signalling is known to have key roles Here we demonstrate in Arabidopsis that brassinosteroid regulates stomatal development by activating the MAPK kinase kinase MAPKKK YDA also known as YODA Genetic analyses indicate that receptor brassinosteroid signalling inhibits stomatal development through the glycogen synthase kinase 3 GSK3 kinase BIN2 and BIN2 acts upstream of YDA but downstream of the ERECTA family of receptor kinases Complementary in vitro and in vivo assays show that BIN2 phosphorylates YDA to inhibit YDA phosphorylation of its substrate MKK4 and that activities of downstream MAPKs are reduced in mutants but increased by treatment with either brassinosteroid or inhibitor Our results indicate that brassinosteroid inhibits stomatal development by alleviating

created through a stereotyped series of symmetric and asymmetric cell divisions whose frequency and orientation are informed by interactions proteins and a protein kinase kinase kinase were previously identified as negative regulators of stomatal development here we present the characterization of a bona fide positive regulator FAMA is a putative basic transcription factor whose activity is required to promote differentiation of stomatal guard cells and to halt proliferative divisions in their immediate precursors Ectopic FAMA expression is also sufficient to confer stomatal character Physical and genetic interaction studies combined with functional characterization of FAMA domains suggest that stomatal development relies on regulatory complexes distinct from those used to specify other plant epidermal cells FAMA behavior provides insights into the control of differentiation in cells produced through the activity of populations View details for DOI View details for Web of

Bergmann 2006 9 5 Abstract Stomata are epidermal structures that are responsible for modulating the exchange of gases between the plant and the environment Stomata are formed and patterned by asymmetric cell divisions The number and orientation of these asymmetric divisions is informed by plant intrinsic signals acting locally among epidermal cells or at a distance from mature to young leaves and by plant extrinsic factors such as the quantity of light water and CO 2 in the atmosphere Recent studies have implicated a set of conserved cell surface receptors and intracellular signaling molecules in the perception and response to developmental cues Complementary studies have probed the nature of environmental signals and how these signals are transduced from the site of perception to the cells in the stomatal lineage View details for DOI View details for Web of Science ID 000240795900006 View details for PubMedID 16890476 Stomatal development and pattern controlled by a MAPKK kinase SCIENCE Bergmann Lukowitz Somerville 2004 304 5676 Abstract Stomata are epidermal structures that modulate gas exchange between a plant and its environment During development stomata are specified and positioned nonrandomly by the integration of asymmetric cell divisions and intercellular signaling The Arabidopsis protein kinase kinase kinase gene YODA acts as part of a molecular switch controlling cell identities in the epidermis Null mutations in YODA lead to excess stomata whereas constitutive activation of YODA eliminated stomata Transcriptome analysis of seedlings with altered YODA activity was used to identify potential stomatal regulatory genes A putative transcription factor from this set was shown to regulate the developmental behavior of stomatal precursors

are specialized epidermal structures that control the exchange of water and carbon dioxide between the plant and the atmosphere The classical developmental mechanisms that define cell fate and tissue patterning cell lineage interactions and signals from a distance are employed to make stomata and to define their density and distribution within the epidermis Recent work has shown that two genes that are involved in stomatal pattern may encode components of a classical signaling cascade Additional work has suggested that signals from the overlying cuticle and the underlying mesophyll also influence stomatal pattern These findings highlight the need for models that explain how the signals that regulate stomatal development are integrated and how they act to regulate cell polarity the
