Academic medicine journal of the Association of American Medical Colleges Gallahue Deiorio Blomkalns Bird Dunleavy Fraser Overton 2020 95 11 Abstract Calls to change the residency selection process have increased in recent years with many focusing on the need for holistic review and alternatives to academic metrics One aspect of applicant performance to consider in holistic review is proficiency in behavioral competencies The Association of American Medical Colleges AAMC developed the AAMC Standardized Video Interview SVI an online asynchronous video interview that assesses applicants knowledge of professionalism and their interpersonal and communication skills The AAMC worked with the emergency medicine community to pilot the SVI Data from 4 years of research Electronic Residency Application Service ERAS cycles show the SVI is a reliable valid assessment of these behavioral competencies It provides information not available in the ERAS application packet and it does not disadvantage individuals or groups Yet despite the SVI psychometric properties the AAMC elected not to renew or expand the pilot in residency this Invited Commentary the authors share lessons learned from the AAMC SVI project about introducing a new tool for use in residency selection They recommend that future projects endeavoring to find ways to support holistic review engage all stakeholders from the start communicate the value of the new tool early and often make direct comparisons with existing tools give new tools time and space to succeed strike a balance between early adopters and broad participation help stakeholders understand the limitations of what a tool can do and set clear expectations about both stakeholder input and pricing They encourage the medical education community to learn from the SVI project and to consider future partnerships with the AAMC or other specialty organizations to develop new tools and approaches that prioritize the community needs Finding solutions to the challenges facing residency selection should be a priority for all stakeholders View details for DOI View details for PubMedID 33112586 Assessment of Sensitivity and

the prevalence of physician burnout ranges anywhere from 0 to 80 Emergency medicine is often cited as the specialty with some of the highest reported levels of physician Regardless of what the true prevalence of physician burnout may be most of these studies suggest the presence of a crisis The detrimental impact of burnout on physicians is certainly of interest to physicians What is missing

Levy Singer Shapiro Cheng Cannon Blomkalns Walters Christenson Nowak Lurie Pang Kastner Masson Gibson Gaggin Januzzi 2020 Abstract AIMS Concentrations of growth factor binding IGFBP7 have been linked to abnormal cardiac structure and function in patients with chronic heart failure HF but cardiovascular correlates of the biomarker in patients with more acute presentations are lacking We aimed to determine the relationship between IGFBP7 concentrations and cardiac structure and to evaluate the impact of IGFBP7 on the diagnosis of acute HF among patients with acute AND RESULTS In this subgroup analysis of the International Collaborative of Natriuretic Peptide of Acute Diagnostic in the Emergency Department study we included 271 patients with and without acute HF All patients presented to an emergency department with acute dyspnoea had blood samples for IGFBP7 measurement and detailed echocardiographic evaluation Higher IGFBP7 concentrations were associated with numerous cardiac abnormalities including increased left atrial volume index LAVi P lower left ventricular ejection fraction P lower right ventricular fractional area change P and higher tissue Doppler ratio P In multivariable linear regression analyses increased LAVi lower estimated glomerular filtration rate higher body mass index diabetes and higher concentrations of natriuretic peptide were independently associated with higher IGFBP7 concentrations regardless of other variables Furthermore IGFBP7 odds 95 confidence interval was found to be independently associated with the diagnosis of acute HF in the multivariable logistic regression Among acute dyspnoeic patients with and without acute HF increased IGFBP7 concentrations are associated with a range of cardiac structure and function abnormalities Independent association with increased LAVi suggests elevated left ventricular filling pressure is an important trigger for IGFBP7 expression and release IGFBP7 may enhance the diagnosis of acute HF

skills important for success in residency The authors evaluated the feasibility of the AAMC Standardized Video Interview SVI and evidence of the validity of SVI total The SVI developed by the Association of American Medical Colleges consists of six questions designed to assess applicants interpersonal and communication skills and knowledge of professionalism Study 1 was conducted in 2016 for research purposes Study 2 was an operational pilot administration in 2017 SVI data were available for residency selection use by emergency medicine residency programs for the 2018 application cycle Descriptive statistics correlations and standardized mean differences were used to examine Study 1 included 855 applicants Study 2 included applicants SVI total scores were relatively normally distributed There were small correlations between SVI total scores and United States Medical Licensing Examination Step exam scores Alpha Omega Alpha Honor Medical Society membership and Gold Humanism Honor Society membership There were group differences in SVI total scores by gender and and differences by applicant Findings provide initial evidence of the validity of SVI total scores and suggest these scores provide different information than academic metrics Use of the SVI as part of a holistic screening process may help program directors widen the pool of applicants invited to interviews and may signal that programs value interpersonal and communication skills and professionalism View details for PubMedID 30870151 Making Promotion Count The Gender Perspective ACADEMIC EMERGENCY

of physiology Heart and circulatory physiology Kim Blomkalns Ogbi Thomas Gavrila Neltner Cassis Thompson Weiss Lindower Blanco McCormick Daugherty Fu Hazen Stansfield Huo Fulton Chatterjee Weintraub 2017 313 6 Abstract Oxidative stress plays a fundamental role in abdominal aortic aneurysm AAA formation Activated polymorphonuclear leukocytes or neutrophils are associated with AAA and express myeloperoxidase MPO which promotes inflammation matrix degradation and other pathological features of AAA including enhanced oxidative stress through generation of reactive oxygen species Both plasma and aortic MPO levels are elevated in patients with AAA but the role of MPO in AAA pathogenesis has heretofore never been investigated Here we show that MPO gene deletion attenuates AAA formation in two animal models ANG II infusion in apolipoprotein mice and elastase perfusion in mice Oral administration of taurine 1 or 4 in drinking water an amino acid known to react rapidly with oxidants like hypochlorous acid also prevented AAA formation in the ANG II and elastase models as well as the CaCl2 application model of AAA formation while reducing aortic peroxidase activity and aortic dityrosine levels an oxidative cross link formed by MPO Both MPO gene deletion and taurine supplementation blunted aortic macrophage accumulation elastin fragmentation and matrix metalloproteinase activation key features of AAA pathogenesis Moreover MPO gene deletion and taurine administration significantly attenuated the induction of serum amyloid A which promotes ANG AAAs These data implicate MPO in AAA pathogenesis and suggest that studies exploring whether taurine can serve as a potential therapeutic for the prevention or treatment of AAA in patients merit NOTEWORTHY Neutrophils are abundant in abdominal aortic aneurysm AAA and myeloperoxidase MPO prominently expressed in neutrophils is associated with AAA in humans This study demonstrates that MPO gene deletion or supplementation with the natural product taurine which can scavenge oxidants can prevent AAA formation suggesting an attractive potential therapeutic strategy for AAA View details for DOI View details for PubMedID 28971841

Blanco Palascak Franco Tong Chatterjee Hui Davidson Aronow Kalfa Manka Peairs Blomkalns Fulton Brittain Weintraub Bogdanov Y 2015 132 20 Abstract diet HFD promotes endothelial dysfunction and proinflammatory monocyte activation which contribute to atherosclerosis in obesity We investigated whether HFD also induces the dysfunction of red blood cells RBCs which serve as a reservoir for chemokines via binding to Duffy antigen receptor for chemokines DARC 60 HFD for 12 weeks which produced only minor changes in lipid profile in mice markedly augmented the levels of monocyte chemoattractant bound to RBCs which in turn stimulated macrophage migration through an endothelial monolayer Levels of KC were also increased by HFD These effects of HFD were abolished in DARC mice In RBCs from and DARC mice levels of membrane cholesterol and phosphatidylserine externalization were increased fostering inflammatory interactions and promoting macrophage phagocytosis in vitro When labeled ex vivo and injected into mice RBCs from mice exhibited increase in splenic uptake Finally RBCs from mice induced increased macrophage adhesion to the endothelium when they were incubated with isolated aortic segments indicating endothelial dysfunction analogous to endothelial dysfunction occurs early during obesity and may serve as a mediator of atherosclerosis These findings may have

edited by Brown 2015 Localization identification and excision of murine adipose depots Journal of visualized experiments JoVE Mann Thompson Robbins Blomkalns 2014 Abstract Obesity has increased dramatically in the last few decades and affects over one third of the adult US population The economic effect of obesity in 2005 reached a staggering sum of billion in direct medical costs alone Obesity is a major risk factor for a wide host of diseases Historically little was known regarding adipose and its major and essential functions in the body Brown and white adipose are the two main types of adipose but current literature has identified a new type of fat called brite or beige adipose Research has shown that adipose depots have specific metabolic profiles and certain depots allow for a propensity for obesity and other related disorders The goal of this protocol is to provide researchers the capacity to identify and excise adipose depots that will allow for the analysis of different factorial effects on adipose as well as the beneficial or detrimental role adipose plays in disease and overall health Isolation and excision of adipose depots allows investigators to look at gross morphological changes as well as histological changes The adipose isolated can also be used for molecular studies to evaluate transcriptional and translational change or for in vitro experimentation to discover targets of interest and mechanisms of action This technique is superior to other published techniques due to the design allowing for isolation of multiple depots with simplicity and minimal contamination View details for DOI View details for PubMedID 25549006 View details for PubMedCentralID PMC4396874 Transplanted perivascular adipose tissue accelerates neointimal

Abstract Perivascular adipose tissue PVAT expands during obesity is highly inflamed and correlates with coronary plaque burden and increased cardiovascular risk We tested the hypothesis that PVAT contributes to the vascular response to wire injury and investigated the underlying transplanted thoracic aortic PVAT from donor mice fed a diet to the carotid arteries of recipient lipoprotein receptor knockout mice Two weeks after transplantation wire injury was performed and animals were euthanized 2 weeks later Immunohistochemistry was performed to quantify adventitial macrophage infiltration and neovascularization and neointimal lesion composition and size Transplanted PVAT accelerated neointimal hyperplasia adventitial macrophage infiltration and adventitial angiogenesis The majority of neointimal cells in animals expressed muscle actin consistent with smooth muscle phenotype Deletion of monocyte chemoattractant in PVAT substantially attenuated the effects of fat transplantation on neointimal hyperplasia and adventitial angiogenesis but not adventitial macrophage infiltration Conditioned medium from perivascular adipocytes induced potent monocyte chemotaxis in vitro and angiogenic responses in cultured endothelial findings indicate that PVAT contributes to the vascular response to wire injury in part through monocyte chemoattractant mechanisms View details

Diabetes Chatterjee Basford Knoll Tong Blanco Blomkalns Rudich Lentsch A Hui Weintraub 2014 63 1 Abstract During chronic caloric excess adipose tissue expands primarily by enlargement of individual adipocytes which become stressed with lipid overloading thereby contributing to disease Although adipose tissue contains numerous preadipocytes differentiation into functionally competent adipocytes is insufficient to accommodate the chronic caloric excess and prevent adipocyte overloading We report for the first time that a chronic diet HFD impairs adipogenic differentiation leading to accumulation of inefficiently differentiated adipocytes with blunted expression of adipogenic genes Preadipocytes from these mice likewise exhibit impaired adipogenic differentiation and this phenotype persists during in vitro cell culture impaired adipogenic differentiation is associated with elevated expression of histone deacetylase 9 HDAC9 an endogenous negative regulator of adipogenic differentiation Genetic ablation of HDAC9 improves adipogenic differentiation and systemic metabolic state during an HFD resulting in diminished weight gain improved glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity and reduced hepatosteatosis Moreover compared with mice HDAC9 knockout mice exhibit upregulated expression of beige adipocyte marker genes particularly during an HFD in association with increased energy expenditure and adaptive thermogenesis These results suggest that targeting HDAC9 may be an effective strategy for combating metabolic disease View details for DOI View details for

Robbins Thompson Mann Blomkalns 2014 e52172 Abstract Cardiovascular disease is a broad term describing disease of the heart blood vessels The main blood vessel supplying the body with oxygenated blood is the aorta The aorta may become affected in diseases such as atherosclerosis and aneurysm Researchers investigating these diseases would benefit from direct observation of the aorta to characterize disease progression as well as to evaluate efficacy of potential therapeutics The goal of this protocol is to describe proper isolation and excision of the aorta to aid investigators researching cardiovascular disease Isolation and excision of the aorta allows investigators to look at gross morphometric changes as wells as allowing them to preserve and stain the tissue to look at histologic changes if desired The aorta may be used for molecular studies to evaluate protein and gene expression to discover targets of interest and mechanisms of action This technique is superior to imaging modalities as they have inherent limitations in technology and cost Additionally primary isolated cells from a freshly isolated and excised aorta can allowing researchers to perform further in situ and in vitro assays The isolation and excision of the aorta has the limitation of having to sacrifice the animal however in this case the benefits outweigh the harm as it is the most versatile technique in the study of aortic disease View details for DOI View details for PubMedID 25490214 View details for PubMedCentralID PMC4354289 CD14 directs adventitial macrophage precursor recruitment

Thompson Weiss Lindower Pinney Chatterjee Weintraub 2013 2 2 e000065 Abstract Recruitment of macrophage precursors to the adventitia plays a key role in the pathogenesis of abdominal aortic aneurysms AAAs but molecular mechanisms remain undefined The innate immune signaling molecule CD14 was reported to be upregulated in adventitial macrophages in a murine model of AAA and in monocytes cocultured with aortic adventitial fibroblasts AoAf in vitro concurrent with increased expression We hypothesized that CD14 plays a crucial role in adventitial macrophage precursor recruitment early during AAA mice were resistant to AAA formation induced by 2 different AAA induction models aortic elastase infusion and systemic angiotensin II AngII infusion CD14 gene deletion led to reduced aortic macrophage infiltration and diminished elastin degradation Adventitial monocyte binding to aorta in vitro was dependent on CD14 and incubation of human acute monocytic leukemia cell monocytes with or conditioned medium from perivascular adipose tissue PVAT upregulated CD14 expression Conditioned medium from AoAf and PVAT induced monocyte chemotaxis which was potentiated by CD14 expression in aorta and plasma CD14 levels were increased in AAA patients compared with findings link CD14 innate immune signaling via a novel amplification loop to adventitial macrophage precursor recruitment in the pathogenesis

vascular morphology inflammation and hemostasis Physiological genomics Chatterjee Aronow Tong Manka Tang Bogdanov Unruh Blomkalns Piegore Weintraub Rudich Kuhel Hui Weintraub 2013 45 16 Abstract Inflammatory cross talk between perivascular adipose tissue and the blood vessel wall has been proposed to contribute to the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis We previously reported that human perivascular PV adipocytes exhibit a proinflammatory phenotype and less adipogenic differentiation than do subcutaneous SQ adipocytes To gain a global view of the genomic basis of biologic differences between PV and SQ adipocytes we performed expression analyses to identify differentially expressed genes between adipocytes derived from human SQ PV adipose tissues Although 90 of genes were similarly regulated we identified a signature of 307 differentially expressed genes that were highly enriched for functions associated with the regulation of angiogenesis vascular morphology inflammation and blood clotting Of the 156 PV upregulated genes 59 associate with angiogenesis vascular biology or inflammation noteworthy of which include TNFRSF11B osteoprotegerin PLAT TGFB1 THBS2 HIF1A GATA6 and SERPINE1 Of 166 PV downregulated genes 21 associated with vascular biology and inflammation including ANGPT1 ANGPTL1 and VEGFC Consistent with the emergent hypothesis that PV adipocytes differentially regulate angiogenesis and inflammation cell media from PV adipocytes strongly enhanced endothelial cell tubulogenesis and monocyte migration compared with media from SQ adipocytes These findings demonstrate that PV adipocytes have the potential to significantly modulate vascular inflammatory crosstalk in the setting of atherosclerosis by their ability to signal to both endothelial and inflammatory cells View details for DOI View details for PubMedID 23737535 View details for PubMedCentralID PMC3742916 Cardiac Imaging and Stress Testing 2e Emergency Medicine Executive edited by

inflammation London England Blomkalns Stoll Shaheen Dickson Weintraub Denning 2011 8 4 Abstract Bacterial endotoxin long recognized as a potent mediator in acute infectious processes has more recently been identified as a risk factor for atherosclerosis and other cardiovascular diseases When endotoxin enters the bloodstream one of the first cells activated is the circulating monocyte which exhibits a wide range of studied the effect of low doses of coli LPS on release and superoxide formation by freshly isolated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells PBMC release was consistently detectable at 10 of endotoxin reaching a maximum at 1 and was exclusively produced by monocytes the lymphocytes neither produced nor affected monocyte release Superoxide production was detectable at 30 of endotoxin reaching a maximum at 3 Peak respiratory burst activity was seen at min and superoxide levels returned to baseline by 1 release was dependent on both CD14 mCD14 and receptor 4 TLR4 Superoxide production was dependent on the presence of LBP but was not significantly affected by a blocking antibody to TLR4 Moreover treatment with lovastatin inhibited release and superoxide findings suggest that release and the respiratory burst are regulated by distinct signaling pathways in PBMC in low level of endotoxin exposure Selectively modulating these pathways could lead to new approaches to treat chronic inflammatory diseases such as atherosclerosis while preserving the capacity of monocytes to respond to acute bacterial infections View details for DOI View details for PubMedID 21352551

results into routine clinical practice remains difficult Guidelines such as the 2002 American College of Heart Association Guidelines for the Management of Patients with Unstable Angina and elevation myocardial infarction have been developed to provide a streamlined approach to patient care that is of high quality and is reproducible The Can Rapid Risk Stratification of Unstable Angina Patients Suppress ADverse Outcomes with Early Implementation CRUSADE Quality Improvement Initiative was developed as a registry for elevation acute coronary syndromes to track the use of acute and discharge treatments for hospitalized patients as well as outcomes associated with the use of these treatments Care for more than patients at more than 400 acute care hospitals in the United States was tracked in CRUSADE with feedback provided to participating physicians and hospitals regarding their performance over time and compared with similar institutions Such access to data has proved important in stimulating improvements in elevation acute coronary syndromes care at participating hospitals for delivery of acute and discharge therapy as well as improving outcomes for patients Providing quality improvement methods such as protocol order sets continuing education programs and a CRUSADE Quality Improvement Initiative toolbox serve to actively stimulate physician providers and institutions to improve care The CRUSADE Initiative has also proven to be a fertile source of research in translation of treatment guidelines into routine care resulting in more than 52 published articles and 86 abstracts presented at major emergency medicine and cardiology meetings The cycle for research of guideline implementation demonstrated by CRUSADE includes four major steps observation intervention investigation and publication that serve as the basis for evaluating the impact of any guideline on patient care Due to the success of CRUSADE the American College of Cardiology combined the CRUSADE

accuracy of their own risk perception Preventive medicine Williams Lindsell Rue Blomkalns A 2007 44 6 Abstract Coronary artery disease CAD is the single largest killer of both males and females in the United States The Emergency Department ED represents a unique environment in which patient education may improve coronary artery disease risk factor knowledge and relative risk perception ED patients understanding of CAD risk factors is often limited Patients perception of their own risk is often not a reflection of their true risk We hypothesized that an American Heart Association educational video intervention would improve patients knowledge of coronary artery disease risk factors and personal risk awareness in the ED approval was obtained for this prospective observational cohort study Our trial included 100 adult patients age 18 and over both male and female using the ED population at an inner city tertiary care Level I trauma center hospital as our source of participants Recruitment of patients began in January 2002 and ended in May who watched the educational video did improve their knowledge of cardiac risk factors significantly when compared to patients who received no educational video intervention In our study this information was not retained at However there was still significant improvement in their knowledge when compared to baseline scores Patients overestimated their risk when compared to an objective measure of risk In both the study and control groups patients significantly overestimated their risk intervention immediately intervention and at when compared to an objective measure of educational intervention at a teachable moment when a patient is experiencing chest pain in the ED significantly improves patient knowledge of CAD risk factors immediately This improvement in knowledge is not fully retained at which suggests that patients may benefit from further educational intervention prior to 1 month Patients overestimate their risk when compared to an objective measure of risk regardless of whether they receive an educational intervention or not View details for DOI View details for PubMedID 17336373

any relation among delayed ECG acquisition treatment patterns and clinical outcomes We therefore analyzed data from patients women 42 with elevation acute coronary syndromes designated by positive cardiac markers ischemic changes who were enrolled in the CRUSADE Quality Improvement Initiative from February 2001 to March 2004 Patients were categorized based on time to electrocardiography as delayed 10 minutes from hospital arrival or nondelayed 10 minutes Multivariable predictors of delayed ECG acquisition were determined Overall median time to electrocardiography was 15 minutes 25th to 75th percentile 7 to 32 ECG acquisition was delayed median 25 minutes 25th to 75th percentile 16 to 50 in patients In the remaining time to electrocardiography was 10 minutes median 5 minutes 25th to 75th percentile 3 to 8 Women were more likely than men to have delayed ECG acquisition 69 vs 62 and female gender was the most significant predictor of delayed ECG acquisition odds ratio 95 confidence interval to In conclusion only 33 of patients with elevation acute coronary syndrome had an initial electrocardiogram obtained 10 minutes of arrival as recommended Women were significantly more likely

the challenges of the 21st century The Keio journal of medicine Williams Blomkalns Gibler B 2004 53 4 Abstract Emergency Medicine is a relatively young specialty in the United States as well as in other parts of the world It was only 36 years ago in 1968 that the American College of Emergency Physicians was founded Two years later the University of Cincinnati in Cincinnati Ohio USA launched the first Emergency Medicine Residency Training Program Until the inception of this program staffing of Emergency Rooms consisted largely of physicians who were not trained in the specialty of Emergency Medicine Emergency Medicine Residency training programs fulfill the need to have Emergency Medicine trained physicians staffing Emergency Departments There are three and four year training formats for Emergency Medicine in the United States The University of Cincinnati program is a full program which teaches residents to master the many diagnostic procedural and interpersonal skills required of Emergency Medicine physicians Diagnostic skills must encompass the pathology affecting all organ systems in all age groups and both sexes Procedural skills include airway management vascular access cavity access and wound repair Interpersonal skills are demanding as well requiring of the Emergency Department care team immediate patient rapport and dealing with grief The Residency Review Committee of the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education ACGME ensures that all programs have a structured curriculum complete with both didactic and bedside teaching as well as structured methods for evaluation of both residents and faculty According to manpower studies a great need still exists for Emergency Physicians in many United States hospitals particularly in rural

undifferentiated chest pain population presenting to emergency departments EDs The authors hypothesized that specific ECG findings other than those previously identified in populations would be predictive of cardiac outcomes and positive cardiac study used data from a prospectively collected retrospectively analyzed data registry of undifferentiated chest pain patients i trACS Logistic regression modeling was performed to determine the ECG findings that were predictive of 1 positive cardiac markers and 2 adverse cardiac elevation STE depression STD pathological PQW and inversion were associated with increased odds of percutaneous coronary intervention or catheterization myocardial infarction or coronary artery bypass grafting The odds of creatine measuring positive were increased if STE STD or PQW were present odds ratio OR and respectively A right bundle branch block tended to decrease the odds of measuring positive OR A similar pattern of results was observed for troponin I OR for STE for STD for PQW Troponin T showed an increased odds of measuring positive if any of STE STD left bundle branch block or inversion were evident OR and respectively ECG criteria

million patients with chest pain per year Nearly 4 million of these individuals are admitted to inpatient units for further evaluation and treatment but only 30 of these admitted patients ultimately have the diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome ACS Previously the initial evaluation of patients with chest discomfort presenting to the emergency department ED involved the triad of history physical and ECG Current evidence demonstrates that a fourth element cardiac markers serves as a valuable aid in not only determining initial diagnosis but also providing risk stratification and dictating initial patient treatment Chest pain units CPUs using serial marker determinations have been successful in identifying patients with or at risk for adverse cardiac events in a timely and efficient manner New POCT of cardiac markers at the patient bedside allows for even more timely determination This article will review the use of cardiac markers in heterogeneous patients presenting to EDs with chest discomfort We will focus on the use of markers in the risk stratification and initial treatment of the ED chest pain population and emphasize the role of CPUs and POCT View details for PubMedID
