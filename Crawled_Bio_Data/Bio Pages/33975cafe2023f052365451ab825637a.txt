Urology Current Research and Scholarly Interests My research focuses on outcomes in treatment of muscle invasive and invasive bladder cancer This includes identifying markers of prognosis predictive markers for response to surgery and chemotherapy and working toward an individualized multidisciplinary approach to disease management We are particularly interested in the impact of surgical quality measures on outcome for patients with invasive disease I have also focused on optimizing the use of lower urinary tract reconstruction in patients undergoing cystectomy and identifying interventions to improve patient quality of life This has included a large prospective randomized study of two alternative forms of continent neobladder and evaluating the effect of prior radiation or chemotherapy on the outcome with this surgery We continue to follow these patients long term to evaluate renal function and complications and to mine the rich data from this trial to better understand the long term outcomes with this reconstructive surgery We are also using the outcomes of this trial to design early interventions to avoid complications and improve patient quality of life after the operation Clinical Trials Modern Immunotherapy in Urothelial Carcinoma of the Bladder Not Recruiting A MAMS phase study Phase 1 will be conducted in NMIBC patients to establish the safety of durvalumab monotherapy cohort 1 and durvalumab in combination with BCG cohort 2a and external beam radiation therapy EBRT cohort 2b Provided safety is demonstrated and recommended phase 2 doses RP2D are established in phase 1 the study will proceed to phase 2 testing Phase 2 will be conducted in the or persistent NMIBC population In phase 2 or persistent NMIBC subjects will be randomized between treatment arms examining intravesical BCG in combination with novel immunotherapy agents durvalumab novel immunotherapy in combination with radiation durvalumab EBRT or retreatment with intravesical BCG In addition to providing additional safety data on the combination regimens studied phase 2 will provide preliminary efficacy profiles for or persistent NMIBC subjects with and without CIS treated with each regimen For regimens demonstrating a tolerable safety profile and encouraging clinical activity in this phase design a randomized phase 3 trial of experimental arm therapy versus with intravesical BCG therapy would be considered Stanford is currently not accepting patients for this trial For more information please contact Ned Realiza View full details Atezolizumab in Treating Patients With Recurrent Invasive Bladder Cancer Not Recruiting This phase II trial studies how well atezolizumab works in treating patients with invasive bladder cancer that has come back recurrent

A Randomized Trial Not Recruiting This is a randomized trial evaluating oncologic perioperative and functional outcomes following two standard care procedures for radical cystectomy The participants will have one of the standard care procedures as part of their care The two procedures that will be followed are open radical cystectomy and robotic assisted radical cystectomy RARC Open cystectomy is considered to be the more traditional approach While newer RARC is considered to be equivalent to open surgery when it is performed by a trained robotics surgeon The reported complication rates of RARC appear comparable to open surgery This means there is no significant difference in the risk between the two standard procedures However despite these potential advantages true comparison between the open and robotic technique with regards to long term cancer related and functional outcomes has not been accomplished because previous studies did not compare patients of equal health status The researchers hope to learn whether or not patients undergoing RARC recover more quickly than or at the same rate as patients undergoing an open radical cystectomy while having non inferior cancer

Urologic oncology Bhambhvani Zamora Shkolyar Prado Greenberg Kasman Liao Shah Srinivas Skinner Shah J B 2020 Abstract PURPOSE When exploring survival outcomes for patients with bladder cancer most studies rely on conventional statistical methods such as proportional hazards models Given the successful application of machine learning to handle big data in many disciplines outside of medicine we sought to determine if machine learning could be used to improve our ability to predict survival in bladder cancer patients We compare the performance of artificial neural networks ANN a type of machine learning algorithm with that of multivariable Cox proportional hazards CPH models in the prediction of survival DSS and overall survival OS in patients with bladder AND METHODS The National Cancer Institute Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results SEER 18 program database was queried to identify adult patients with bladder cancer diagnosed between 1995 and 2010 yielding patients who met our inclusion criteria ANNs were trained and tested on an split of the dataset Multivariable CPH models were developed in parallel Variables used for prediction included age sex race grade SEER stage tumor size lymph node involvement degree of extension and surgery received The primary outcomes were DSS and OS Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was conducted and ANN models were tested for The area under the curve for the ANN models was for the OS model and for the DSS model Area under the curve for the CPH models was for OS and for DSS The ANN OS model achieved a calibration slope of and a calibration intercept of while the ANN DSS model achieved a calibration slope of and a calibration intercept of Machine learning algorithms can improve our ability to predict bladder cancer prognosis Compared to CPH models ANNs predicted OS more accurately and DSS with similar accuracy Given the inherent limitations of administrative datasets machine learning may allow for optimal

maintenance of pneumoperitoneum were excluded Patients were centrally assigned via a system with block randomisation by institution stratified by type of urinary diversion clinical T stage and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status to receive radical cystectomy or open radical cystectomy with extracorporeal urinary diversion Treatment allocation was only masked from pathologists The primary endpoint was survival with established if the lower bound of the CI for the treatment difference robotic cystectomy minus open cystectomy was greater than percentage points The primary analysis was done in the population Safety was assessed in the same population This trial is registered with number July 1 2011 and Nov 18 2014 350 participants were randomly assigned to treatment The

Urothelial cancer which is predominantly seen in men is common throughout the world Most disease presents as invasive bladder cancer NMIBC with cancer recurring or progressing to muscle invasive disease in more than 50 of patients after initial therapy NMIBC is an immune responsive disease as indicated by the use of intravesical bacillus as treatment for more than 3 decades The advent of checkpoint inhibitors especially those directed at programmed death 1 and its ligand has had a significant impact on the therapy of advanced urothelial cancer This had led to a revisitation of immunotherapy in urothelial cancer as well as the genesis of trials using novel immunotherapeutic agents This review focuses on immunotherapy in NMIBC both on its own and as a potential treatment in combination with RT It also discusses the development of immunotherapies in early bladder cancer disease states and in neoadjuvant and adjuvant perioperative settings for localized muscle invasive

complications and readmissions The Enhanced Recovery After Surgery ERAS protocol has been applied to RC showing decreased hospital stay without increased morbidity Objective To evaluate the specific causes of hospital readmissions in RC patients treated before and after adoption of an ERAS protocol at our institution Methods We retrospectively evaluated the outcome of 207 RC patients on ERAS protocol at the Stanford University Hospital from January 2012 to December 2014 We focused on early and late postoperative readmission rate and causes Results were compared with a consecutive series of 177 RC patients from January 2009 to December 2011 Results In the time period a total of 56 patients were readmitted 41 within the first 30 days after surgery 20 and 15 within the following 60 days 7 Fever often associated with dehydration was the most common reason for presentation to the hospital accounting for 57 of all readmissions At 90 days infection accounted for 53 of readmissions Of all the patients readmitted during the first 90 days after surgery 32 had positive urine cultures mostly caused by Enterococcus faecalis isolated in 18 56 Readmission rates did not increase since the introduction of the ERAS protocol with an incidence of 27 in the group versus 30 in the group Conclusions Despite accurate adherence to most recent perioperative antibiotic guidelines the incidence of readmissions after RC due to infection still remains significant View details for PubMedID 28149935 View details for PubMedCentralID PMC5271433 Prediction of Lymph Node Metastasis in Patients with

patients with muscle invasive bladder cancer misses up to 25 of lymph node metastasis These patients are at high risk for disease recurrence and improved clinical staging is critical to guide transcriptome expression profiles were generated in 199 patients who underwent radical cystectomy and extended pelvic lymph node dissection The cohort was divided randomly into a discovery set of 133 patients and a validation set of 66 In the discovery set features were identified and modeled in a KNN51 neighbor classifier 51 to predict pathological lymph node metastases Two previously described bladder cancer gene signatures including RF15 cancer recurrence signature and LN20 lymph node signature were also modeled in the discovery set for comparison The AUC and the OR were used to compare the performance of these the validation set KNN51 achieved an AUC of range to predict lymph node positive cases It significantly outperformed RF15 and LN20 which had an AUC of range and range respectively Only KNN51 showed significant odds of predicting LN metastasis with an OR of range for every 10 increase in score p RF15 and LN20 had a nonsignificant OR of range and range new KNN51 signature was superior to previously described gene signatures for predicting lymph node metastasis If validated prospectively in transurethral resection of bladder tumor samples KNN51 could be used

partial nephrectomy from 2002 to 2014 in the Veterans Health Administration We examined associations among patient age sex race or ethnicity multimorbidity baseline kidney function tumor characteristics and receipt of partial nephrectomy We estimated the odds of receiving a partial nephrectomy and assessed interactions between covariates and the year of surgery to explore whether patient factors associated with partial nephrectomy changed over our cohort of patients 4508 received a partial nephrectomy Use of partial nephrectomy increased from 17 in 2002 to 32 in 2008 and to 38 in 2014 Patient race or ethnicity age tumor stage and year of surgery were independently associated with receipt of partial nephrectomy Black veterans had significantly increased odds of receipt of partial nephrectomy whereas older patients had significantly reduced odds Partial nephrectomy utilization increased for all groups over time but older patients and patients with worse baseline kidney function showed the least increase in odds of partial the utilization of partial nephrectomy increased for all groups the greatest increase occurred in the youngest patients and those with the highest baseline kidney function These trends warrant further investigation to ensure that patients at the highest risk of impaired kidney function are considered for partial nephrectomy whenever possible

trial to determine whether the neobladder that included an antireflux mechanism was superior to the Studer pouch in patients with bladder cancer undergoing radical single center randomized controlled trial recruited patients with clinically nonmetastatic bladder cancer scheduled to undergo radical cystectomy with neobladder Eligible patients were randomly assigned to undergo or Studer ileal orthotopic neobladder Treatment assignment was not masked The primary end point was change in renal function from baseline to 3 years The Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration equation was used to calculate the estimated glomerular filtration February 2002 and November 2009 237 patients were randomly assigned to ileal orthotopic neobladder and 247 to Studer ileal orthotopic neobladder Baseline characteristics did not differ between the groups Between baseline and 3 years the estimated glomerular filtration rate decreased by m 2 in the Studer group and m 2 in the group Multivariable analysis showed that type of ileal orthotopic neobladder was not independently associated with renal function However baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate age and urinary tract obstruction were independently associated with decline in renal function Cumulative risk of urinary tract infection and overall late complications were not different between the groups but the was associated with an increased risk of secondary diversion related ileal orthotopic neobladder with an antireflux mechanism did not prevent a moderate reduction in renal function observed at 3 years compared to the Studer pouch but did result in an increase in diversion related secondary surgical procedures View details for DOI View details for PubMedID 25823791 Best Practices in Radical Cystectomy and Urinary

Extracellular cues play critical roles in the establishment of the epigenome during development and may also contribute to epigenetic perturbations found in disease states The direct role of the local tissue environment on the human epigenome however remains unclear due to limitations in studies of human subjects Here we use an isogenic human ileal neobladder surgical model and compare global DNA methylation levels of intestinal epithelial cells and construction using the Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip Our study is the first to quantify the effect of environmental cues on the human epigenome and show that the local tissue environment directly modulates DNA methylation patterns in normal differentiated cells in vivo In the neobladder the intestinal epithelial cells lose their epigenetic landscape in a manner following the tissue exposure to a bladder environment We find that de novo methylation of many enhancers occurs at the rate of per month P Pearson while demethylation of primarily transcribed regions occurs at the rate of per month P Pearson The dynamic resetting of the DNA methylome in the neobladder not only implicates local environmental cues in the shaping and maintenance of the epigenome but also illustrates an unexpected between the epigenome and the cellular environment View details for DOI View details for Web of Science ID 000334055600002 View details

histologically as either seminomas or germ cell tumors These subtypes differ by age at diagnosis and clinical course but little is known about etiological distinctions To test the hypothesis that histological subtypes have distinct sets of unrecognized etiological factors we used a recently described approach estimating the association between histological types of first and second tumors of men with 2 primary TGCTs The study population of 488 men each with 2 primary TGCTs was ascertained through cancer registries in the United States between 1972 and 2006 Univariate logistic regression analysis revealed that the histology of second primary TGCTs was associated with the histology of first TGCTs odds ratio 95 confidence interval however the association did not persist in analyses adjusted for age at diagnosis of first TGCT odds ratio 95 confidence interval These results would be expected if the subtypes share etiology but experience different rates of progression to diagnosis or if the histological fate of TGCTs is influenced by processes Men with 2 primary TGCTs provide novel opportunities to learn whether histological subtypes are likely to share etiology so results may

orthotopic bladder substitution daytime and nocturnal continence is achieved in and respectively Continence is inferior in elderly patients with orthotopic reconstruction Urinary retention remains significant in female patients ranging from 7 to 50 and subsequent UD have been assessed as the most difficult surgical procedure in urology Significant disparity on how the surgical complications were reported makes it impossible to compare postoperative morbidity results Complications rates overall following RC and UD are significant and when strict reporting criteria are incorporated they are much higher than previously published Fortunately most complications are minor Clavien grade 1 or 2 Complications can occur up to 20 yr after surgery emphasizing the need for lifelong monitoring

from retrospective studies that radical cystectomy with extended pelvic lymph node dissection provides better staging and outcomes than limited lymph node dissection However the optimal limits of extended lymph node dissection remain unclear We compared oncological outcomes at 2 cystectomy centers where 2 different extended lymph node dissection templates are practiced to determine whether removing lymphatic tissue up to the inferior mesenteric artery confers an additional survival undergoing radical cystectomy and extended lymph node dissection with curative intent from 1985 to 2005 were included in analysis if they met certain criteria including clinically organ confined urothelial bladder carcinoma cN0M0 pathological stage negative surgical margins and no neoadjuvant therapy Survival and recurrence data were data and pathological subgroup distribution pT2 and pT3 were similar in the 554 University of Southern California and 405 University of Bern patients University of Southern California patients had higher median number of lymph nodes removed than University of Bern patients 38 vs 22 p and a higher incidence of lymph node metastasis 35 vs 28 p However the University of Southern California and University of Bern groups had similar survival for 57 vs 67 and 32 vs 34 disease p and respectively The overall recurrence rate was equal at the 2 institutions 38 extended lymph node dissection up to the third of the common iliac vessels appears to provide survival and recurrence outcomes similar to those of a super extended template up to the inferior mesenteric artery Complete skeletonization in the extended lymph node dissection template is more important than nodal yield This does not exclude the possibility that certain patient subgroups with

challenging and morbid procedure We report early complication rates in patients undergoing cystectomy and urinary diversion after high dose pelvic 1983 to 2008 patients underwent cystectomy with urinary diversion at a single institution Of these patients 148 received 60 Gy or greater pelvic radiation therapy before surgery Patient medical records were retrospectively reviewed and any complication within 90 days of surgery was graded using the patient age was 74 years with a median American Society of Anesthesiologists score of 3 Patients received a median of 70 Gy pelvic radiation therapy a median of years before surgery Urinary diversions performed were ileal conduit in 65 patients continent cutaneous pouch in 35 and orthotopic neobladder in 48 A total of 335 early complications were identified The highest grade complication was 0 in 23 of the patients grade 1 in grade 2 in grade 3 in grade 4 in and grade 5 in Age older than 65 years and American Society of Anesthesiologists score were statistically significant predictors of postoperative complications and respectively The type of urinary diversion did not significantly affect the grade distribution or number of early complications per patient and respectively early complication rate using a standardized reporting system in patients undergoing radical cystectomy after radiation therapy is higher

Abstract Radical cystectomy with pelvic lymph node dissection PLND is the preferred treatment for invasive bladder cancer It not only results in the best term survival rates but also provides the most accurate disease staging and most effective local symptom control Recent investigations have demonstrated a clinical benefit to performance of an extended PLND including all lymphatic tissue to the level of the aortic bifurcation This review will summarize recent findings regarding the clinical benefits of radical cystectomy with extended lymphadenectomy and will also examine the latest surgical techniques for optimizing the performance of this technically demanding studies have demonstrated increased survival and overall survival rates in patients undergoing radical cystectomy with extended PLND even in cases of pathologically lymph node negative disease The growing use of minimally invasive techniques has prompted interest in robotic radical cystectomy and extended PLND and recent reports have demonstrated the feasibility of this technique The standardization of extended PLND templates has also been a focus of contemporary research strongly suggests that all patients undergoing radical cystectomy for bladder cancer should undergo concomitant extended PLND Randomized trials are still needed to confirm the benefits of extended over PLND and to clarify which patients may receive the greatest benefit from this procedure View details for DOI View details for Web of Science ID 000280552100013 View details for PubMedID 20657290 Soft Tissue Surgical Margin Status is a

Orthotopic neobladder reconstruction has become a standard form of urinary diversion in many centers for patients undergoing radical cystectomy for bladder cancer There is still controversy about the best technique for construction of the neobladder and especially whether it is necessary to include an antireflux designed a prospective randomized clinical trial comparing two forms of ileal neobladder the Studer pouch and the The latter includes an extraserosal tunneled afferent limb which prevents reflux from the pouch to the kidneys The primary endpoint of the study is renal function and anatomy at 3 years following surgery with secondary endpoints including early and late postoperative complications renal infections and need for secondary date we have randomized 462 patients over approximately 6 years with a planned full enrollment of 550 patients Ten percent of patients have been withdrawn because they did not undergo the planned orthotopic diversion due to a positive urethral margin on frozen section We expect approximately 70 of patients to be alive and available for at 3 years which will give us ample power to detect clinically meaningful differences in the outcome of these two trial has been feasible and randomization has been acceptable to most patients of the patients on this trial should be able to definitively answer the question of the importance

To evaluate the role of initial cystectomy in the management of T1 bladder selected review of the literature was performed to evaluate outcomes with intravesical therapy initial cystectomy in this patient population with a focus on identifying risk factors for failure of conservative studies in the literature fail to include central pathologic review and clinical staging and there are no randomized studies comparing outcomes with these two initial approaches Retrospective studies of patients with T1 tumors treated with initial intravesical therapy suggest that approximately 30 of patients will ultimately require cystectomy and 30 will die of their disease with or without cystectomy The risk of progression continues for the life of the patient and late recurrence and progression is common Initial clinical and pathologic factors can be identified that predict a high risk of progression and are reasonable indicators for initial cystectomy can provide a very high

invasive bladder cancer UROLOGIC AND ORIGINAL INVESTIGATIONS Skinner Stein Skinner 2007 25 1 Abstract Radical cystectomy is the gold standard for treatment of localized invasive bladder cancer in the United States In recent years there has been increasing focus on the importance of surgical technique as a factor that may influence the clinical and oncologic outcome of the operation beyond the classically recognized patient and factors There is still insufficient evidence to support the absolute standardization of the surgical technique or the establishment of firm benchmarks by which the individual surgeon can measure performance However there is considerable evidence suggesting that 3 aspects of surgical technique have an impact on outcome 1 Positive surgical margins nearly always result in ultimate cancer death The rate of positive margins varies with surgeon experience as well as with variables 2 The extent of lymphadenectomy has a significant impact on recurrence rates of the cancer regardless of whether the lymph nodes are pathologically positive or not 3 Higher volume surgeons have lower operative mortality and fewer positive surgical margins than surgeons Higher volume hospitals also have lower operative mortalities and shorter hospital stays for patients who have undergone radical cystectomy In this review the authors evaluate the evidence supporting each of these statements and suggest potential areas of standardization of surgical technique that could translate into improved patient outcomes View details for DOI View details for Web of Science ID

conduit diversion with continent cutaneous diversion orthotopic bladder substitution with respect to quality of life or similar concepts All studies were rated according to the International Consultation on Urological Diseases modification of Oxford Center for Medicine levels of literature on quality of life after radical cystectomy for bladder cancer was rather extensive but generally of questionable quality The main problems were flaws in the patient materials and methodologies used To our knowledge not a single randomized controlled study exists in the field Because only few articles achieved a level of evidence better than III the International Consultation on Urological Diseases rating system does not allow further differentiation among studies Most studies showed that overall quality of life after cystectomy remained good in most patients irrespective of urinary diversion studies are unable to prove that continent reconstruction after radical cystectomy is superior

body image dissatisfaction scale and quality of life questionnaire We compared of emotional distress global quality of life sexuality body image dissatisfaction urinary diversion problems and problems with social physical and functional activities in patients with advanced bladder cancer who underwent urinary diversion including an ileal conduit in 25 cutaneous Kock pouch in 93 and urethral Kock pouch in 103 Patients who had or had not received an inflatable penile prosthesis after cystectomy were also compared in regard to quality of life of type of urinary diversion the majority of patients reported good overall quality of life little emotional distress and few problems with social physical or functional activities Problems with urinary diversion and sexual functioning were identified as most common After controlling for age analysis of variance showed no significant differences among urinary diversion subgroups in any quality of life area However t tests controlling for age indicated that penile prosthesis placement was significantly associated with better sexual function and of life appears good in these survivors of advanced bladder cancer The type of urinary diversion does not

The effect of finasteride on the prostate gland in men with elevated serum antigen levels BRITISH JOURNAL OF CANCER Cote Skinner Salem Mertes Stanczyk Henderson Pike Ross 1998 78 3 Abstract Prostate cancer is a disease associated with androgens It has been hypothesized that reducing the conversion of testosterone T to dihydrotestosterone DHT in the prostate by the use of the drug finasteride a inhibitor will reduce the incidence of prostate cancer We investigated the chemopreventive potential of finasteride by evaluating its effect on the prostate gland of men with elevated serum antigen PSA men with elevated PSA and prostate sextant biopsies negative for cancer were randomized to receive finasteride 5 mg day 27 patients or no medication 25 patients for 12 months and were rebiopsied at 12 months The biopsies were evaluated for the presence of cancer the proportion of glandular and hyperplastic tissue and the presence of prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia PIN Epithelial proliferation was assessed in the prestudy and biopsies by immunohistochemistry using antibody to proliferating cell nuclear antigen PCNA Serum blood samples were drawn at baseline and after 1 3 6 and 12 months of study In the control group serum levels of PSA and T were unchanged throughout the 12 months In the finasteride group PSA decreased 48 P DHT decreased 67 P and T increased 21 P Histological evaluation of prestudy and biopsy specimens revealed that the finasteride group had a 30 reduction in the percentage of hyperplastic epithelial tissue P although this decrease was not statistically significantly different between the finasteride and control groups P In patients with PIN on prestudy biopsy no change occurred in the PIN lesions with finasteride treatment Finasteride also had no effect on the proliferation index of prostatic epithelial cells Of the 27 patients treated with finasteride eight 30 had adenocarcinoma of the prostate detected on the biopsy compared with one 4 of the control patients P In the treatment group six cancers occurred in the eight patients with PIN on the prestudy biopsy in the observation group no cancers were detected in the five patients with PIN on the prestudy biopsy P Two cancers occurred in the 19 men in the treatment group with no evidence of PIN on the prestudy biopsy compared with one cancer in the 20 men in the observation group with no evidence of PIN on the prestudy biopsy P This study using a novel model for evaluating efficacy of chemopreventive or therapeutic agents in men at high risk of prostate cancer provides

than 70 years Patients age 80 years or older had a similar early complication rate of 29 Late postoperative complications occurred in of patients age 70 years or older compared with of patients younger than 70 years There was no significant difference between the two groups with regard to pathologic stage or length of hospital stay The and overall survival rates for patients age 70 years or older were 60 and 53 respectively compared with 68 and 63 respectively for patients younger than 70 years There was no statistical difference between the groups when rates of disease recurrence were

Perez Meyerowitz Lieskovsky Skinner Reynolds Skinner 1997 50 5 Abstract It is well established that prostate cancer patients undergoing radical prostatectomy may experience disruptive side effects most notably urinary incontinence and erectile dysfunction The purpose of this study is to compare relevant outcomes between patients awaiting radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer and patients who already underwent the surgery taking into account type of prostatectomy and use of erectile compared of global quality of life sexuality urinary continence and physical capabilities in 86 patients 89 patients 74 prostatectomy patients who used erectile aids and a comparison group of 45 patients awaiting radical of type of surgery use of erectile aid or preoperative status most patients reported good quality of life The best outcomes in sexuality were reported by patients who used erectile aids who appeared similar in sexuality to patients awaiting surgery When differences were detected standard prostatectomy patients who did not use erectile aids scored worse in most areas of sexuality than patients who did not use erectile aids There were no differences in frequency of urinary leakage among the three surgery most patients reported problems in sexual and urinary function global quality of life does not appear to be compromised following radical prostatectomy Findings suggest that postsurgical sexuality differs depending on type of prostatectomy and use of erectile aids while urinary function is similar across surgery groups We conclude that erectile aids should be offered routinely to patients who are ineligible for surgery or experience erectile difficulties following the procedure View details for Web of Science ID A1997YG34600017 View details for PubMedID 9372885 Orthotopic lower urinary tract reconstruction in women using the kock ileal neobladder Updated experience in 34 patients JOURNAL OF UROLOGY Stein Grossfeld Freeman J Esrig Ginsberg Cote Skinner Boyd Lieskovsky Skinner 1997 158 2 Abstract Orthotopic lower urinary tract reconstruction has revolutionized urinary diversion following cystectomy Initially performed solely in male patients orthotopic diversion has now become a viable option in women Currently the orthotopic neobladder is the diversion of choice for women requiring lower urinary tract reconstruction at our institution We evaluate and update our clinical and functional experience with orthotopic reconstruction in female June 1990 34 women 31 to 86 years old median age 67 have undergone orthotopic lower urinary tract reconstruction following cystectomy Indications for cystectomy included transitional cell carcinoma in 29 patients urachal adenocarcinoma in 1 mesenchymal tumor of endometrial origin in 1 cervical carcinoma in 1 and a fibrotic radiated bladder in 1 In addition 1 woman underwent undiversion to the native urethra following a previous simple cystectomy and cutaneous diversion for eosinophilic cystitis Data were analyzed according to postoperative early and late complications survival tumor recurrence pathological evaluation of the cystectomy specimen continence status voiding pattern and patient satisfaction The median followup in this group of patients was 30 months range 17 to 70 were no perioperative deaths and 4 early 11 and 3 9 late complications Four patients died none with a urethral recurrence including 3 of metastatic bladder cancer and 1 of unrelated causes In another patient with an extensive mesenchymal tumor of the uterus a sigmoid tumor recurred requiring conversion of the orthotopic reservoir to a cutaneous diversion All of the remaining 29 patients are alive without evidence of disease Intraoperative frozen section of the distal surgical margin proximal urethra accurately evaluated confirmed by permanent section the proximal urethra prospectively for tumor in all 29 specimens removed for transitional cell carcinoma including 28 specimens 97 without evidence of tumor and 1 specimen with carcinoma in situ Complete daytime and nighttime continence was reported by 29 88 and 27 82 of 33 evaluable patients respectively A total of 28 patients 85 void to completion while 5 15 require some form of intermittent catheterization to empty the neobladder Patient satisfaction is excellent clinical and functional results demonstrated with further followup confirm our initial experience with orthotopic diversion in women Careful selection of appropriate female candidates for orthotopic diversion is critical and includes preoperative evaluation of the bladder neck and intraoperative frozen section analysis of the distal cystectomy margin Furthermore close monitoring of the retained urethra is mandatory in all women undergoing orthotopic diversion We believe that the orthotopic neobladder is the urinary diversion of choice in women following cystectomy View details for Web of Science ID A1997XL14300019 View details for PubMedID

Lieskovsky Boyd Cote Skinner 1996 156 3 Abstract We investigated the effect on survival of transitional cell carcinoma of the prostatic urethra ducts and stroma and determined the difference between prostatic stromal involvement occurring via direct extension through the bladder wall versus stromal invasion arising August 1971 and December 1989 489 men underwent radical cystoprostatectomy for transitional cell carcinoma including 143 identified with prostate involvement by transitional cell carcinoma in the cystectomy specimen Patients were separated into 2 groups in whom the primary bladder tumor extended full thickness through the bladder wall to invade the prostate classified as P4a and in whom prostate involvement arose from within the prostatic and overall survival rates were 25 and 21 respectively in group 1 versus 64 and 55 respectively in group 2 In the 124 patients in group 2 survival rates were similar for those with prostatic urethral tumors or carcinoma in situ and ductal tumors no stromal invasion overall survival rates without and with stromal invasion were 71 and 36 respectively p Transitional cell carcinoma of the prostatic urethra or ducts does not alter survival predicted by primary bladder stage alone Prostatic stromal invasion arising intraurethrally significantly decreases survival which varies based on primary bladder stage in stage P1 in stages and in stage P3b p P1 bladder tumors with prostatic stromal invasion arising intraurethrally had a significantly higher survival rate than P4a tumors versus 21 p P3b bladder tumors with stromal invasion had a survival rate similar to that of P4a tumors p urethral or ductal transitional cell carcinoma does not alter survival determined by primary bladder stage alone and it should not be classified as P4a Prostatic stromal involvement arising intraurethrally significantly decreases survival predicted by primary bladder stage alone P1 bladder tumors with prostatic stromal invasion arising intraurethrally have a significantly higher survival rate than P4a tumors and they should be separately classified as P1str Muscle invasive bladder tumors with stromal invasion have a higher survival rate than P4a tumors no statistical significance and they should be designated separately that is P2str P3b bladder tumors with prostatic stromal invasion arising intraurethrally are

at our institution The intussuscepted afferent nipple valve of the Kock ileal reservoir is designed to prevent reflux and protect the upper urinary tract Problems associated specifically with the afferent antireflux valve have been few We defined and characterized all complications associated with the Kock pouch antireflux nipple November 1984 through July 1992 802 patients underwent construction of a continent Kock ileal reservoir All complications associated with the afferent antireflux valve in this group and their management were 79 of 802 patients had a total of 84 complications of the afferent antireflux valve including formation of stones on staples securing the afferent nipple valve in 42 cases stenosis of the afferent valve in 35 and prolapse of the valve in

from female patients undergoing cystectomy for primary bladder cancer were reviewed These pathological findings should provide a better understanding of tumor involvement at the bladder neck vesicourethral junction and urethra in women with transitional cell carcinoma of the specimens of 67 consecutive women undergoing surgery for biopsy proved transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder between July 1982 and July 1990 were pathologically evidence of tumor carcinoma in situ or gross carcinoma involving the urethra was present in 9 patients 13 Tumor was confined to the proximal and mid urethra and the distal urethra was not involved All patients with carcinoma involving the urethra had concomitant evidence of carcinoma involving the bladder neck A total of 17 patients 25 had tumor involvement of the bladder neck and those with an uninvolved bladder neck also had an uninvolved urethra The association between the presence of tumor in the bladder neck and urethra was highly significant p or Tumor involving the bladder neck and urethra tended to be more commonly associated with high grade and stage tumors and the fate of the retained urethra following cystectomy for bladder cancer in women is unknown these results show that women with transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder without evidence of tumor involving the bladder neck are at low risk for urethral

Abstract Multidisciplinary clinics integrate the expertise of several specialties to provide effective treatment to patients This exposure is especially relevant in the management of bladder cancer MIBC which requires critical input from urology radiation oncology and medical oncology among other supportive the present study we sought to catalog the different styles of multidisciplinary care models used in the management of MIBC and to identify barriers to their implementation We surveyed providers from academic and community practices regarding their currently implemented multidisciplinary care models available resources and perceived barriers using the Bladder Cancer Advocacy Network and the Genitourinary Medical Oncologists of Canada the 101 responding providers most practiced at academic institutions in the United States 61 or Canada 29 and only 7 were from community practices The most frequently used model was sequential visits on different days 57 followed by sequential 39 and concurrent 1 visit with all providers 22 models However most practitioners preferred a multidisciplinary clinic involving sequential 41 or concurrent 26 visits The lack of clinic space 58 funding 41 staff 40 and time 32 were the most common barriers to implementing a multidisciplinary surveyed practitioners at academic centers use some form of a multidisciplinary care model for patients with MIBC The major barriers to more integrated multidisciplinary clinics were limited time and resources rather than a lack of provider enthusiasm Future studies should incorporate patient preferences further evaluate practice patterns in community settings and assess their effects on patient outcomes View details for PubMedID 29289519 Editorial Comment JOURNAL OF UROLOGY

Sharma Skinner Sonpavde Taylor J Abraham Rosenberg 2017 5 68 Abstract The standard of care for most patients with bladder cancer NMIBC is immunotherapy with intravesical Bacillus BCG which activates the immune system to recognize and destroy malignant cells and has demonstrated durable clinical benefit Urologic guidelines and consensus reports have been developed and strengthened based on data on the timing dose and duration of therapy from randomized clinical trials as well as by critical evaluation of criteria for progression However these reports have not penetrated the community and many patients do not receive appropriate therapy Additionally several immune checkpoint inhibitors have recently been approved for treatment of metastatic disease The approval of immune checkpoint blockade for patients with or metastatic bladder cancer has led to considerations of expanded use for both advanced and potentially localized disease To address these issues and others surrounding the appropriate use of immunotherapy for the treatment of bladder cancer the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer SITC convened a Task Force of experts including physicians patient advocates and nurses to address issues related to patient selection toxicity management clinical endpoints as well as the combination and sequencing of therapies Following the standard approach established by the Society for other cancers a systematic literature review and analysis of data combined with consensus voting was used to generate guidelines Here we provide a consensus statement for the use of immunotherapy in

United States and is seen predominantly in men Most cases of this disease present as bladder cancer NMIBC with cancer recurrence or progression to cancer in more than 50 of patients after initial therapy NMIBC is an disease as indicated by the use of intravesical bacillus as treatment for more than 3 decades More recently immunotherapy has seen much progress in a variety of cancers including advanced and metastatic bladder cancer in which historical survival rates are approximately 15 The advent of checkpoint inhibitors especially those directed at programmed death 1 and its ligand has had a significant effect on the therapy of advanced urothelial cancer This had led to accelerated approval by the US Food and Drug Administration for atezolizumab and nivolumab in advanced urothelial cancer previously treated with chemotherapy In addition level 1 evidence supports the use of pembrolizumab over chemotherapy in the same setting Several other treatments with mechanisms of action are in development and hold great promise including monoclonal antibodies directed at other checkpoint molecules oncolytic virus therapy adoptive therapy combination immunotherapy and conjugates This review focuses on the recent development of checkpoint inhibitors in advanced and metastatic urothelial cancer and addresses their potential use in combination It also discusses a spectrum of novel

of standard urine cytology for detecting urothelial carcinoma of the bladder UCB is low attributable largely to its inability to process entire samples paucicellularity and presence of background performance and practical applicability of a novel portable microfiltration device for capture enumeration and characterisation of exfoliated tumour cells in urine and compare it with standard urine cytology for UCB total of 54 urine and bladder wash samples from patients undergoing surveillance for UCB were prospectively evaluated by standard and urine cytology comparison of quality and performance metrics and cost effectiveness was conducted for both samples were paucicellular by standard cytology no samples processed by microfilter cytology were paucicellular Standard cytology had more samples with background cells that limited evaluation p Microfilter cytology was more concordant than standard cytology with true UCB diagnosis Sensitivity specificity and accuracy were higher for microfilter cytology compared to standard cytology versus 40 respectively cells were amenable to downstream molecular analyses A 40 ml sample was processed in under 4 min by microfilter cytology compared to min by standard cytology Median microfilter cytology processing and costs were approximately 63 cheaper and 80 times lower than standard cytology microfiltration device represents a novel

responsiveness which might explain aspects of the heterogeneity of the natural history of prostate cancer for although ADT has been used to reduce prostate cancer there are controversial data on the effect of ADT on assessed retrospectively patients with prostate cancer who had RP some patients had received months of ADT at the discretion of their surgeons and patients from the same cohort who did not have ADT were used as controls Patients were sequentially selected from the database and their pathology slides were reviewed by a pathologist unaware of the initial presence of PIN assessed by an independent observer Fisher exact test was used to compare the proportions of patients who had residual PIN in the study and control groups Exact logistic regression was used to evaluate the duration of ADT on PIN patients initially diagnosed with PIN who had no ADT were identified and 28 with PIN who had ADT were also assessed All patients who had had no ADT had residual PIN whereas seven of 28 receiving ADT had no residual PIN The evaluation of ADT between responders and nonresponders showed a statistically significant association between PIN regression and the duration of ADT P However the response of PIN to ADT was not uniform as 16 of patients on ADT for 6 months had residual PIN suggesting variable sensitivity of PIN to results show that ADT causes PIN to regress and that there is heterogeneity in this effect with the duration of ADT We propose future prospective multicentre randomized trials in which the effect of ADT on PIN is characterized further View details for

acute myocardial infarction cerebrovascular accident arterial thrombosis or due to septic complications with resulting system failure followed by pulmonary embolism hepatic failure and hemorrhage Septic related mortality was most often associated with postoperative urine or bowel leak While most deaths occurred before hospital discharge 2 patients died at home due to a late pulmonary embolus

orthotopic lower urinary tract reconstruction in June 1990 and July 2002 101 female patients with primary transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder were treated with radical cystectomy and orthotopic ileal neobladder reconstruction Four patients 61 to 73 years old underwent pubovaginal slings autologous rectus fascia in 2 and dermal graft in 2 for stress urinary incontinence persisting 9 to 20 months following reconstruction with a Studer 2 or T pouch 2 ileal neobladder continence was excellent in 3 patients while 1 had mild stress incontinence All patients had high grade muscle invasive transitional cell carcinoma carcinoma in situ with negative urethral margins and 3 of the 4 had lymph node negative disease on pathological examination Two patients were treated with transurethral bulking material 4 to 5 months prior to the sling procedure without noticeable patients who underwent autologous pubovaginal slings had significant complications arising from dissection in the retropubic space including 1 fistula and 1 enterotomy resulting in an enterocutaneous fistula sepsis and subsequent death These 2 patients had persistent stress incontinence despite the sling procedures and they ultimately underwent conversion to continent cutaneous urinary diversions Two patients were treated with a dermal graft sling using infrapubic bone anchors through a transvaginal approach obviating the need to enter the pelvis These patients had uneventful postoperative courses and they are currently hypercontinent performing intermittent catheterization with complete daytime continence and only occasional nighttime leakage 3 and 9 months following sling sling procedures for incontinence following orthotopic neobladder reconstruction in women may be complicated due to extensive pelvic surgery Dissection in the retropubic space should be avoided because potentially fatal complications may occur Slings using infrapubic bone anchors may provide the best option in such patients in whom conservative management has failed because the pelvis need not be violated View details for DOI View details for Web of Science ID 000222115700053 View details for PubMedID 15201778

Abstract considerations were one of the main driving forces behind the development of continent urinary diversion However the field of formal study that allows us to document these aspects of treatment is still relatively young In the past decade a number of studies of cystectomy patients have been undertaken with somewhat mixed results Many of these studies have been limited by small patient numbers and the differences in the various treatment groups for example in age and comorbidities Most have shown that overall quality of life after cystectomy remains good for most patients with the expected problems with urinary diversion and sexual dysfunction However few differences between the diversion groups have been demonstrated suggesting that patients adapt to whatever is required of them One large study from Germany did find significant improvement in several aspects of quality of life in patients with continent diversion Patient education exploration of the pros and cons of the various alternatives and active patient participation in the treatment decisions seem to be key to postoperative satisfaction View details for PubMedID 11246735 Continent and orthotopic urinary diversion following radical cystectomy Should these reconstructive procedures now be considered standard of care Surgical oncology clinics of North America Boyd Skinner Lieskovsky Skinner 1995 4 2 Abstract Our extensive operative experience with various forms of the continent ileal reservoir in more than 1000 patients over the past 12 years has demonstrated clearly the extreme reliability and durability of this diversion system Reflux reliably can be prevented and the upper urinary tracts protected Patients can void or catheterize with confidence Orthotopic diversions should now be available to most patients both male and female Patients should be able to live a more normal life style with a positive self image We believe that because our modifications of the ileal reservoir systems have decreased the need for reoperation these forms of continent urinary diversion have emerged as optimal operations and even as the standard of care in cystectomy patients Ileal conduits should be reserved for candidates with life expectancy or for those patients not motivated for continent diversion The most vocal advocates of the procedures remain those continent diversion patients who have had urinary diversion by another method Patients still must be aware that complications can occur Appropriate patient motivation and a thorough understanding of the continent diversion technique and its potential problems continue to be essential prerequisites of the operation Although minor refinements to these systems will continue to be made we feel that continent diversion most often in the form of orthotopic reconstruction can be offered safely and wisely most to patients View details for PubMedID 7796286 XANTHOGRANULOMATOUS PYELONEPHRITIS CLINICAL FINDINGS AND SURGICAL

if they correlated with surgical CT scan was performed in 23 of the 27 patients Of these 23 patients 20 87 were diagnosed with XGP based on the CT findings CT accurately defined the extent of the perinephric inflammatory reaction identifying 8 patients with muscular extension 3 with splenic involvement 1 with extension into the colon and 5 with encasement of the great vessels In no case did CT underestimate the involvement of adjacent XGP is a rare disease a careful preoperative evaluation can suggest its diagnosis CT is particularly valuable in that it not only demonstrates characteristic

wall and invade the perivesical fat or adjacent organs is a critical prognostic determinant Nodal metastases are evident in approximately one half of patients with tumors pathologically staged as P3b or greater survival rates after radical cystectomy with or without preoperative irradiation for stage P3b tumors range from 17 to 46 survival is the exception when bladder cancer invades the pelvic sidewall or adjacent structures yet cystectomy can provide palliation and accurate staging and can be considered in the context of combination therapy Supravesical diversion can provide palliation when there is nodal disease above the bifurcation or pelvic fixation The optimal role of adjuvant chemotherapy in the treatment of regionally advanced bladder cancer is yet to be defined Tannock has delineated the many serious pitfalls inherent in interpreting nonrandomized trials of new therapies see also his article elsewhere in this issue Randomized trials are currently under way to determine if survival can be improved with adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy and the most efficacious timing of chemotherapy administration Clinicians should generally resist the tendency to treat all patients with these regimens until it is clear that we are truly improving the outcome of therapy and the quality of life for our patients View details for Web of Science ID A1992LA25700010 View
