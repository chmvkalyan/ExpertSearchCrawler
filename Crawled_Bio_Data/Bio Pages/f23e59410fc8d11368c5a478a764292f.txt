Curriculum Vitae PDF My Lab Website Current Research and Scholarly Interests My primary interest is in improving prostate cancer diagnosis and treatment through MRI and prostate biopsy In collaboration with radiologists at Stanford we are working to define the optimal role of MRI in prostate cancer We hope to improve cancer imaging to the point that some men with elevated PSA may safely avoid prostate biopsy For those who need biopsy we are evaluating novel fusion targeted biopsy a technique that greatly improves upon the conventional biopsy method More accurate prostate biopsy enables better decision making about treatment options such as deciding between active surveillance and beyond biopsy I am interested in the use of imaging to select patients who are candidates for prostate cancer focal therapy Focal therapy involves ablation of prostate cancers under image guidance without destruction or removal of the normal areas of the prostate and with less damage to important surrounding structures that are important for erectile function and urinary am also interested in developing novel molecular imaging techniques such as near infrared fluorescence imaging to improve surgery for prostate and kidney cancer Clinical Trials A Pilot Study of 68Ga PSMA 11 and 68Ga RM2 for Biopsy Guidance in Patients With Suspected Prostate Cancer Recruiting The objective of the

Soerensen Teslovich Sood Chen Fan Ghanouni Brooks Sonn A 2020 Abstract PURPOSE Magnetic resonance imaging MRI has great potential to improve prostate cancer diagnosis however subtle differences between cancer and confounding conditions render prostate MRI interpretation challenging The tissue collected from patients who undergo radical prostatectomy provides a unique opportunity to correlate histopathology images of the prostate with MRI to accurately map the extent of cancer from histopathology images onto MRI We seek to develop an platform to align MRI and histopathology images of resected prostates in patients who underwent radical prostatectomy to create accurate cancer labels on Here we introduce RAdiology Pathology Spatial Integration RAPSODI the first framework for the registration of radiology and pathology images RAPSODI relies on three steps First it creates a 3D reconstruction of the histopathology specimen as a digital representation of the tissue before gross sectioning Second RAPSODI registers corresponding histopathology and MRI slices Third the optimized transforms are applied to the cancer regions outlined on the histopathology images to project those labels onto the We tested RAPSODI in a phantom study where we simulated various conditions tissue shrinkage during fixation Our experiments showed that RAPSODI can reliably correct multiple artifacts We also evaluated RAPSODI in 157 patients from three institutions that underwent radical prostatectomy and have very different pathology processing and scanning RAPSODI was evaluated in 907 corresponding slices and achieved a Dice coefficient of for the prostate a Hausdorff distance of mm for the prostate boundary a urethra deviation of mm and a landmark deviation of mm between registered histopathology images and Our robust framework successfully mapped the extent of cancer from histopathology slices onto MRI providing labels from training machine learning methods to detect cancer on MRI View details for DOI View details for PubMedID 32564359 Imaging before prostatectomy correlation with surgical pathology and follow up Moradi Baratto Duan Hatami Davidzon Sonn Iagaru SOC

Sonn Kao Zhao Tibshirani Zare Brooks 2019 Abstract Clear cell renal cell carcinoma ccRCC is the most common and lethal subtype of kidney cancer Intraoperative frozen section IFS analysis is used to confirm the diagnosis during partial nephrectomy PN However surgical margin evaluation using IFS analysis is time consuming and unreliable leading to relatively low utilization In this study we demonstrated the use of desorption electrospray ionization mass spectrometry imaging as a molecular diagnostic and prognostic tool for ccRCC was conducted on 23 paired nephrectomy specimens of ccRCC An independent validation cohort of 17 pairs were analyzed provides molecular images of tissues with mass spectra representing small metabolites fatty acids and lipids These tissues were subjected to histopathologic evaluation A set of metabolites that distinguish ccRCC from normal kidney were identified by performing least absolute shrinkage and selection operator Lasso and Lasso analysis Lasso analysis with cross validation selected 57 peaks from over metabolic features across pixels obtained using of ccRCC and normal tissues Baseline Lasso of metabolites predicted the class of each tissue to be normal or cancerous tissue with an accuracy of 94 and 76 respectively Combining the baseline Lasso with the ratio of glucose to arachidonic acid could potentially reduce scan time and improve accuracy to identify normal 82 and ccRCC 88 tissue allows rapid detection of metabolites associated with normal and ccRCC with high accuracy As this technology advances it could be used for rapid

technologies that simultaneously provide anatomical functional and molecular information are emerging as an attractive choice for disease screening and management Since the 1980s transrectal ultrasound TRUS has been routinely used to visualize prostatic anatomy and guide needle biopsy despite limited specificity Photoacoustic imaging PAI provides functional and molecular information at ultrasonic resolution based on optical absorption Combining the strengths of TRUS and PAI approaches we report the development and translation of an integrated TRUS and photoacoustic TRUSPA device TRUSPA uses a miniaturized capacitive micromachined ultrasonic transducer array for simultaneous imaging of anatomical and molecular optical contrasts intrinsic hemoglobin extrinsic intravenous indocyanine green ICG of the human prostate Hemoglobin absorption mapped vascularity of the prostate and surroundings whereas ICG absorption enhanced the intraprostatic photoacoustic contrast Future

imaging reporting and data system version 2 v2 relegates dynamic contrast enhanced DCE imaging to a minor role We sought to determine how often DCE is used in v2 AND METHODS We retrospectively reviewed data from 388 patients who underwent prostate magnetic resonance imaging and subsequent biopsy from January 2016 through December 2017 In accordance with v2 DCE was deemed necessary if a lesion had a imaging score of 3 or if a lesion had a T2 score of 3 and imaging experienced technical failure Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis assessed the accuracy of antigen density PSAD at different threshold values for differentiating lesions that would be equivocal with noncontrast technique Accuracy of PSAD was compared to DCE using McNemar lesions in 62 patients 16 required DCE for scoring Biopsy of 10 14 of these lesions showed clinically significant cancer Gleason score In the subgroup of patients with equivocal lesions those with clinically significant cancer had significantly higher PSADs than those with clinically insignificant lesions means of and respectively In this subgroup there was no statistical difference in accuracy in determining clinically significant cancer between a PSAD threshold value of and DCE Only 16 of our patients needed DCE to generate the version 2 score raising the possibility of limiting the initial screening prostate MRI

Leppert Brooks Ahmadi Sonn A 2019 Abstract The PRECISION trial provides level 1 evidence supporting prebiopsy multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging mpMRI followed by targeted biopsy only when mpMRI is abnormal 1 This approach reduced of cancer while increasing detection of clinically significant cancer CSC Still important questions remain regarding the reproducibility of these findings outside of a clinical trial and quantifying missed CSC diagnoses using this approach To address these issues we retrospectively applied the PRECISION strategy in men who each underwent prebiopsy mpMRI followed by systematic and targeted imaging and pathology data were prospectively collected from 358 biopsy naïve men and 202 men with previous negative biopsies To apply the PRECISION approach a retrospective analysis was done comparing the cancer yield from 2 diagnostic strategies 1 mpMRI followed by targeted biopsy alone for men with Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System 3 lesions and 2 systematic biopsy alone for all men Primary outcomes were biopsies avoided and the proportion of CSC cancer Grade Group and Grade Group 1 biopsy naïve patients the mpMRI diagnostic strategy would have avoided 19 of biopsies while detecting more CSC and 12 less P Thirteen percent 9 of men with normal mpMRI had CSC on systematic biopsy For previous negative biopsy patients the mpMRI diagnostic strategy avoided 21 of biopsies while detecting more CSC and 13 less P Seven percent 3 of men with normal mpMRI had CSC on systematic results provide external validation of the PRECISION finding that mpMRI followed by targeted biopsy of suspicious lesions reduces biopsies and of cancer Unlike PRECISION we did not find increased diagnosis of CSC This was true in both biopsy naïve and previously negative biopsy cohorts We have incorporated this information into shared decision making which has led some men to choose to avoid biopsy However we continue to recommend targeted and systematic

prostatectomy in patients with or cancer Materials and Methods men who underwent conventional imaging as clinically indicated and who were scheduled for radical prostatectomy with pelvic lymph node dissection were recruited for this study A mean dose of mCi MBq of was administered images were acquired starting minutes after injection by using a GE SIGNA imaging unit followed by an additional pelvic imaging acquisition at minutes after injection imaging findings were compared with findings at multiparametric MR imaging including imaging imaging and dynamic contrast imaging and were correlated with results of final pathologic examination and pelvic nodal dissection to yield sensitivity and specificity metabolic parameters eg maximum standardized uptake value SUVmax were compared by using a paired t test and were correlated with clinical and histopathologic variables including antigen level Gleason score and tumor volume Results Prostate cancer was seen at PET in all 33 patients whereas multiparametric MR imaging depicted Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System 4 or 5 lesions in 26 patients and 3 lesions in four patients Focal uptake was seen in the pelvic lymph nodes in five patients Pathologic examination confirmed prostate cancer in all patients as well as nodal metastasis in three All patients with normal pelvic nodes in imaging had no metastases at pathologic examination The accumulation of increased at later acquisition times with higher mean SUVmax vs P One additional prostate cancer was identified only at delayed imaging Conclusion This study found that PET can be used to identify prostate cancer while MR imaging provides detailed anatomic guidance Hence imaging provides valuable diagnostic information and may inform the need for and

overall patient survival when using PSA values from either the VA Central Cancer Registry versus the gold standard electronic health record laboratory file There was limited agreement between cohorts defined using either the cancer registry PSA values versus the laboratory file of the electronic health record The least agreement was seen in patients with PSA values 58 and greatest among patients with PSA values between and 89 In each cohort patients assigned to a cohort based only on the cancer registry PSA value had significantly different overall survival when compared with patients assigned based on both the registry and laboratory file PSA Cohorts based exclusively on cancer registry PSA values may have high rates of misclassification that can introduce concerning differences

imaging of small metabolites and lipids PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA Banerjee Zare Tibshirani Kunder Nolley Fan Brooks Sonn A 2017 114 13 Abstract Accurate identification of prostate cancer in frozen sections at the time of surgery can be challenging limiting the surgeon ability to best determine resection margins during prostatectomy We performed desorption electrospray ionization mass spectrometry imaging on 54 banked human cancerous and normal prostate tissue specimens to investigate the spatial distribution of a wide variety of small metabolites carbohydrates and lipids In contrast to several previous studies our method included Krebs cycle intermediates 200 which we found to be highly informative in distinguishing cancer from benign tissue Malignant prostate cells showed marked metabolic derangements compared with their benign counterparts Using the Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator Lasso we analyzed all metabolites from the data and identified parsimonious sets of metabolic profiles for distinguishing between cancer and normal tissue In an independent set of samples we could use these models to classify prostate cancer from benign specimens with nearly 90 accuracy per patient Based on previous work in prostate cancer showing that glucose levels are high while citrate is low we found that measurement of the ion signal ratio accurately predicted cancer when this ratio exceeds and normal prostate when the ratio is less than After brief tissue preparation the ratio can be recorded on a tissue sample in 1 min or less which is in sharp contrast to the 20 min or more required by histopathological examination of frozen tissue specimens View details for DOI View details for Web of

by conventional and IRE protocols by using 2 probe configurations a single probe with two collinear electrodes 2EP or a single electrode configured with a grounding pad The new electrode configuration was evaluated in ex vivo liver configuration produced more spherical ablation volumes than the 2EP configuration in computed simulations and tissue models In prostate tissue computed simulations predicted ablation volumes at V of cm 3 for the configurations compared with cm 3 for the 2EP configuration in liver tissue the predicted ablation volumes were times larger than those in the prostate Vegetable model studies verify that the configuration produces larger and more spherical ablations than those produced by the 2EP IRE treatment of ex vivo liver with the configuration created a ablation modeling showed that configuration for IRE procedures yields ablations that are larger than the 2EP configuration creating substantial ablation zones with a single electrode placement When

A Verma Choyke Eberhardt Eggener Gaitonde Haider Margolis Marks Pinto Sonn Taneja 2016 Abstract After an initial negative biopsy there is an ongoing need for strategies to improve patient selection for repeat biopsy as well as the diagnostic yield from repeat a collaborative initiative of the AUA American Urological Association and SAR Society of Abdominal Radiology Prostate Cancer Disease Focused Panel an expert panel of urologists and radiologists conducted a literature review and formed consensus statements regarding the role of prostate magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance imaging targeted biopsy in patients with a negative biopsy which are summarized in this panel recognizes that many options exist for men with a previously negative biopsy If a biopsy is recommended prostate magnetic resonance imaging and subsequent magnetic resonance imaging targeted cores appear to facilitate the detection of clinically significant disease over standardized repeat biopsy Thus when high quality prostate magnetic resonance imaging is available it should be strongly considered for any patient with a prior negative biopsy who has persistent clinical suspicion for prostate cancer and who is under evaluation for a possible repeat biopsy The decision of whether to perform magnetic resonance imaging in this setting must also take into account the results of any other biomarkers and the cost of the examination as well as the availability of high quality prostate magnetic resonance imaging interpretation If magnetic resonance imaging is done it should be performed interpreted and reported in accordance with version 2 v2 guidelines Experience of the reporting radiologist and biopsy operator are required to achieve optimal results and practices integrating prostate magnetic resonance imaging into patient care are advised to implement quality assurance programs to monitor targeted biopsy receiving a assessment category of 3 to 5 warrant repeat biopsy with image guided targeting While transrectal ultrasound guided magnetic resonance imaging fusion or magnetic resonance imaging targeting may be valuable for more reliable targeting especially for lesions that are small or in difficult locations in the absence of such targeting technologies cognitive visual targeting remains a reasonable approach in skilled hands At least 2 targeted cores should be obtained from each magnetic resonance imaging defined target Given the number of studies showing a proportion of missed clinically significant cancers by magnetic resonance imaging targeted cores a case specific decision must be made whether to also perform concurrent systematic sampling However performing solely targeted biopsy should only be considered once quality assurance efforts have validated the performance of prostate magnetic resonance imaging interpretations with results consistent with the published literature In patients with negative or low suspicion magnetic resonance imaging assessment category of 1 or 2 respectively other ancillary markers ie PSA PSAD PSAV PCA3 PHI 4K may be of value in identifying patients warranting repeat systematic biopsy although further data are needed on this topic If a repeat biopsy is deferred on the basis of magnetic resonance imaging findings then continued clinical and laboratory followup is advised and

cooperated in a comprehensive search of the peer reviewed English medical literature on Gleason 6 prostate cancer specifically focusing on the history of the Gleason scoring system histological features clinical characteristics practice patterns and Gleason scoring system was devised in the early 1960s widely adopted by 1987 and revised in 2005 with a more restrictive definition of Gleason 6 disease There is near consensus that Gleason 6 meets pathological definitions of cancer but controversy about whether it meets commonly accepted molecular and genetic criteria of cancer Multiple clinical series suggest that the metastatic potential of contemporary Gleason 6 disease is negligible but not zero Population based studies in the suggest that more than 90 of men newly diagnosed with prostate cancer undergo treatment and are exposed to the risk of morbidity for a cancer unlikely to cause symptoms or decrease life expectancy Efforts have been proposed to minimize the number of men diagnosed with or treated for Gleason 6 prostate cancer These include modifications to prostate specific antigen based screening strategies such as targeting high risk populations decreasing the frequency of screening recommending screening cessation incorporating remaining life expectancy estimates using shared decision making and novel biomarkers and eliminating prostate specific antigen screening entirely Large nonrandomized and randomized studies have shown that active surveillance is an effective management strategy for men with Gleason 6 disease Active surveillance dramatically reduces the number of men undergoing treatment without apparent compromise of cancer related definition and clinical relevance of Gleason 6 prostate cancer have changed substantially since its introduction nearly 50 years ago A high proportion of screen detected cancers are Gleason 6 and the metastatic potential is negligible Dramatically reducing the diagnosis and treatment of Gleason 6

analysis Chromosome 8q status was correlated with clinicopathological variables and its impact on DSS was of 8q occurred in 28 tumors Gain of 8q was associated with a higher risk of regional lymph node vs P and distant metastases vs P and greater tumor sizes P Patients with gain of 8q had a increased risk of death from CCRCC P In multivariable analysis gain of 8q was identified as an independent prognostic factor hazard ratio P The concordance index of a multivariable base model increased significantly following inclusion of 8q gain P of chromosome 8q occurs in a subset of CCRCCs and is associated with an increased risk of metastases and death from CCRCC Because the is among the list of candidate genes located on 8q our data suggest that these tumors may have unique pathways activated which are associated with an aggressive tumor phenotype If confirmed defining tumors with gain of 8q may assist in identifying patients who would benefit for specific inhibitors or agents that target the protein kinase pathway View details for DOI View details for PubMedID 22605478 VALUE OF TARGETED BIOPSY IN DETECTING PROSTATE CANCER USING AN FUSION DEVICE Annual Meeting of the AUA

update Reviews in urology Logan Rampersaud Sonn Chamie Belldegrun Pantuck Slamon Kabbinavar 2012 14 Abstract An understanding of metastatic renal cell carcinoma mRCC is important so that practitioners can make informed decisions with patients to optimize not only quantity of life but quality of life as well Therefore this review focuses on the biology of mRCC as it relates to targets for therapy as well as on the small molecules rationally designed with these targets in mind In addition anticipated emerging therapies are highlighted including the new tyrosine kinase inhibitors axitinib and tivozanib as well as new therapies such as dendritic vaccines and antibodies We also briefly review recent reports from the emerging field of predicting drug response based on molecular markers And finally management of metastatic cell RCC histologies are discussed focusing on available evidence to direct decision making when assessing therapeutic options View details for PubMedID 23526579 Dynamic Microscopy of the Urinary Tract Using Confocal Laser Endomicroscopy UROLOGY Wu Liu Adams Sonn Mach Pan Beck Jensen Liao 2011 78 1 Abstract To develop the diagnostic criteria for benign and neoplastic conditions of the urinary tract using confocal laser endomicroscopy pCLE a new technology for dynamic in vivo imaging with resolution The suggested diagnostic criteria will formulate a guide for pCLE image interpretation in scheduled for transurethral resection of bladder tumor TURBT or nephrectomy were recruited After cystoscopy WLC fluorescein was administered as contrast Different areas of the urinary tract were imaged with pCLE via direct contact between the confocal probe and the area of interest Confocal images were subsequently compared with standard hematoxylin and eosin images were collected from 66 participants including 2 patients who underwent nephrectomy We identified key features associated with different anatomic landmarks of the urinary tract including the kidney ureter bladder prostate and urethra In vivo pCLE of the bladder demonstrated distinct differences between normal mucosa and neoplastic tissue Using mosaicing a post hoc algorithm individual image frames were juxtaposed to form views to better evaluate tissue contrast to standard pathologic analysis of fixed tissue with hematoxylin and eosin pCLE provides real time microscopy of the urinary tract to enable dynamic interrogation of benign and neoplastic tissues in vivo The diagnostic criteria developed in this study will facilitate adaptation of pCLE for use in conjunction with WLC to expedite diagnosis of urinary tract pathology particularly bladder cancer View details for DOI View details for Web of Science ID 000292080300062 View details for PubMedID 21601243 View

Mach Shih Gau Wong Liao 2010 26 2 Abstract Urine is the most abundant and easily accessible of all body fluids and provides an ideal route for diagnosis of human diseases particularly of the urinary tract Electrochemical biosensors are well suited for urinary diagnostics due to their excellent sensitivity and ability to detect a wide variety of target molecules including nucleic acids and protein biomarkers We report the development of an electrochemical immunosensor for direct detection of the urinary tract infection UTI biomarker lactoferrin from infected clinical samples An electrochemical biosensor array with alkanethiolate monolayer SAM was used Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy was used to characterize the mixed SAM consisted of acid and A sandwich amperometric immunoassay was developed for detection of lactoferrin from urine with a detection limit of 145 We validated lactoferrin as a biomarker of pyuria presence of white blood cells in urine an important hallmark of UTI in 111 urine samples Finally we demonstrated multiplex detection of urinary pathogens and lactoferrin through simultaneous detection of bacterial nucleic acid 16S rRNA and host immune response protein lactoferrin on a single sensor array Our results represent first integrated sensor platform capable of quantitative pathogen identification and measurement of host immune response potentially providing clinical diagnosis that is not only more expeditious but also more informative than the current standard View details for DOI View details for Web of Science ID 000283804400056 View details

life impairment In the past physician ratings of patient symptoms did not correlate with patient We determined if urologists have improved their reporting of patient health related quality of life We also investigated if urologists assessed health related quality of life more accurately in the short or long identified men from CaPSURE a national prospective cohort who had undergone prostatectomy brachytherapy or external beam radiation therapy At each visit urologists assessed fatigue pain and sexual urinary and bowel dysfunction Participants independently completed the and the We contrasted the frequency of impairment reported by physicians and participants in select health related quality of life domains in the short less than 1 year and long greater than 2 years term We also compared concordance between the periods 1995 to 2000 and 2001 to and followup and for the 1995 to 2000 and 2001 to 2007 cohorts physician and participant assessments differed in all analyzed domains Urologists noted impairment in urinary and sexual function more often than fatigue or pain Disagreement between physician and participant ratings did not vary dramatically from to followup or from the earlier to the later men treated for localized prostate cancer physician ratings of symptoms do not correlate well with patient of health related quality of life Physician reporting did not improve

4 Abstract Confocal laser endomicroscopy is a new endoscopic imaging technology that could complement white light cystoscopy by providing in vivo bladder histopathology We evaluated confocal laser endomicroscopy by imaging normal malignant appearing and indeterminate bladder mucosa in a pilot scheduled to undergo transurethral resection of bladder tumors were recruited during a period After standard cystoscopy fluorescein was administered intravesically intravenously as a contrast dye A mm probe based confocal laser endomicroscope was passed through a 26 Fr resectoscope to image normal and abnormal appearing areas The images were collected with 488 nm excitation at 8 to 12 frames per second The endomicroscopic images were compared with standard hematoxylin and eosin analysis of transurethral resection of bladder tumor the 27 recruited patients 8 had no cancer 9 had low grade tumors 9 had high grade tumors and 1 had a low grade tumor with a high grade focus Endomicroscopic images demonstrated clear differences between normal mucosa and low and high grade tumors In normal urothelium larger umbrella cells are seen most superficially followed by smaller intermediate cells and the less cellular lamina propria In contrast low grade papillary tumors demonstrate densely arranged but small cells extending outward from fibrovascular cores High grade tumors show markedly irregular architecture and cellular report the first study to our knowledge of in vivo confocal laser endomicroscopy in the urinary tract Marked differences among normal urothelium low grade tumors and high grade tumors were visualized Pending further clinical investigation and technological improvement confocal laser endomicroscopy may become a useful adjunct to conventional cystoscopy View

the Risk of Cancer Associated With Imaging Related Radiation During Surveillance for Stage I Testicular Cancer Using Computerized Tomography JOURNAL OF UROLOGY Tarin Sonn Shinghal 2009 181 2 Abstract Computerized tomography has a critical role in the surveillance of stage I nonseminomatous germ cell tumors of the testis Some protocols call for up to 16 computerized tomography scans over 5 years thereby exposing young patients to a significant amount of radiation We estimated the lifetime risk of cancer incidence and cancer death from imaging related radiation received during surveillance of stage I nonseminomatous germ cell a model with a computerized tomography scanner obtaining images of the abdomen and pelvis with or without chest in a standardized phantom male patient organ specific radiation doses were estimated using Monte Carlo simulation techniques Lifetime attributable risks of cancer were estimated using the approach outlined in the Biological Effects of Ionizing Radiation VII Phase 2 a surveillance protocol as suggested by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network lifetime cancer risk ranged from 1 in 52 for an to 1 in 63 for a patient If chest computerized tomography is also performed the risk increases to 1 in 39 and 1 in 85 respectively Lung and colon cancer accounted for most of the risk The relative risk of a secondary malignancy with surveillance compared to a single scan after retroperitoneal lymph node dissection is approximately tomography used in testicular cancer surveillance protocols imparts large radiation doses and is associated with a significant risk of cancer This risk should be factored into counseling patients with stage I nonseminomatous germ cell tumor View details for DOI View details for Web of Science ID 000262419900070

malignancy in children In the 1930s overall survival for children with Wilms tumor was approximately 30 Use of multidisciplinary therapy guided by results from randomized trials has substantially improved overall survival to about 90 Management of Wilms tumor differs substantially between Europe and the US In Europe the International Society of Pediatric Oncology protocols call for management of patients with presumptive Wilms tumor with neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by nephrectomy and further chemotherapy In the US protocols developed by the National Wilms Tumor Study Group advise primary nephrectomy followed by a chemotherapy regimen tailored to the pathologic tumor stage Despite these disparate strategies overall survival is similar in patients managed according to European and US protocols Patients with Wilms tumor now have excellent survival Therefore current goals aim to reduce the morbidity associated with therapy Important complications of treatment for Wilms tumor include cardiomyopathy renal failure and increased risk of a secondary malignancy Currently the role of laparoscopic surgery in management of Wilms tumor remains extremely limited View details for DOI

work has been done in men with prostate cancer We sought to determine whether lower spirituality in men with early stage prostate cancer is associated with worse general quality of life HRQOL HRQOL or psychosocial health Two hundred and subjects were drawn from a program providing free prostate cancer treatment to indigent men Validated instruments captured spirituality general and HRQOL anxiety symptom distress and emotional We found a consistent relationship between spirituality and the outcomes assessed Low spirituality was associated with significantly worse physical and mental health sexual function and more urinary bother after controlling for covariates All of the psychosocial variables studied reflected worse adjustment in the men with low spirituality Because the likelihood of

suggest that environmental factors may mediate the transformation of latent prostate cancer into clinically apparent tumors and that diet appears to influence this progression Close correlations between average per capita fat intake and prostate cancer mortality internationally generated interest in underlying mechanisms for this link such as through serum levels of androgens free radicals proinflammatory fatty acid metabolites or growth factor Much interest currently lies in the potential of reductase inhibitors statins to play a chemopreventative role in prostate cancer Lycopene a potent antioxidant found in tomatoes may exert a protective effect in the prostate Selenium and vitamin E have also been shown to decrease the risk of prostate cancer in some men Calcium may support vitamin antiproliferative effects in prostate cancer Certain soy proteins common in the Asian diet have been shown to inhibit prostate cancer cell growth Finally green tea may also have a chemopreventive effect by inducing apoptosis Despite confounding factors present in clinical studies assessing the effect of diet on cancer risk the data remain compelling that a variety of nutrients
