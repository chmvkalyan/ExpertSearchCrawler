Links Lab Site Current Research and Scholarly Interests Our lab studies how intricate control of gene expression and cell signaling is regulated on a basis to give rise to the remarkable diversity of cell types and tissue morphology that form the living blueprints of developing organisms Work in the Barna lab is presently split into two main research efforts The first is investigating control of gene expression in space and time during cellular differentiation and organismal development This research is opening a new field of study in which we apply sophisticated mass spectrometry computational biology genomics and developmental genetics to characterize a ribosome code to gene expression Our research has shown that not all of the millions of ribosomes within a cell are the same and that ribosome heterogeneity can diversify how genomes are translated into proteomes In particular we seek to address whether fundamental aspects of gene regulation are controlled by ribosomes harboring a unique activity or composition that are tuned to translating specific transcripts by virtue of RNA regulatory elements embedded within their 5 UTRs The second research effort is centered on employing live cell imaging to visualize cell signaling and cellular control of organogenesis This research has led to the realization of a novel means of communication dependent on a dense network of cellular extension within developing organs that interconnect and facilitate the precise transmission of molecular information between cells We apply and create bioengineering tools to manipulate

have been suggested to directly control gene regulation but regulatory roles for ribosomal RNA rRNA remain largely unexplored Expansion segments ESs consist of multitudes of rRNA structures extending from the core ribosome in eukaryotes ESs are remarkably variable in sequence and size across eukaryotic evolution with largely unknown functions In characterizing ribosome binding to a regulatory element within a Homeobox Hox 5 UTR we identify a modular within this element that binds to a single ES ES9S Engineering chimeric humanized yeast ribosomes for ES9S reveals that an evolutionary change in the sequence of ES9S endows binding of Hoxa9 mRNA to the ribosome Genome editing to disrupt the interaction demonstrates the functional importance for such selective binding in translation control

the eukaryotic ribosome the longest of which resemble extensions that vary in length and sequence across evolution with a largely unknown function By selectively engineering rRNA in yeast we find that one of the largest ESs ES27L has an unexpected function in translation fidelity Ribosomes harboring a deletion in the distal portion of ES27L have increased amino acid misincorporation as well as readthrough and frameshifting errors Byemploying quantitative mass spectrometry we further find that ES27L acts as an RNA scaffold to facilitate binding of a conserved enzyme methionine amino peptidase MetAP We show that MetAP unexpectedly controls the accuracy of ribosome decoding which is coupled to an increase in its enzymatic function through its interaction with ES27L These findings reveal that variable ESs of the ribosome serve important functional roles and act as platforms for the binding of proteins that modulate translation across evolution View details for PubMedID 30576652 The Discovery of Ribosome Heterogeneity and Its Implications for Gene Regulation and Organismal Life Molecular cell Genuth Barna 2018 71 3 Abstract The ribosome has recently transitioned from being viewed as a passive indiscriminate machine to a more dynamic macromolecular complex with specialized roles in the cell Here we discuss the historical milestones from the discovery of the ribosome itself to how this ancient machinery has gained newfound appreciation as a more regulatory participant in the central dogma of gene expression The first emerging examples of direct changes in ribosome composition at the RNA and protein level coupled with an increased awareness of the role individual ribosomal components play in the translation of specific mRNAs is opening a new field of study centered on control of gene regulation In this Perspective we discuss our current understanding of the known functions for ribosome heterogeneity including specialized translation of individual transcripts and its implications for the regulation and expression of key gene regulatory networks In addition we suggest what the crucial next steps are to ascertain the extent of ribosome heterogeneity and specialization and its importance for regulation of the proteome within subcellular space across different cell types and during organismal development View details for PubMedID

considerably increased in size forming a ribosomal RNA rRNA shell of unknown function which may create an interface for yet uncharacterized interacting proteins To investigate such protein interactions we establish a ribosome affinity purification method that unexpectedly identifies hundreds of proteins RAPs from categories including metabolism and cell cycle as well as and enzymes that functionally diversify mammalian ribosomes By further characterizing RAPs we discover the presence of ufmylation a modification PTM on ribosomes and define its direct substrates Moreover we show that the metabolic enzyme pyruvate kinase muscle PKM interacts with of endoplasmic reticulum ER ribosomes exerting a function as an protein in the translation of mRNAs Therefore RAPs interconnect one of life most ancient molecular machines with diverse cellular processes providing an additional layer of regulatory potential to protein expression View details for DOI View details for PubMedID 28575669 Heterogeneous Ribosomes Preferentially Translate Distinct Subpools of mRNAs Molecular cell Shi Fujii Kovary Genuth Röst Teruel Barna 2017 Abstract Emerging studies have linked the ribosome to more selective control of gene regulation However an outstanding question is whether ribosome heterogeneity at the level of core ribosomal proteins RPs exists and enables ribosomes to preferentially translate specific mRNAs Here we measured the absolute abundance of RPs in translating ribosomes and profiled transcripts that are enriched or depleted from select subsets of ribosomes within embryonic stem cells We find that heterogeneity in RP composition endows ribosomes with differential selectivity for translating subpools of transcripts including those controlling metabolism cell cycle and development As an example mRNAs enriched in binding to ribosomes are shown to require for their efficient translation Within several of these transcripts this level of regulation is mediated at least in part by internal ribosome entry sites Together these results reveal a critical functional link between ribosome heterogeneity and the circuitry of gene expression View details for PubMedID 28625553 RNA regulons in Hox 5 UTRs confer ribosome specificity to gene regulation Nature Xue Tian Fujii Kladwang Das Barna 2015 517 7532 Abstract Emerging evidence suggests that the ribosome has a regulatory function in directing how the genome is translated in time and space However how this regulation is encoded in the messenger RNA sequence remains largely unknown Here we uncover unique RNA regulons embedded in homeobox Hox 5 untranslated regions UTRs that confer control of gene expression These structured RNA elements resembling viral internal ribosome entry sites IRESs are found in subsets of Hox mRNAs They facilitate ribosome recruitment and require the ribosomal protein RPL38 for their activity Despite numerous layers of Hox gene regulation these IRES elements are essential for converting Hox transcripts into proteins to pattern the mammalian body plan This specialized mode of translation is enabled by an additional regulatory element that we term the translation inhibitory element TIE which blocks translation of transcripts Together these data uncover a new paradigm for control of gene expression and organismal development View details for DOI View details

traverse tissues containing tightly packed cells is of fundamental importance for cell specification and tissue development however how this is achieved at a cellular level remains poorly understood For more than a century the vertebrate limb bud has served as a model for studying cell signalling during embryonic development Here we optimize imaging to delineate the cellular mechanisms for how signalling proteins such as sonic hedgehog SHH that possess covalent lipid modifications traverse long distances within the vertebrate limb bud in vivo By directly imaging SHH ligand production under native regulatory control in chick Gallus gallus embryos our findings show that SHH is unexpectedly produced in the form of a particle that remains associated with the cell via long cytoplasmic extensions that span several cell diameters We show that these cellular extensions are a specialized class of filopodia with novel cytoskeletal features that have not been previously described Notably particles containing SHH travel along these extensions with a net anterograde movement within the field of SHH cell signalling We further show that in cells specific subsets of SHH including cell adhesion molecule downregulated by oncogenes CDO and brother of CDO BOC actively distribute and in specific within filopodial extensions far from the cell body Stabilized interactions are formed between filopodia containing SHH ligand and those containing over a long range These results suggest that release propagated by specialized filopodia contributes to the delivery of SHH at a distance Together these studies identify an important mode of communication between cells that considerably extends our understanding of ligand movement and reception during vertebrate tissue patterning View

3 Abstract Historically the ribosome has been viewed as a complex ribozyme with constitutive rather than regulatory capacity in mRNA translation Here we identify mutations of the Ribosomal Protein L38 Rpl38 gene in mice exhibiting surprising patterning defects including pronounced homeotic transformations of the axial skeleton In Rpl38 mutant embryos global protein synthesis is unchanged however the translation of a select subset of Homeobox mRNAs is perturbed Our data reveal that RPL38 facilitates 80S complex formation on these mRNAs as a regulatory component of the ribosome to confer translational control We further show that Rpl38 expression is markedly enriched in regions of the embryo where phenotypes occur Unexpectedly a ribosomal protein RP expression screen reveals dynamic regulation of individual RPs within the vertebrate embryo Collectively these findings suggest that RP activity may be highly regulated to impart a new layer of specificity in the control of gene expression and mammalian development View details for DOI View details for Web of Science ID 000290022900008 View details for PubMedID 21529712 Suppression of Myc oncogenic activity by ribosomal protein haploinsufficiency NATURE Barna Pusic Zollo Costa Kondrashov Rego Rao Ruggero 2008 456 7224 Abstract The Myc oncogene regulates the expression of several components of the protein synthetic machinery including ribosomal proteins initiation factors of translation RNA polymerase III and ribosomal DNA Whether and how increasing the cellular protein synthesis capacity affects the multistep process leading to cancer remains to be addressed Here we use ribosomal protein heterozygote mice as a genetic tool to restore increased protein synthesis in transgenic mice to normal levels and show that the oncogenic potential of Myc in this context is suppressed Our findings demonstrate that the ability of Myc to increase protein synthesis directly augments cell size and is sufficient to accelerate cell cycle progression independently of known cell cycle targets transcriptionally regulated by Myc In addition when protein synthesis is restored to normal levels precancerous cells are more efficiently eliminated by programmed cell death Our findings reveal a new mechanism that links increases in general protein synthesis rates downstream of an oncogenic signal to a specific molecular impairment in the modality of translation initiation used to regulate the expression of selective messenger RNAs We show that an aberrant increase in translation downstream of Myc hyperactivation specifically impairs the translational switch to internal ribosomal entry site IRES translation that is required for accurate mitotic progression Failure of this translational switch results in reduced expression of the endogenous form of Cdk11 also known as Cdc2l and PITSLRE which leads to cytokinesis defects and is associated with increased centrosome numbers and genome instability in mice When accurate translational control is in mice genome instability is suppressed Our findings demonstrate how perturbations in translational control provide a highly specific outcome for gene expression genome stability and cancer initiation that have important implications for understanding the molecular mechanism of cancer formation at the level View details for DOI View

Asthana Barna Webster Cunningham Ruggero 2019 Abstract Cancer cells develop mechanisms to escape immunosurveillance among which modulating the expression of immune suppressive messenger RNAs is most However how this is molecularly achieved remains largely unresolved Here we develop an in vivo mouse model of liver cancer to study oncogene cooperation in immunosurveillance We show that MYC overexpression MYCTg synergizes with KRASG12D to induce an aggressive liver tumor leading to metastasis formation and reduced mouse survival compared with KRASG12D alone ribosomal footprinting of MYCTg KRASG12 tumors compared with KRASG12D revealed potential alterations in translation of mRNAs including 1 Further analysis revealed that translation is repressed in KRASG12D tumors by functional upstream open reading frames in its 5 untranslated region which is bypassed in MYCTg KRASG12D tumors to evade immune attack We show that this mechanism of translational upregulation was effectively targeted by a potent clinical compound that inhibits eIF4E phosphorylation eFT508 which reverses the aggressive and metastatic characteristics of MYCTg KRASG12D tumors Together these studies reveal how proteins are manipulated by distinct oncogenes at the level of mRNA translation which can be exploited for new immunotherapies View details for PubMedID 30643286 RPS25 is required for efficient

Unconventional translation RAN translation of C9orf72 repeats generates dipeptide repeat proteins that can cause neurodegeneration We performed a genetic screen for regulators of RAN translation and

Genuth Barna 2018 Abstract Regulation of mRNA translation offers the opportunity to diversify the expression and abundance of proteins made from individual gene products in cells tissues and organisms Emerging evidence has highlighted variation in the composition and activity of several large highly conserved translation complexes as a means to differentially control gene expression Heterogeneity and specialized functions of individual components of the ribosome and of the translation initiation factor complexes eIF3 and eIF4F which are required for recruitment of the ribosome to the mRNA 5 untranslated region have been identified In this Review we summarize the evidence for selective mRNA translation by components of these macromolecular complexes as a means to dynamically control the translation of the proteome in time and space We further discuss the implications of this form of gene expression regulation for a growing number of human genetic disorders associated with mutations in the translation machinery View details for PubMedID 29725087 The p53 family members have distinct roles during mammalian embryonic development Cell death and differentiation Van Nostrand Bowen Vogel Barna Attardi 2017 Abstract The p53 tumor suppressor is a member of a family including the p63 and p73 transcription factors These proteins can bind to the same consensus sites in DNA and activate the same target genes suggesting that there could be functional redundancy between them Indeed double mutant mice heterozygous for any two family genes display enhanced cancer phenotypes relative to single heterozygous mutants However whether the family members play redundant roles during embryonic development has remained largely unexplored Although p53 p73 mice are born and manifest phenotypes characteristic of each of the single mutants the consequences of combined deficiency of p63 and either p53 or p73 have not been elucidated To examine the functional overlap of p53 family members during development we bred and analyzed compound mutant embryo phenotypes We discovered that double knockout embryos and five allele knockout embryos only displayed obvious defects accounted for by loss of single p53 family members Surprisingly at E11 we identified a single viable triple knockout embryo that appeared grossly normal Together these results suggest that the p53 family is not absolutely required for early embryogenesis and that p53 family members are largely during early development View details for DOI View details for PubMedID 28211873 Pervasive translational regulation

translational regulation of most of the core signalling circuitry including Shh Wnt Hippo PI3K and MAPK pathways We further identify and functionally characterize a complex landscape of upstream open reading frames uORFs across regions UTRs of key signalling components Focusing on the Shh pathway we demonstrate the importance of uORFs within the major SHH receptor Ptch1 in control of cell signalling and neuronal differentiation Finally we show that the expression of hundreds of mRNAs underlying critical developmental processes is largely regulated at the translation but not transcript

their sequence In this Review we discuss the current mechanistic understanding of structures in 5 untranslated regions UTRs of eukaryotic mRNAs and the emerging methodologies used to explore them These structures may regulate translation initiation through remodelling of RNA structures and RNA interactions as well as translation initiation through internal ribosome entry sites IRESs mRNA modifications and other specialized translation pathways We discuss known 5 UTR RNA structures and how new structure probing technologies coupled with prospective validation particularly compensatory mutagenesis are likely to identify classes of structured RNA elements that shape control of gene expression and the development of multicellular organisms View details for PubMedID 29165424 An emerging role for the ribosome as a nexus for modifications Current opinion in cell biology Simsek Barna 2017 45 Abstract The ribosome is one of life most ancient molecular machines that has historically been viewed as a backstage participant in gene regulation translating the genetic code across all kingdoms of life in a fashion However recent studies suggest that intrinsic components of the ribosome can be regulated and diversified as a means to intricately control the expression of the cellular proteome In this review we discuss advances in the characterization of ribosome modifications PTMs from past to present We specifically focus on emerging examples of ribosome phosphorylation and ubiquitylation which are beginning to showcase that PTMs of the ribosome are versatile may have functional consequences for translational control and are intimately linked to human disease We further highlight the key questions that remain to be addressed to gain a more complete picture of the array of ribosome PTMs and the upstream enzymes that control them which may endow ribosomes with greater regulatory potential in gene regulation and control of cellular

biology Shi Barna 2015 31 Abstract A central question in cell and developmental biology is how the information encoded in the genome is differentially interpreted to generate a diverse array of cell types A growing body of research on posttranscriptional gene regulation is revealing that both global protein synthesis rates and the translation of specific mRNAs are highly specialized in different cell types How this exquisite translational regulation is achieved is the focus of this review Two levels of regulation are discussed the translation machinery and elements within mRNAs Recent evidence shows that the ribosome itself directs how the genome is translated in time and space and reveals surprising functional specificity in individual components of the core translation machinery We are also just beginning to appreciate the rich regulatory information embedded in the untranslated regions of mRNAs which direct the selective translation of transcripts These hidden RNA regulons may interface with a myriad of proteins and specialized translation machinery to provide an additional layer of regulation to how transcripts are spatiotemporally expressed Understanding this largely unexplored world of translational codes hardwired in the core translation machinery is an exciting new research frontier fundamental to our understanding of gene regulation organismal development and

protein has long been considered limiting for translating the mammalian genome However the eIF4E dose requirement at an organismal level remains unexplored By generating an Eif4e haploinsufficient mouse we found that a 50 reduction in eIF4E expression while compatible with normal development and global protein synthesis significantly impeded cellular transformation translational profiling uncovered a translational program induced by oncogenic transformation and revealed a critical role for the dose of eIF4E specifically in translating a network of mRNAs enriched for a unique 5 UTR signature In particular we demonstrate that the dose of eIF4E is essential for translating mRNAs that regulate reactive oxygen species fueling transformation and cancer cell survival in vivo Our findings indicate eIF4E is maintained at levels in excess for normal development that are hijacked by cancer cells to drive a translational program supporting tumorigenesis View details for DOI View

the specialized translation of specific subpools of mRNAs in particular at the level of ribosomal proteins RP However the mechanism s by which this selection takes place has remained poorly understood In our recent study we discovered a combination of unique RNA elements in the of mRNAs that allows for such control by the ribosome These mRNAs contain a Translation Inhibitory Element TIE that inhibits general translation and an Internal Ribosome Entry Site IRES that relies on a specific RP for activation The unique combination of an inhibitor of general translation and an activator of specialized translation is key to control of gene expression Here we discuss how these RNA regulatory elements provide a new level of control to protein expression and their implications for gene

opinion in genetics development Fairchild Barna 2014 27C Abstract For over a century biologists have strived to unravel the mechanisms that establish how cells are informed of their position in the embryo and differentiate to give rise to complex organs and structures However the historical idea that one predominant mode of ligand transport largely accounted for by free diffusion can explain how all signaling molecules known as morphogens control tissue patterning has greatly hindered our ability to fully appreciate the complexities driving the delivery and reception of signaling molecules at a distance In reality a cell shape morphology and location change continuously as development progresses Thus cellular context poses distinct challenges for morphogen transport in each unique cellular environment Emerging studies reveal that some cells overcome such obstacles in an unexpected manner via long cellular projections or specialized filopodia that link distant cells and traffic signaling

ribosome composition resulting from differential expression and modifications of ribosomal proteins ribosomal RNA rRNA diversity and the activity of factors may generate ribosomes that have a substantial impact on how the genomic template is translated into functional proteins Moreover constitutive components of the ribosome may also exert more specialized activities by virtue of their interactions with specific mRNA regulatory elements such as internal ribosome entry sites IRESs or upstream open reading frames uORFs Here we discuss the hypothesis that intrinsic regulation by the

condensations that prefigure all limb skeletal components Of the three cardinal limb axes the mechanisms that lead to establishment and patterning of skeletal elements along the axis are the least understood Here we identify a genetic interaction between Gli3 family member 3 and Plzf promyelocytic leukaemia zinc finger also known as Zbtb16 and Zfp145 which is required specifically at very early stages of limb development for all proximal cartilage condensations in the hindlimb femur tibia fibula Notably distal condensations comprising the foot are relatively unperturbed in Gli3 Plzf mouse embryos We demonstrate that the cooperative activity of Gli3 and Plzf establishes the correct temporal and spatial distribution of chondrocyte progenitors in the proximal independently of known patterning markers and overall size Moreover the limb defects in Gli3 Plzf embryos correlate with the transient death of a specific subset of proximal mesenchymal cells that express bone morphogenetic protein receptor type 1B Bmpr1b at the onset of limb development These findings suggest that the development of proximal and distal skeletal elements is distinctly regulated early during formation The initial division of the vertebrate limb into two distinct molecular domains is consistent with fossil evidence indicating that the upper and lower extremities of the limb have different evolutionary

Plzf regulates the spatial expression of the AbdB HoxD gene complex by binding to regulatory elements required for restricted Hox gene expression and can recruit histone deacetylases to these sites We show by scanning forced microscopy that Plzf via homodimerization can form DNA loops and bridge distant Plzf binding sites located within HoxD gene regulatory elements Furthermore we demonstrate that Plzf physically interacts with Polycomb proteins on DNA We propose a model by which the balance between activating morphogenic signals and transcriptional repressors such as Plzf establishes proper Hox gene expression boundaries in the limb bud View details for Web of Science ID 000178629300008 View details for PubMedID 12408802 Plzf regulates limb and axial skeletal patterning NATURE GENETICS Barna Hawe Niswander Pandolfi 2000 25 2 Abstract The promyelocytic leukaemia zinc finger Plzf protein encoded by the gene Zfp145 belongs to the family of transcription factors Here we generate mice and show that Plzf is essential for patterning of the limb and axial skeleton Plzf inactivation results in patterning defects affecting all skeletal structures of the limb including homeotic transformations of anterior skeletal elements into posterior structures We demonstrate that Plzf acts as a and factor in the limb bud The expression of members of the abdominal b Abdb Hox gene complex as well as genes encoding bone morphogenetic proteins Bmps is altered in the developing limb of mice Plzf regulates the expression of these genes in the absence of aberrant polarizing activity and independently of known patterning genes mice also exhibit homeotic transformation throughout the axial skeleton with associated alterations in Hox gene expression Plzf is therefore a mediator of AP patterning in both the axial and appendicular skeleton and acts as a regulator of Hox gene expression View details for Web of Science ID 000087459200014 View details for PubMedID 10835630 promotes

Type III nitric oxide synthase type III NOS also known as endothelial cell nitric oxide synthase eNOS or ecNOS or is a constitutively expressed and isoform of NOS Its expression has been localized to endothelial cells and a subset of neurons in the brain We report here that resident astrocytes of the central nervous system CNS of mice express type III NOS Following an experimental neurotropic viral infection the expression of type III NOS on reactive astrocytes increases substantially predominantly in virally infected regions of the brain This upregulation of type III NOS expression is also evident following cytokine treatment in vitro The intraperitoneal administration of a potent activator of and production results in a substantial increase in type III NOS immunoreactivity in astrocytes activation of type III NOS is observed in vitro following exposure of a C6 glioma cells which constitutively express type III NOS to and treatment We conclude that astrocytes of the murine CNS express type III NOS which may be positively regulated by a number of cytokines following viral infection Type III NOS expression by astrocytes represents a novel source of nitric oxide in the brain It may be important in regulating perfusion and maintaining the barrier Given the intimate association of astrocytes with endothelial cells and neurons increased activity of type III NOS following viral infection may be beneficial in inhibition of viral infection in neighboring cells View details for Web of Science ID A1996VJ81000007 View details for PubMedID 8806568 Sex differences in susceptibility to viral infection of the central nervous system JOURNAL OF NEUROIMMUNOLOGY Barna Komatsu Bi Z Reiss 1996 67 1 Abstract We have characterized striking differences in recovery of male and female and dm2 mice from an experimental neurotropic viral infection of the central nervous system CNS Following intranasal inoculation of vesicular stomatitis virus VSV assays of tissue homogenates from female mice produced lower viral titers There was also a significant reduction in the spread of virus from the rostral to caudal end of the brain in female mice Enhanced recovery by female mice of both strains in response to this viral insult correlates with increased levels of Nitric Oxide Synthase NOS types I II and III expression an increased prevalence of reactive astrocytes earlier and enhanced levels of expression of Major Histocompatibility Complex MHC class II molecules on astrocytes endothelial and microglial cells and increased T cell infiltration in the female mouse Taken together these findings document sexual dimorphism in CNS immunity and may provide an understanding of some of the mechanisms underlying many diseases View details for Web of Science ID

vesicular stomatitis virus infection of the central nervous system in mice VIRAL IMMUNOLOGY CHRISTIAN Barna Bi Z Reiss 1996 9 3 Abstract In this report the kinetics of cellular inflammatory changes in the brain of vesicular stomatitis virus VSV B6 mice was determined The behavior and survival rate of infected B6 were carefully monitored each day Infectious viral titers and VSV antigen distribution were determined at several time points during the course of infection Strong activation of both astrocytes and microglia was observed after VSV infection Induction of type II nitric oxide synthase iNOS was detected in activated microglia in the olfactory bulb OB starting at day 4 postinfection Induced expression of major histocompatibility complex MHC molecules and rapid infiltration of both T cells and natural killer NK cells were detected in the CNS Collectively these data indicate that the response to CNS infection in B6 mice which is often primarily Th1 in characteristics is comparable to mice a strain that often shows a immune response View details for Web of Science ID A1996VK05900007 View details for PubMedID 8890478 PROMOTES ENHANCED RECOVERY FROM VESICULAR INFECTION OF THE JOURNAL OF IMMUNOLOGY Bi Z QUANDT Komatsu Barna Reiss 1995 155 12 Abstract To investigate the role of a cytokine in host defense against the vesicular stomatitis virus VSV infection of the central nervous system CNS was injected into groups of 10 mice on days 0 1 2 and 3 postinfection Four days postinfection mice were examined strongly enhanced immunity to VSV infection in the CNS as demonstrated by 1 decreased VSV titers in brain homogenate of mice compared with those of controls 2 increased expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase in the CNS 3 enhanced expression of both MHC class I and class II Ags in the CNS 4 increased T cell infiltration in the CNS especially in the olfactory bulb and 5 diminished apoptosis in olfactory bulb No detrimental effect was observed even with the 200 dose of Protective effects of were dose dependent Collectively these results demonstrate that exogenously added even when injected peripherally significantly enhances recovery from VSV

Reiss 1995 69 10 Abstract Vesicular stomatitis virus VSV causes acute infection of the central nervous system CNS when intranasally applied We have examined cellular inflammatory changes in the CNS following VSV infection As early as 1 day postinfection astrocytes were activated in the olfactory bulb OB This was followed by activation of microglia first observed in the OB at day 3 Expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase was observed in activated microglia in the OB at day 3 and increased inducible nitric oxide synthase expression coincided with decreased virus titers in tissue homogenates Expression of major histocompatibility complex MHC class I molecules on astrocytes and microglial endothelial and ependymal cells was also rapidly induced and followed by induced expression of MHC class II molecules on astrocytes and microglial and endothelial cells Consistent with the pattern of viral dissemination MHC molecules were expressed temporally from the direction Infiltration of cells was observed as early as 1 day in the OB cells were detected in the OB at day 4 Increasing infiltration coincided with decreased virus titers In contrast infiltration of the CNS was not detected until day 14 after the virus was cleared and mice were showing behavioral signs of recovery Breakdown of the barrier was detected beginning at day 6 was most severe at day 8 and was followed by full recovery Collectively these data show that both innate immunity production of nitric oxide and acquired immunity expression of MHC molecules and infiltration are activated following VSV infection in the CNS View details for Web of Science ID A1995RU78400061 View details for PubMedID 7545248 Report Accessibility Issues Powered By CAP Network Stanford University SU Home Maps
