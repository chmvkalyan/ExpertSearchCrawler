emotional health and levels of perceived stress appears to decline during training with students reporting high levels of depression anxiety and burnout as early as the first year of medical school The impact of curricular changes on health and stress remains unclear and a modified curriculum that compresses training of the foundational sciences and its effect on wellness has not been studied Oregon Health Science University School of Medicine has recently instituted a unique model which provides an important opportunity to assess the effects of curricular change on student Assess the effects of curricular change on student Medical students at a single institution were administered the an quality of life survey as well as the Perceived Stress Scale a scale that measures the degree to which life situations are appraised as stressful at baseline matriculation and at the end of Year 1 2 and 3 Individual variables were assessed over time as well as a trend analysis of summary domain scores over the 4 time Physical emotional and overall health were highest at baseline and lowest at the end of Year 1 after which they improved but never again reached baseline levels Physical health declined less than emotional health Perceived stress levels did not change over time but remained moderately high There were no differences in health or perceived stress based on demographic In a curriculum physical emotional and overall health significantly worsened during Year 1 but improved thereafter while perceived stress remained unchanged Early in training stress and poor overall health may be related to concerns about and workload Although advanced students show improved wellness concerns remained about emotional difficulties such as anxiety and irritability and feeling a

Hartman Weygandt Jones Moore 2019 21 1 Abstract Electrocardiogram EKG interpretation is integral to emergency medicine EM In 2003 Ginde et al found 48 of emergency medicine EM residency directors supported creating a national EKG curriculum No formal national curriculum exists and it is unknown whether residents gain sufficient skill from clinical exposure authors sought to assess the value of this EKG curriculum which provides exposure to critical EKG patterns a framework for EKG interpretation when the diagnosis is not obvious and implementation guidelines and open access to any interested residency The Foundations of Emergency Medicine FoEM EKG I course launched in January 2016 followed by EKG II in July 2017 they are benchmarked to year 1 PGY and PGY2 level learners respectively Selected topics included 15 published critical EKG diagnoses and 33 selected by the authors Cases included presenting symptoms EKGs and Free Open Access Medical Education FOAM links Full EKG interpretations and question answers were during included 37 EM residencies with 663 learners in EKG I and 22 EM residencies with 438 learners in EKG II Program leaders and learners were surveyed annually Leaders indicated that content was appropriate for intended PGY levels Leaders and learners indicated the curriculum improved the ability of learners to interpret EKGs while working in the emergency department ED is an unmet need for standardization and improvement of EM resident EKG training Leaders and learners exposed to FoEM EKG courses report improved ability of learners to

Kraut Lloyd Silvester Sorge Wain Gottlieb 2019 11 4 e4383 Abstract Introduction The Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education calls graduated responsibility one of the core tenets of American graduate medical education However there is no clear set of resources for programs to implement a system of progressively increasing responsibilities for trainees This project aimed to identify a set of papers on graduated responsibility for junior faculty members Methods A study group of Academic Life in Emergency Medicine Faculty Incubator participants identified relevant literature on graduated responsibility via a comprehensive literature search and a call to the online medical education community 59 total papers were identified The most relevant and applicable were selected by the study group via a modified Delphi process Results Five key articles for junior faculty interested in implementing more robust graduated responsibility at their residency training program were selected and described here Summaries of key points along with considerations for faculty developers and relevance to junior faculty are presented for each article Conclusions The articles presented here provide a solid theoretical and practical basis for junior faculty to explore graduated responsibility The five articles presented here provide the junior faculty with a toolkit to examine and improve their systems for assigning responsibilities in a graded fashion at their own institutions View details for DOI View details for PubMedID 31218147 View details for

1 e2021 Abstract Traditionally scholarship that was recognized for promotion and tenure consisted of clinical research bench research and grant funding Recent trends have allowed for differing approaches to scholarship including digital publication As increasing numbers of trainees and faculty turn to online educational resources it is imperative to critically evaluate these resources This article summarizes five key papers that address the appraisal of digital scholarship and describes their relevance to junior clinician educators and faculty developers In May 2017 the Academic Life in Emergency Medicine Faculty Incubator program focused on the topic of digital scholarship providing and discussing papers relevant to the topic We augmented this list of papers with further suggestions by guest experts and by an open call via Twitter for other important papers Through this process we created a list of 38 papers in total on the topic of evaluating digital scholarship In order to determine which of these papers best describe how to evaluate digital scholarship the authorship group assessed the papers using a modified Delphi approach to build consensus In this paper we present the five most highly rated papers from our process about evaluating digital scholarship We summarize each paper and discuss its specific relevance to junior faculty members and to faculty developers These papers provide a framework for assessing the quality of digital scholarship so that junior faculty can recommend educational resources to their trainees These papers help guide educators on how to produce high quality digital scholarship and maximize recognition and credit in respect to receiving promotion and tenure View details for PubMedID 29531874 The View From Over Here A Framework for

breast cancer axillary surgery within the surveillance epidemiology and end database JOURNAL OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY Schmocker Weiss Ronk Havlena Loconte Decker Smith Greenberg Neuman B 2014 109 8 Abstract Use of sentinel lymph node biopsy SLNB is by cancer registries Scope of Regional Lymph Node Surgery variable In 2011 the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results SEER Program recommended against its use to determine extent of axillary surgery leaving a gap in the utilization of claims data for breast cancer research The objective was to develop an algorithm using SEER registry and claims data to classify extent of axillary surgery for breast analyzed data for breast cancer patients CPT codes and number of examined lymph nodes classified the extent of axillary surgery The final algorithm was validated by comparing the algorithm derived extent of axillary surgery to direct chart review for 100 breast cancer patients treated at our breast the algorithm 13 had no axillary surgery 56 SLNB and 31 axillary lymph node dissection ALND SLNB was performed in 77 of node negative patients and ALND in 72 of node positive In our validation study concordance between algorithm and direct chart review was 97 recognized inaccuracies in cancer registries Scope of Regional Lymph Node Surgery variable these findings have high utility for health services researchers studying breast

Receptors NEUROPSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY Mantsch Weyer Vranjkovic Beyer Baker Caretta 2010 35 11 Abstract The responsiveness of central noradrenergic systems to stressors and cocaine poses norepinephrine as a potential common mechanism through which drug and stressful stimuli promote relapse This study investigated the role of noradrenergic systems in the reinstatement of extinguished conditioned place preference by cocaine and stress in male mice 15 induced conditioned place preference was extinguished by repeated exposure to the apparatus in the absence of drug and reestablished by a cocaine challenge 15 exposure to a stressor forced swim FS water or administration of the adrenergic receptor AR antagonists yohimbine 2 or BRL44408 5 10 To investigate the role of ARs mice were administered the nonselective antagonist propranolol 5 10 the AR antagonist prazosin 1 2 or the AR agonist clonidine before reinstatement testing Clonidine prazosin and propranolol failed to block reinstatement The low but not high clonidine dose fully blocked reinstatement but not reinstatement by yohimbine Propranolol but not prazosin blocked reinstatement by both yohimbine and FS suggesting the involvement of The AR antagonist 1 but not the AR antagonist betaxolol 10 also blocked reinstatement These findings suggest that reinstatement requires noradrenergic signaling through ARs and that reinstatement does not require AR activation even though stimulation of central noradrenergic neurotransmission is sufficient to reinstate View details for DOI View details for Web of Science ID
