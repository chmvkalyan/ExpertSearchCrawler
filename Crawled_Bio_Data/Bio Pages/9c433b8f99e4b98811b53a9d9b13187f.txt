dramatically different behaviors For example consider the mechanical abilities of a muscle cell compared to the electrical excitability of a neuron or the industrious activity of bone building cells in a youthful person compared to an elderly one Each of these cells if taken from the same individual has an identical genome and yet each is reading a very distinct subset of that genome and consequently carrying out very different behaviors The choice of what to read and what to hide away is made during development An increasing body of data suggests this is accomplished by modifying the genome both in the nature of the proteins bound to different sequences and in the spatial organization of those sequences relative to each other The spatial organization or folding of the genome may be particularly important in complex multicellular organisms since many of the sequences known to interact based on genetic data are nonetheless substantially separated from each other along the linear genome By regulating the folding of this linear sequence into a higher order structure a cell might change which regulatory sequences have access to which genes and achieve different behavioral far we have little imaging data on how the genome is folded within a cell on the length scale of individual genes or whether this folding is regulated in any way relevant to the behavior of the cell Our limited knowledge stems largely from want of a method that has both the resolution and specificity to visualize such genomic substructure Conventional fluorescent microscopy has developed excellent tools for coloring specific regions of DNA and particular proteins with uniquely colored dyes but lacks the resolution to turn these colored blurs into structures has substantially greater resolution but lacks compatibility with specific labeling techniques to tell different gene clusters or different protein types apart imaging approaches promise to address this balance by allowing the use of fluorescent labels while simultaneously resolving structures on the I have been adapting this approach to uncover the structure of chromatin and determine to how this structure changes when bound by different types of nuclear proteins While individual gene clusters appear as quite diverse structures there appear to be a few general features for example linking structure with the

appreciated that the spatial organization of the genome is nonrandom and its complex 3D folding has important consequences for many genome processes Recent developments in multiplexed microscopy have enabled an unprecedented view of the polymeric structure of chromatin from the loose folds of whole chromosomes to the detailed loops of elements that regulate gene expression Facilitated by the use of robotics microfluidics and improved approaches to thousands to hundreds of thousands of individual cells can now be analyzed in an individual experiment This has led to new insights into the nature of genomic structural features identified by sequencing such as topologically associated domains TADs and the nature of interactions underlying transcriptional regulation We review these recent

types in complex tissue and relate to transcription Here we describe optical reconstruction of chromatin architecture ORCA a method that can trace the DNA path in single cells with nanoscale accuracy and genomic resolution reaching two kilobases We used ORCA to study a Hox gene cluster in cryosectioned Drosophila embryos and labelled around 30 RNA species in parallel We identified physical borders between active and DNA and unexpected borders Deletion of borders led to ectopic contacts aberrant gene expression and developmental defects Together these results illustrate an approach for DNA

organization of chromatin is pivotal for regulating genome functions We report an imaging method for tracing chromatin organization with and resolution unveiling chromatin conformation across topologically associating domains TADs in thousands of individual cells Our imaging data revealed structures with globular conformation and sharp domain boundaries in single cells The boundaries varied from cell to cell occurring with nonzero probabilities at all genomic positions but preferentially at factor CTCF and sites Notably cohesin depletion which abolished TADs at the level did not diminish structures in single cells but eliminated preferential domain boundary positions Moreover we observed widespread cooperative multiway chromatin interactions which remained after cohesin depletion These results provide critical insight into the mechanisms underlying chromatin domain and hub formation View details for PubMedID 30361340 In Situ Imaging of Genomic DNA with OligoSTORM and

transcriptome has emerged as a powerful means for regulating the fate of RNA in eukaryotes however whether prokaryotes use RNA spatial organization as a mechanism for regulation remains unclear Here we used microscopy to image the coli transcriptome and observed a spatial organization of RNA mRNAs encoding proteins are enriched at the membrane whereas mRNAs encoding cytoplasmic and periplasmic proteins are distributed throughout the cytoplasm Membrane enrichment is caused by insertion of signal peptides recognized by the particle revealed that degradation rates of mRNAs are on average greater that those of the other mRNAs and that this selective destabilization of mRNAs is abolished by dissociating the RNA degradosome from the membrane Together these results demonstrate that the bacterial transcriptome is spatially organized and suggest that this organization shapes the dynamics of mRNAs View details for DOI View details for Web of Science ID 000376881500001 View details for

Mirny Wu Zhuang X 2016 529 7586 Abstract Metazoan genomes are spatially organized at multiple scales from packaging of DNA around individual nucleosomes to segregation of whole chromosomes into distinct territories At the intermediate scale of kilobases to megabases which encompasses the sizes of genes gene clusters and regulatory domains the 3D organization of DNA is implicated in multiple gene regulatory mechanisms but understanding this organization remains a challenge At this scale the genome is partitioned into domains of different epigenetic states that are essential for regulating gene expression Here we investigate the 3D organization of chromatin in different epigenetic states using imaging We classified genomic domains in Drosophila cells into transcriptionally active inactive or states and observed distinct chromatin organizations for each state All three types of chromatin domains exhibit scaling between their physical sizes in 3D and their domain lengths but each type has a distinct scaling exponent domains show the densest packing and most intriguing chromatin folding behaviour in which chromatin packing density increases with domain length Distinct from the organization displayed by transcriptionally active and inactive chromatin the domains are characterized by a high degree of chromatin intermixing within the domain Moreover compared to inactive domains domains spatially exclude neighbouring active chromatin to a much stronger degree Computational modelling and knockdown experiments suggest that reversible chromatin interactions mediated by proteins play an important role in these unique packaging properties of the repressed chromatin Taken together our images reveal distinct chromatin packaging for different epigenetic states at the scale a length scale that is directly relevant to genome regulation View details for DOI View details for Web of Science ID 000368354800051 View details for PubMedID 26760202 View details for

J 2016 7 Abstract The genomes of metazoa are organized at multiple scales Many proteins that regulate genome architecture including Polycomb group PcG proteins form subnuclear structures Deciphering mechanistic links between protein organization and chromatin architecture requires precise description and mechanistic perturbations of both Using microscopy here we show that PcG proteins are organized into hundreds of nanoscale protein clusters We manipulated PcG clusters by disrupting the polymerization activity of the sterile alpha motif SAM of the PcG protein Polyhomeotic Ph or by increasing Ph levels Ph with mutant SAM disrupts clustering of endogenous PcG complexes and chromatin interactions while elevating Ph level increases cluster number and chromatin interactions These effects can be captured by molecular simulations based on a previously described chromatin polymer model Both perturbations also alter gene expression Organization of PcG proteins into small abundant

12 Abstract Deterministic thermodynamic models of the complex systems which control gene expression in metazoa are helping researchers identify fundamental themes in the regulation of transcription However quantitative single cell studies are increasingly identifying regulatory mechanisms that control variability in expression Such behaviors can not be captured by deterministic models and are poorly suited to contemporary stochastic approaches that rely on continuum approximations such as Langevin methods Fortunately theoretical advances in the modeling of transcription have assembled some general results that can be readily applied to systems being explored only through a deterministic approach Here I review some of the recent experimental evidence for the importance of genetically regulating stochastic effects during embryonic development and discuss key results from Markov theory that can be used to model this regulation I then discuss several pairs of regulatory mechanisms recently investigated through a Markov approach In each case a deterministic treatment predicts no difference between the mechanisms but the statistical treatment reveals the potential for substantially different distributions of transcriptional activity In this light features of gene regulation that seemed needlessly complex evolutionary baggage may be appreciated for their key contributions to reliability and precision of gene expression View details for DOI View details for Web of Science ID 000328597400008 View details for PubMedID 24359735 View details for

highly stochastic process resulting in considerable heterogeneity of gene expression among the different cells in a population Here we employ quantitative in situ hybridization methods coupled with imaging assays to measure the expression of snail a developmental patterning gene necessary for coordinating the invagination of the mesoderm during gastrulation of the Drosophila embryo Our measurements of mRNAs suggest that there is very little variation in snail expression across the different cells that make up the mesoderm and that synthesis approaches the kinetic limits of Pol II processivity We propose that rapid transcription kinetics and negative autoregulation are responsible for the remarkable homogeneity of snail expression and the coordination of mesoderm invagination

patterns in the Drosophila embryo PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA Perry Boettiger Levine 2011 108 33 Abstract Segmentation of the Drosophila embryo begins with the establishment of spatially restricted gap patterns in response to broad gradients of maternal transcription factors such as Bicoid Numerous studies have documented the fidelity of these expression patterns even when embryos are subjected to genetic or environmental stress but the underlying mechanisms for this transcriptional precision are uncertain Here we present evidence that every gap gene contains multiple enhancers with overlapping activities to produce authentic patterns of gene expression For example a recently identified hunchback hb enhancer located upstream of the classic enhancer ensures repression at the anterior pole The combination of intronic and 5 knirps kni enhancers produces a faithful expression pattern even though the intronic enhancer alone directs an abnormally broad expression pattern We present different models for enhancer synergy whereby two enhancers with overlapping activities produce authentic patterns of gene expression View

elephant movement using a linear filtering approach ECOLOGY Boettiger Wittemyer Starfield Volrath Getz 2011 92 8 Abstract Understanding the environmental factors influencing animal movements is fundamental to theoretical and applied research in the field of movement ecology Studies relating movement paths to spatiotemporally structured landscape data such as vegetation productivity or human activity are particularly lacking despite the obvious importance of such information to understanding drivers of animal movement In part this may be because few approaches provide the sophistication to characterize the complexity of movement behavior and relate it to diverse varying environmental stimuli We overcame this hurdle by applying for the first time to an ecological question a finite approach to identify human and natural environmental drivers of movements of 13 African elephants Loxodonta africana from distinct social groups collected over seven years A minimum error MMSE estimation criterion allowed comparison of the predictive power of landscape and ecological model inputs We showed that a filter combining vegetation dynamics human and physical landscape features and previous movement outperformed simpler filter structures indicating the importance of both dynamic and static landscape features as well as habit on movement decisions taken by elephants Elephant responses to vegetation productivity indices were not uniform in time or space indicating that elephant foraging strategies are more complex than simply gravitation toward areas of high productivity Predictions were most frequently inaccurate outside protected area boundaries near human settlements suggesting that human activity disrupts typical elephant movement behavior Successful management strategies at the interface therefore are likely to be context specific and dynamic Signal processing provides a promising approach for elucidating environmental factors that drive animal movements

Synchrony and Reliability PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY Boettiger Ralph Evans 2011 7 5 Abstract Recent whole genome polymerase binding assays in the Drosophila embryo have shown that a substantial proportion of uninduced genes have RNA transcription initiation complex PIC bound to their promoters These constitute a subset of promoter proximally paused genes for which mRNA elongation instead of promoter access is regulated This difference can be described as a rearrangement of the regulatory topology to control the downstream transcriptional process of elongation rather than the upstream transcriptional initiation event It has been shown experimentally that genes with the former mode of regulation tend to induce faster and more synchronously and that pausing is observed mainly in metazoans in accord with a posited impact on synchrony However it has not been shown whether or not it is the change in the regulated step per se that is causal We investigate this question by proposing and analyzing a Markov chain model of PIC assembly regulated at one of two steps initial polymerase association with DNA or release from a paused transcribing state Our analysis demonstrates that over a wide range of physical parameters increased speed and synchrony are functional consequences of elongation control Further we make new predictions about the effect of elongation regulation on the consistent control of total transcript number between cells We also identify which elements in the transcription induction pathway are most sensitive to molecular noise and thus possibly the most evolutionarily constrained Our methods produce symbolic expressions for quantities of interest with reasonable computational effort and they can be used to explore the interplay between interaction topology and molecular noise in a broader class of biochemical networks We provide code implementing these methods View details for DOI View details for Web of Science ID 000291015800010

Abstract Critical developmental control genes sometimes contain shadow enhancers that can be located in remote positions including the introns of neighboring genes 1 They nonetheless produce patterns of gene expression that are the same as or similar to those produced by more proximal primary enhancers It was suggested that shadow enhancers help foster robustness in gene expression in response to environmental or genetic perturbations 2 3 We critically tested this hypothesis by employing a combination of bacterial artificial chromosome BAC recombineering and quantitative confocal imaging methods 2 4 Evidence is presented that the snail gene is regulated by a distal shadow enhancer located within a neighboring locus Removal of the proximal primary enhancer does not significantly perturb snail function including the repression of neurogenic genes and formation of the ventral furrow during gastrulation at normal temperatures However at elevated temperatures there is sporadic loss of snail expression and coincident disruptions in gastrulation Similar defects are observed at normal temperatures upon reductions in the levels of Dorsal a key activator of snail expression reviewed in 5 These results suggest that shadow enhancers represent a novel mechanism of canalization whereby complex developmental processes bring about one definite regardless of minor variations in

to the complexity of living systems Provocative computational explorations have shown that similarly complex patterns may arise from the collective interaction of a small number of rules This suggests that although a system may appear complex it may still be understood in terms of simple principles It is still debatable whether shell patterns emerge from some undiscovered simple principles or are the consequence of an irreducibly complex interaction of many effects Recent work by Boettiger Ermentrout and Oster on the biological mechanisms of shell patterning has provided compelling evidence

Activation in the Drosophila Embryo SCIENCE Boettiger Levine 2009 325 5939 Abstract Drosophila embryogenesis is characterized by rapid transitions in gene activity whereby crudely distributed gradients of regulatory proteins give way to precise patterns of gene expression To explore the underlying mechanisms a partially automated quantitative in situ hybridization method was used to visualize expression profiles of 14 developmental control genes in hundreds of embryos These studies revealed two distinct patterns of gene activation synchronous and stochastic Synchronous genes display essentially uniform expression of nascent transcripts in all cells of an embryonic tissue whereas stochastic genes display erratic patterns of de novo activation RNA polymerase II is stalled in the promoter regions of synchronous genes but not stochastic genes Transcriptional synchrony might ensure the orderly deployment of the complex gene regulatory networks that control embryogenesis

the early Drosophila embryo depends on Dorsal a maternal transcription factor related to mammalian Dorsal controls DV patterning through the differential regulation of approximately 50 target genes in a manner methods including and assays have identified approximately 100 Dorsal target enhancers and more than of these have been experimentally confirmed via transgenic embryo assays Despite differences in DV patterning among divergent insects a number of the Dorsal target enhancers are located in conserved positions relative to the associated transcription units Thus the evolution of novel patterns of gene expression might depend on the modification of old enhancers rather than the invention of new ones As many as half of all Dorsal target genes appear to contain shadow enhancers a second enhancer that directs the same or similar expression pattern as the primary enhancer Preliminary studies suggest that shadow enhancers might help to ensure resilience of gene expression in response to environmental and genetic perturbations Finally most Dorsal target genes appear to contain RNA polymerase II pol II prior to their activation Stalled pol II fosters synchronous patterns of gene activation in the early embryo In contrast DV patterning genes lacking stalled pol II are initially activated in an erratic or stochastic fashion It is possible that stalled pol II confers

PMC4280271 Nuclear trapping shapes the terminal gradient in the Drosophila embryo CURRENT BIOLOGY Coppey Boettiger Berezhkovskii Shvartsman Y 2008 18 12 Abstract Patterning of the terminal regions of the Drosophila embryo relies on the gradient of phosphorylated dpERK which is controlled by the localized activation of the Torso receptor tyrosine kinase This model is supported by a large amount of data but the gradient itself has never been quantified We present the first measurements of the dpERK gradient and establish a new intracellular layer of its regulation Based on the quantitative analysis of the spatial pattern of dpERK in mutants with different levels of Torso as well as the dynamics of the dpERK pattern we propose that the gradient is controlled by a cascade of modules A mechanism establishes a sharply localized pattern of the Torso receptor occupancy on the surface of the embryo Inside the syncytial embryo nuclei play the role of traps that localize diffusible dpERK We argue that the length scale of the gradient is determined mainly by the intracellular module View details for DOI View details for Web of Science ID 000257151900032 View details for PubMedID

gradient had always been interpreted within the framework of the localized production diffusion and degradation model We propose an alternative mechanism which assumes no Bicoid degradation The medium where the Bicoid gradient is formed and interpreted is very dynamic Most notably the number of nuclei changes over three orders of magnitude from fertilization when Bicoid synthesis is initiated to nuclear cycle 14 when most of the measurements were taken We demonstrate that a model based on Bicoid diffusion and nucleocytoplasmic shuttling in the presence of the growing number of nuclei can account for most of the properties of the Bicoid concentration profile Consistent with experimental observations the Bicoid gradient in our model is established before nuclei migrate to the periphery of the embryo and remains stable during subsequent nuclear divisions View details for DOI View details for Web of Science ID 000251734300013 View details for PubMedID 18001703 View details for

Coordinated cell movements in epithelial layers are essential for proper tissue morphogenesis and homeostasis but our understanding of the mechanisms that coordinate the behavior of multiple cells in these processes is far from complete Recent experiments with canine kidney epithelial monolayers revealed a pattern of MAPK activation and showed that it is essential for collective cell migration after wounding To investigate the effects of the different aspects of wounding on cell sheet migration we engineered a system that allowed us to dissect the classic wound healing assay We studied canine kidney sheet migration under three different conditions 1 the classic wound healing assay 2 empty space induction where a confluent monolayer is grown adjacent to a slab of polydimethylsiloxane and the monolayer is not injured but allowed to migrate upon removal of the slab and 3 injury via polydimethylsiloxane membrane where an injured monolayer migrates onto plain tissue culture surface as in the case of empty space induction allowing for direct comparison By tracking the motion of individual cells within the sheet under these three conditions we show how the dynamics of the individual cells motion is responsible for the coordinated migration of the sheet and is coordinated with the activation of MAPK In addition we demonstrate that the propagation of the waves of MAPK activation depends on the generation of reactive oxygen species at the wound edge View details for DOI View details for Web of Science ID 000238287500009 View details for PubMedID 16495370 Report Accessibility
