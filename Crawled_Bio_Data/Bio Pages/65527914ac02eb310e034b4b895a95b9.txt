neurosurgery Few small series with limited have reported relatively high rates of contralateral stenosis To review our large series of unilateral MMD patients and evaluate radiographic and surgical progression rates and identify any factors associated with We included all unilateral MMD cases treated from 1991 to 2017 in an observational study We examined time to contralateral radiographic progression and contralateral progression requiring surgery Using Cox regression analysis we evaluated factors potentially associated with contralateral There were 217 patients treated for unilateral MMD About 71 were female and the average age at first surgery was Average was yr range yr A total of 18 patients developed contralateral progression And 8 of these developed progression requiring bypass surgery Baseline stenosis and hyperlipidemia HLD were significantly associated with radiographic progression hazard ratio HR Baseline stenosis was associated with surgical progression Results were similar when controlling for possible confounders using multivariate Previous series showed relatively high rates of progression in unilateral MMD 15 but these studies were small and was rarely available Our large series indicates that the rate of progression is lower than previously reported but still warrants yearly noninvasive screening These data may provide indirect support for statin

Marks Steinberg 2020 Abstract OBJECTIVE Perforator arteries the absence of an aneurysm discrete neck and the nature of posterior circulation fusiform aneurysms present treatment challenges There have been advances in microsurgical and endovascular approaches including flow diversion and the authors sought to review these treatments in a series at their neurovascular referral The authors performed a retrospective chart review from 1990 to 2018 Primary outcomes were modified Rankin Scale mRS scores and Glasgow Outcome Scale GOS scores at The authors also examined neurological complication rates Using regression techniques they reviewed independent and dependent variables including presenting features aneurysm location and size surgical approach and pretreatment and posttreatment patients met the inclusion criteria Their mean age was 53 years and 49 58 were female 49 patients presented with subarachnoid hemorrhage Aneurysms were located on the vertebral artery VA or posterior inferior cerebellar artery PICA in 50 60 patients basilar artery BA or vertebrobasilar junction VBJ in 22 26 and posterior cerebral artery PCA in 12 14 37 patients were treated with microsurgical and 53 63 with endovascular approaches Six aneurysms were treated with endovascular flow diversion The authors found moderate disability or better mRS score 3 in 85 of the patients at a mean The GOS score was 4 in 82 of the patients The overall neurological complication rate was 12 In the regression analysis patients with VA or PICA aneurysms had better functional outcomes than the other groups p Endovascular strategies were associated with better outcomes for aneurysms p but microsurgery was associated with better outcomes for and PCA aneurysms p There were no other significant associations between patient aneurysm characteristics or treatment features and neurological complications p Patients treated with flow diversion had more complications than those who underwent other endovascular and microsurgical strategies but the difference was not significant in regression Posterior circulation fusiform aneurysms remain a challenging aneurysm subtype but an interdisciplinary treatment approach can result in good outcomes While flow diversion is a useful addition to the armamentarium traditional endovascular and microsurgical techniques continue to offer effective options View

results of an individualized selection strategy Journal of neurosurgery Nielsen Abhinav Sussman Han Weng Heit Steinberg 2020 Abstract The only effective treatment for ischemic moyamoya disease iMMD is cerebral revascularization by an extracranial to intracranial bypass The preferred revascularization method remains controversial direct versus indirect bypass The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that method choice should be personalized based on angiographic hemodynamic and clinical characteristics to balance the risk of perioperative major stroke against treatment with iMMD were identified retrospectively from a prospectively maintained database Those with mild to moderate internal carotid artery or M1 segment stenosis preserved cerebrovascular reserve intraoperative M4 segment anterograde flow 8 or the absence of frequent and severe transient ischemic attacks TIAs or stroke had been assigned to indirect bypass The criteria for direct bypass were severe ICA or M1 segment stenosis or occlusion impaired cerebrovascular reserve or steal phenomenon intraoperative M4 segment retrograde flow or anterograde flow 8 and the presence of frequent and severe TIAs or clinical strokes The primary study endpoint was symptomatic stroke 7 days postoperatively resulting in a decline in the modified Rankin Scale mRS score from preoperatively to 6 months postoperatively As a secondary endpoint the authors assessed postoperative revascularization which was classified as or of the middle cerebral artery hundred patients with iMMD affecting 195 hemispheres revascularized in the period from March 2016 to June 2018 were included in this analysis One hundred hemispheres were revascularized with direct bypass and 62 with indirect bypass The perioperative stroke rate was and in the direct and indirect groups respectively p Degree of revascularization was higher in the direct bypass group p The proportion of patients improving to an mRS score from preoperatively to 6 months postoperatively tended to be higher in the direct bypass group although the difference between the two bypass groups was not statistically significant p selective use of an indirect bypass procedure for iMMD did not decrease the perioperative stroke rate Direct bypass provided a significantly higher degree of revascularization The authors conclude that direct bypass is the treatment of choice for iMMD View details for DOI View details for PubMedID 32534489 Terminalis Approach to Resection of Cavernous Malformation World neurosurgery Bigder Li Mandel Steinberg 2020 Abstract Cavernous malformations of the midbrain require careful consideration of the risks and benefits of intervention as well as optimal surgical approach for these challenging lesions Excellent results can be achieved with careful surgical planning and In this operative video we demonstrate a contralateral left pterional craniotomy for terminalis approach to CO2 microsurgical resection of a cavernoma in a 59 year old female presenting with progressive debilitating diplopia secondary to partial third nerve palsy We utilized a contralateral left modified pterional craniotomy in which we limit dissection of the temporalis muscle to approximately one third rather than extending the muscle split down to the zygoma The cavernous malformation was resected without complication and the patient was discharged from hospital on Day 3 She noted immediate improvement and nearly complete resolution of her symptoms over ensuing weeks This approach offers a direct route to the lesion with minimal brain transgression while avoiding the critical structures within the interpeduncular cistern including basilar artery and perforating arteries as well as bordering neural structures including cerebral peduncles oculomotor nerves and mamillary bodies Use of the CO2 laser with its tip offers a low surgical profile and allows for precise cutting thus minimizing thermal damage to surrounding tissues The terminalis approach through a pterional craniotomy offers a safe and potentially less morbid alternative to select lesions compared to exposure through the mesencephalic surface which in our experience often necessitates an orbitozygomatic craniotomy View details for DOI View details for PubMedID 32360676 Incidental De Novo Cerebral Microhemorrhages are Predictive of Future

de novo CMHs and assess its correlation with repeat hemorrhage rates and functional outcome in hemorrhagic onset moyamoya disease HOMMD retrospectively reviewed a prospectively managed departmental database of all patients presenting with HOMMD treated between 1987 and 2019 The search yielded 121 patients with adequate MRI for inclusion into the total 42 preoperative CMHs were identified in 18 patients 15 Patients presenting with preoperative CMH were more likely to develop de novo CMH after surgical revascularization 7 de novo CHMs were identified in 6 patients 5 on routine postoperative MRI at distinct locations from previous sites of hemorrhage or CMH Symptomatic repeat macro hemorrhage was confirmed radiographically in 15 patients 12 A total 5 83 of 6 patients with de novo CMHs later suffered symptomatic repeat macro hemorrhage with 4 of 5 80 hemorrhages occurring at sites of previous CMH On univariate and multivariate analysis de novo CMHs was the only significant variable predictive for developing repeat symptomatic hemorrhage Development of delayed repeat symptomatic hemorrhage was prognostic for higher modified Rankin Score and therefore poorer functional status whereas preoperative functional status was predictive of final novo CMHs after surgical revascularization might serve as a radiographic biomarker for refractory disease and suggest patients are at

and treatment outcomes Journal of neurosurgery Madhugiri Teo Vavao Steinberg 2017 Abstract OBJECTIVE Brainstem arteriovenous malformations AVMs are rare lesions that are difficult to diagnose and treat They are often more aggressive in their behavior when compared with their supratentorial counterparts The consequence of a brainstem hemorrhage is often devastating and many patients are in poor neurological status at presentation The authors examine the factors associated with angiographically confirmed cure and those affecting management outcomes for these complex lesions METHODS This was a retrospective analysis of data gathered from the prospectively maintained Stanford AVM database Lesions were grouped based on their location in the brainstem medulla pons or midbrain and the quadrant they occupied Angiographic cure was dichotomized as completely obliterated or not and functional outcome was dichotomized as either independent or not independent at last RESULTS Over a period 39 lesions were treated Of these 3 were located in the medulla 14 in the pons and 22 in the midbrain At presentation 92 of the patients had hemorrhage and only were functionally independent Surgery resulted in the best radiographic cure rates with a morbidity rate of In all 53 of patients either improved or remained stable after surgery Absence of residual nidus and female sex correlated with

Aswendt Steinberg 2016 13 2 Abstract Stroke is a leading cause of death and disability in the USA yet treatment options are very limited Functional recovery can occur after stroke and is attributed in part to rewiring of neural connections in areas adjacent to or remotely connected to the infarct A better understanding of neural circuit rewiring is thus an important step toward developing future therapeutic strategies for stroke recovery Because stroke disrupts functional connections in and remotely connected regions it is important to investigate network dynamics during recovery Optogenetics is a revolutionary neuroscience tool that uses bioengineered proteins to selectively activate or inhibit specific cell types and neural circuits within milliseconds allowing greater specificity and temporal precision for dissecting neural circuit mechanisms in diseases In this review we discuss the current view of remapping and recovery including recent studies that use optogenetics to investigate neural circuit remapping after stroke as well as optogenetic stimulation to enhance stroke recovery Multimodal approaches employing optogenetics in conjunction with other readouts in vivo neuroimaging techniques behavior assays and sequencing will advance our understanding of neural circuit reorganization during recovery as well as provide important insights into which brain circuits

Steinberg 2016 139 Abstract Ischaemic stroke is the leading cause of severe disability yet lacks drug therapies that promote the repair phase of recovery This repair phase of stroke occurs days to months after stroke onset and involves brain remapping and plasticity within the zone Elucidating mechanisms that promote this plasticity is critical for the development of new therapeutics with a broad treatment window Inhibiting tonic extrasynaptic GABA signalling during the repair phase was reported to enhance functional recovery in mice suggesting that GABA plays an important function in modulating brain repair While tonic GABA appears to suppress brain repair after stroke less is known about the role of phasic synaptic GABA during the repair phase We observed an increase in postsynaptic phasic GABA signalling in mice within the cortex specific to layer 5 we found increased numbers of α1 receptor GABAergic synapses detected using array tomography and an associated increased efficacy of spontaneous and miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents in pyramidal neurons Furthermore we demonstrate that enhancing phasic GABA signalling using zolpidem a Food and Drug Administration FDA allosteric modulator during the repair phase improved behavioural recovery These data identify potentiation of phasic GABA signalling as a novel therapeutic strategy indicate

Neuron George Steinberg 2015 87 2 Abstract Stroke remains a leading cause of death and disability in the world Over the past few decades our understanding of the pathophysiology of stroke has increased but greater insight is required to advance the field of stroke recovery Clinical treatments have improved in the acute time window but therapeutics remain limited Complex neural circuits damaged by ischemia make restoration of function after stroke difficult New therapeutic approaches including cell transplantation or stimulation focus on reestablishing these circuits through multiple mechanisms to improve circuit plasticity and remodeling Other research targets intact networks to compensate for damaged regions This review highlights several important mechanisms of stroke injury

after bypass for moyamoya disease JOURNAL OF NEUROSURGERY Mukerji Cook Steinberg 2015 122 1 Abstract Hyperperfusion is believed to be the cause of transient neurological events TNEs in patients with moyamoya disease MMD who have undergone an bypass between the superficial temporal artery STA and the middle cerebral artery MCA The objective of this study was to evaluate this possibility by analyzing cerebral blood flow CBF data obtained with thermal diffusion probes used at the authors authors examined postoperative cerebral perfusion in 31 patients with MMD who underwent a direct bypass A Hemedex Q500 flow probe was placed in the frontal lobe adjacent to the bypass and connected to a Bowman cerebral perfusion monitor and CBF data were statistically analyzed using JMP software Seven patients experienced a TNE after surgery in the left hemisphere that is after surgery manifesting as dysphasia approximately 24 hours postoperatively and which had improved by 48 hours No TNEs were observed after surgeries Operative and postoperative CBFs in the left side with the TNE were compared with those in the left side with no TNE and on the right detailed analysis of flow observations showed that the initial postbypass CBF was higher on the left side where the TNEs occurred This CBF increase was followed by a widely fluctuating pattern and a statistically significant and sharp drop in perfusion p mean difference of CBF between groups paired associated with a TNE not observed in the other 2 the basis of the authors initial observations an altered pattern of CBF was identified These findings suggest local hypoperfusion as the cause of the TNEs This hypoperfusion may originate from competing blood flows resulting from impaired cerebral autoregulation and a fluctuating flow in cerebral microcirculation View details for DOI View details for Web of Science ID 000346947600011 View details for PubMedID 25343178 Disease Variant Landscape of a Large Multiethnic Population of Moyamoya Patients by Exome Sequencing G3 Bethesda Md Shoemaker Clark Patwardhan Chandratillake Garcia Chen Morgan A Leng Kirk Chen Cook Snyder Steinberg 2015 6 1 Abstract Moyamoya disease MMD is a rare disorder characterized by cerebrovascular occlusion and development of collateral vessels Approximately of cases are familial with a presumed low penetrance autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance Diagnosis commonly occurs only after clinical presentation The recent identification of the RNF213 founder mutation in the Asian population has made a significant contribution but the etiology of this disease remains unclear To further develop the variant landscape of MMD we performed whole exome sequencing of 125 unrelated predominantly nonfamilial ethnically diverse MMD patients in parallel with 125 internally sequenced matched controls using the same exome and analysis platform Three subpopulations were established Asian Caucasian and founder mutation cases We provided additional support for the previously observed RNF213 founder mutation in Asian cases P that was enriched among East Asians compared to Southeast Asian and Pacific Islander cases P and was absent in all Caucasian cases The most enriched variant in Caucasian P and founder mutation P cases was ZXDC a gene involved in MHC Class II activation Collapsing variant methodology ranked OBSCN a gene involved in myofibrillogenesis as most enriched in Caucasian P and founder mutation cases P These findings further support the East Asian origins of the RNF213 variant and more fully describe the genetic landscape of multiethnic MMD revealing novel alternative candidate variants and genes that may be important in MMD etiology and diagnosis View details for DOI View details for

Lee Arac Fenno Deisseroth Steinberg 2014 111 35 Abstract Clinical and research efforts have focused on promoting functional recovery after stroke Brain stimulation strategies are particularly promising because they allow direct manipulation of the target area excitability However elucidating the cell type and mechanisms mediating recovery has been difficult because existing stimulation techniques nonspecifically target all cell types near the stimulated site To circumvent these barriers we used optogenetics to selectively activate neurons that express channelrhodopsin 2 and demonstrated that selective neuronal stimulations in the ipsilesional primary motor cortex iM1 can promote functional recovery Stroke mice that received repeated neuronal stimulations exhibited significant improvement in cerebral blood flow and the neurovascular coupling response as well as increased expression of neurotrophins in the contralesional cortex including neurotrophic factor nerve growth factor and neurotrophin 3 Western analysis also indicated that stimulated mice exhibited a significant increase in the expression of a plasticity marker protein 43 Moreover iM1 neuronal stimulations promoted functional recovery as stimulated stroke mice showed faster weight gain and performed significantly better in behavior tests Interestingly stimulations in normal nonstroke mice did not alter motor behavior or neurotrophin expression suggesting that the prorecovery effect of selective neuronal stimulations is dependent on the poststroke environment These results demonstrate that stimulation of neurons in the stroke hemisphere is sufficient to promote recovery View details for DOI View details for Web of Science ID 000341230800084 View details for PubMedCentralID

method of harvesting an omental flap that preserves its gastroepiploic arterial pedicled omentum can be lengthened as needed by dividing it between the vascular arcades It is transposed to the brain via skip incisions The flap can be trimmed or stretched to cover ischemic areas of the brain The cranial exposure is performed in parallel with pediatric surgeons We performed this technique in 3 pediatric moyamoya patients aged 5 to 12 years with prior bypasses and progressive ischemic symptoms In 1 patient we transposed omentum to both loss ranged from 75 to 250 ml After surgery patients

variations in size S location in eloquent cortex E and presence of central venous drainage V Because they may have implications for management and outcome the authors evaluated these variations in the present 1984 and 2010 100 patients with Grade III AVMs were treated The AVMs were categorized by characteristics as follows Type 1 S1E1V1 Type 2 S2E1V0 Type 3 S2E0V1 and Type 4 S3E0V0 The occurrence of a new neurological deficit functional status based on modified Rankin Scale mRS score at discharge and and radiological obliteration were correlated with demographic and morphological hundred

whether a noninvasive imaging modality arterial spin labeling ASL MRI could be used to detect the presence and intensity of collateral flow using digital subtraction angiography DSA and stable xenon CT cerebral blood flow as gold standards for collaterals and cerebral blood flow and DSA were obtained within 4 days of each other in 18 patients with Moyamoya disease Two neurointerventionalists scored DSA images using a collateral grading scale in regions of interest corresponding to ASPECTS methodology Two neuroradiologists similarly scored ASL images based on the presence of arterial transit artifact Agreement of ASL and DSA consensus scores was determined including kappa statistics In 15 patients additional quantitative xenon CT cerebral blood flow measurements were performed and compared with collateral agreement between ASL and DSA consensus readings was moderate to strong with a weighted kappa value of 95 confidence interval but there was better agreement between readers for ASL compared with DSA Sensitivity and specificity for identifying collaterals with ASL were 95 confidence interval and 95 confidence interval respectively Xenon CT cerebral blood flow increased

transport in the ischaemic brain BRAIN Andres Horie Slikker Zhan Sun Manley Pereira Sheikh McMillan Schaar Svendsen Bliss Steinberg 2011 134 Abstract Stem cell transplantation promises new hope for the treatment of stroke although significant questions remain about how the grafted cells elicit their effects One hypothesis is that transplanted stem cells enhance endogenous repair mechanisms activated after cerebral ischaemia Recognizing that bilateral reorganization of surviving circuits is associated with recovery after stroke we investigated the ability of transplanted human neural progenitor cells to enhance this structural plasticity Our results show the first evidence that human neural progenitor cell treatment can significantly increase dendritic plasticity in both the and contralesional cortex and this coincides with stem functional recovery Moreover stem rats demonstrated increased corticocortical corticostriatal corticothalamic and corticospinal axonal rewiring from the contralesional side with the transcallosal and corticospinal axonal sprouting correlating with functional recovery Furthermore we demonstrate that axonal transport which is critical for both proper axonal function and axonal sprouting is inhibited by stroke and that this is rescued by the stem cell treatment thus identifying another novel potential mechanism of action of transplanted cells Finally we established in vitro assays in which these stem cells mimicked the effects observed in vivo Through immunodepletion studies we identified vascular endothelial growth factor thrombospondins 1 and 2 and slit as mediators partially responsible for stem effects on dendritic sprouting axonal plasticity and axonal transport in vitro Thus we postulate that human neural progenitor cells aid recovery after stroke through secretion of factors that enhance brain repair and plasticity View details for DOI View details for Web of Science ID 000291063900018 View details

Inflammation and Vascular Repair Stem cells Dayton Ohio Horie Pereira Niizuma Sun Encarnacion Shamloo Hamilton Jiang Huhn Palmer Bliss Steinberg 2011 Abstract Cell transplantation offers a novel therapeutic strategy for stroke however how transplanted cells function in vivo is poorly understood We show for the first time that after transplantation into the ischemic brain of human central nervous system stem cells grown as neurospheres the stem factor human VEGF hVEGF is necessary for functional recovery We correlate this functional recovery to effects on the host brain including multiple facets of vascular repair and its unexpected suppression of the inflammatory response We found that transplanted affected multiple parameters in the brain with different kinetics early improvement in barrier BBB integrity and suppression of inflammation was followed by a delayed regulated increase in neovascularization These events coincided with a pattern of functional recovery an early recovery independent of neovascularization and a delayed recovery coincident with neovascularization Therefore cell transplantation therapy offers an exciting strategy for brain repair in stroke

vasodilation with a deep learning network by using only images before acetazolamide administration Materials and Methods Simultaneous oxygen 15 15O water before and after acetazolamide injection were retrospectively analyzed for patients with Moyamoya disease and healthy control participants from April 2017 to May 2019 Inputs to deep learning models were images arterial spin labeling ASL structural scans T2 T1 and brain location Two models that is water PET cerebral blood flow CBF and MRI model before acetazolamide administration and only MRI model before acetazolamide administration

analysis included image quality metrics peak ratio root mean square error and structural similarity index as well as comparison between the various methods by using correlation and analyses Identification of vascular territories with impaired rDeltaCBF was evaluated by using receiver operating characteristic metrics Results participants were included 24 patients with Moyamoya disease mean age standard deviation 41 years 12 17 women and 12 healthy control participants mean age 39 years 16 nine women The rDeltaCBF maps predicted by both deep learning models demonstrated better image

oxide synthase nNOS has been implicated as a key regulator of the neurovascular response in acute stroke however its role in subacute recovery remains unclear We investigated the expression of nNOS in stroke mice undergoing optogenetic stimulation of the contralesional lateral cerebellar nucleus cLCN We also examined the effects of nNOS inhibition on functional recovery using a pharmacological inhibitor targeting nNOS Optogenetically stimulated stroke mice demonstrated significant improvement on the horizontal rotating beam task at days 10 and nNOS mRNA and protein expression was significantly and selectively decreased in the contralesional primary motor cortex cM1 of mice The nNOS expression in cM1 was negatively correlated with improved recovery nNOS inhibitor ARL 17477 stroke mice exhibited a significant functional improvement in speed at day 10 when compared to stroke mice receiving vehicle saline only Our results show that optogenetic stimulation of cLCN and

Cavernous malformations CMs are commonly treated cerebrovascular anomalies in the pediatric population however the data on radiographic recurrence of pediatric CMs after surgery are limited The authors aimed to study the clinical presentation outcomes and recurrence rate following surgery for a large cohort of CMs in patients 18 years old who had a CM resected at a single institution were identified and retrospectively reviewed Fisher exact test of independence was used to assess differences in categorical variables Survival curves were evaluated using the patients aged 3 months to 18 years underwent resection of 74 symptomatic CMs between 1996 and 2018 at a single institution The median length of was years Patients most commonly presented with seizures n 24 and the majority of CMs were cortical n 43 Acute radiographic hemorrhage was common at presentation n 34 percent n 22 of patients presented with multiple CMs and they were more likely to develop de novo lesions 71 compared to patients presenting with a single CM Both radiographic hemorrhage and multiple CMs were independently prognostic for a higher risk of the patient requiring subsequent surgery Fifty percent n 6 of the 12 patients with both risk factors required additional surgery within years of initial surgery compared to none of the patients with neither risk factor n 9 with either acute radiographic hemorrhage or multiple CMs are at higher risk for subsequent surgery and require MRI surveillance In contrast patients with a single CM are unlikely to require additional surgery and may require less

in the Secondary Thalamic Injury After Cortical Ischemic Stroke Frontiers in neurology Cao Harvey Bliss Cheng Steinberg 2020 11 236 Abstract Stroke is one of the major causes of chronic disability worldwide and increasing efforts have focused on studying brain repair and recovery after stroke Following stroke the primary injury site can disrupt functional connections in nearby and remotely connected brain regions resulting in the development of secondary injuries that may impede functional recovery In particular secondary degenerative injury occurs in the connected ipsilesional thalamus following a cortical stroke Although secondary thalamic injury was first described decades ago the underlying mechanisms still remain unclear We performed a systematic literature review using the NCBI PubMed database for studies that focused on the secondary thalamic degeneration after cortical ischemic stroke In this review we discussed emerging studies that characterized the pathological changes in the secondary degenerative thalamus after stroke these included excitotoxicity apoptosis amyloid beta protein accumulation breakdown and inflammatory responses In particular we highlighted key findings of the dynamic inflammatory responses in the secondary thalamic injury and discussed the involvement of several cell types in this process We also discussed studies that investigated the effects of blocking secondary thalamic injury on inflammatory responses and stroke outcome Targeting secondary injuries after stroke may alleviate deficits and ultimately promote stroke recovery View

Journal of neurointerventional surgery Pulli Sussman Mayercik Steinberg Do Heit J 2020 Abstract Precise delivery of liquid embolic agents LEAs remains a challenge in the endovascular treatment of dural arteriovenous fistulae dAVFs and cerebral arteriovenous malformations cAVMs Despite significant advances in the past decade LEA reflux and catheter navigability remain shortcomings of current endovascular technology particularly in small and tortuous arteries The Scepter Mini balloon microcatheter aims to address these issues by decreasing the distal catheter profile French while allowing for a small mm diameter balloon at its report our initial experience with the Scepter Mini in two patients with anterior cranial fossa dAVFs that were treated with transophthalmic artery both patients the Scepter Mini catheter was able to be safely advanced into the distal ophthalmic artery close to the fistula site and several centimeters past the origins of the central retinal and posterior ciliary arteries A single Onyx injection without any reflux resulted in angiographic cure of the dAVF in both cases and neither patient suffered any vision initial experiences suggest that the Scepter Mini represents a significant advance in the endovascular treatment of dAVFs and cAVMs and will allow for safer and more efficacious delivery of LEAs into smaller and more distal arteries while

acute vascular occlusion following revascularization surgery for moyamoya disease JOURNAL OF NEUROSURGERY Sussman Madhugiri Teo Nielsen Furtado Pendharkar Ho Esparza Azad Zhang Steinberg 2019 131 6 Abstract OBJECTIVERevascularization surgery is a safe and effective surgical treatment for symptomatic moyamoya disease MMD and has been shown to reduce the frequency of future ischemic events and improve quality of life in affected patients The authors sought to investigate the occurrence of acute perioperative occlusion of the contralateral internal carotid artery ICA with contralateral stroke following revascularization surgery a rare complication that has not been previously study is a retrospective review of a prospective database of a single surgeon series of revascularization operations in patients with MMD From 1991 to 2016 1446 bypasses were performed in 905 patients of which involved direct anastomosis of the superficial temporal artery STA to a distal branch of the middle cerebral artery MCA Demographic surgical and radiographic data were collected prospectively in all treated contralateral hemispheric infarcts occurred during the postoperative period in 34 cases Digital subtraction angiography DSA was performed in each of these patients In 8 cases DSA during the immediate postoperative period revealed associated new occlusion of the contralateral ICA In each of these cases revascularization surgery involved direct anastomosis of the STA to an M4 branch of the MCA Preoperative DSA revealed moderate n 1 or severe n 3 stenosis or occlusion n 4 of the ipsilateral ICA and mild n 2 moderate n 4 or severe n 2 stenosis of the contralateral ICA The baseline Suzuki stage was 4 n 7 or 5 n 1 The collateral supply originated exclusively from the intracranial circulation in patients 50 and from both the intracranial and extracranial circulation in the remaining 50 of patients Seven 88 of 8 patients improved symptomatically during the acute postoperative period with induced hypertension The modified Rankin Scale mRS score at discharge was worse than baseline in patients 88 whereas 1 patient had only minor deficits that did not affect the mRS score At the patients 38 were at their baseline mRS score or better 1 patient had significant disability compared with preoperatively 2 patients had died and 1 patient was lost to is not yet available in 1 occlusion of the ICA on the contralateral side from an bypass is a rare but potentially serious complication of revascularization surgery for MMD It highlights the importance of the hemodynamic interrelationships that exist between the two hemispheres a concept that has been previously underappreciated Induced hypertension during the acute period may provide adequate cerebral blood flow via developing collateral vessels and good outcomes may be achieved with aggressive supportive management and expedited contralateral revascularization View details for DOI View details for

with subsequent cognitive impairment In adults with moyamoya apparent diffusion coefficient ADC is correlated with regions of steal phenomenon and executive dysfunction prior to white matter To investigate quantitative global diffusion changes in pediatric moyamoya patients prior to explicit structural ischemic We retrospectively reviewed children 20 yr old with moyamoya disease and syndrome who underwent bypass surgery at our institution We identified 29 children with normal structural preoperative MRI and without findings of cortical infarction or chronic white matter ischemic changes DWI datasets were used to calculate ADC maps for each subject as well as for 60 healthy controls Using an approach the cerebral white matter cerebral cortex thalamus caudate putamen pallidum hippocampus amygdala nucleus accumbens and brainstem were segmented in each DWI dataset and used to calculate regional volumes and ADC Multivariate analysis of covariance using the regional ADC and volume values as dependent variables and age and gender as covariates revealed a significant difference between the groups P Post hoc analysis demonstrated significantly elevated ADC values for children with moyamoya in the cerebral cortex white matter caudate putamen and nucleus accumbens No significant volume differences were Prior to having bypass surgery and in the absence of imaging evidence of ischemic stroke children with moyamoya exhibit cerebral diffusion changes These findings could reflect microstructural changes stemming from exhaustion of cerebrovascular reserve View

during was less frequent in patients who underwent a surgical intervention compared to of the conservatively treated patients pooled OR 95 CI In addition we observed a difference in mortality pooled OR 95 CI but did not identify an association between surgical treatment and ischemic stroke pooled OR 95 CI Surgical intervention in MMD is associated with a decreased risk of stroke most striking in patients presenting with hemorrhagic MMD The relationship was present between surgical treatment and the outcome of hemorrhagic but not ischemic stroke View details for DOI View details for PubMedID

Hayes Steinberg Wintermark 2019 Abstract Blood biomarker tests were recently approved for clinical diagnosis of traumatic brain injury TBI yet there are still fundamental questions which need attention One such question is the stability of putative biomarkers in blood over the course of several days after injury if the sample is unable to be processed into serum or plasma and stored at low temperatures Blood may not be able to be stored at temperatures in austere combat or sports environments In this prospective study of 20 adult patients with positive head computed tomography imaging findings the stability of three biomarkers glial fibrillary acidic protein GFAP ubiquitin and S100B in whole blood and in serum stored at was evaluated over the course of 72 hours after blood collection The amount of time whole blood and serum were refrigerated had no significant effect on GFAP concentration in plasma obtained from whole blood and in serum and respectively concentration in plasma obtained from whole blood and in serum and respectively and S100B concentration in serum Concentration levels of GFAP and S100B in blood collected from patients with TBI were found to be stable at for at least 3 days after blood draw This study suggests that the levels of the three diagnostic markers above are still valid for diagnostic TBI tests if the sample is stored in refrigerated

STROKEAHA118023426 Abstract Background and Noninvasive imaging of brain perfusion has the potential to elucidate pathophysiological mechanisms underlying Moyamoya disease and enable clinical imaging of cerebral blood flow CBF to select revascularization therapies for patients We used hybrid positron emission tomography PET resonance imaging MRI technology to characterize the distribution of hypoperfusion in Moyamoya disease and its relationship to vessel stenosis severity through comparisons with a normative perfusion database of healthy controls To image CBF we acquired 15O PET as a reference and simultaneously acquired arterial spin labeling ASL MRI scans in 20 Moyamoya patients and 15 healthy controls on a scanner The ASL MRI scans included a standard ASL scan with postlabel delay of s and a multidelay scan with 5 postlabel delays to estimate and account for arterial transit time in CBF quantification The percent volume of hypoperfusion in patients determined as the fifth percentile of CBF values in the healthy control database was the outcome measure in a logistic regression model that included stenosis grade and location Logistic regression showed that anterior P and middle cerebral artery territory regions in Moyamoya patients were susceptible to hypoperfusion whereas posterior regions were not Cortical regions supplied by arteries with stenosis on MR angiography showed more hypoperfusion than normal arteries but the extent of hypoperfusion was not different between versus severe stenosis Multidelay ASL did not perform differently from 15O PET in detecting perfusion abnormalities but standard ASL overestimated the extent of hypoperfusion in patients This simultaneous study supports the use of multidelay ASL MRI in clinical evaluation of Moyamoya disease

CBF However this technique requires an arterial input function measured through continuous sampling of arterial blood which is invasive and has limitations with tracer delay and demonstrate a new noninvasive method to quantify absolute CBF with a hybrid scanner This approach called takes the spatial CBF distribution from a static H215 scan and scales it to the average CBF value measured by simultaneous healthy controls HC and 13 patients with Moyamoya disease MM as a model of chronic ischemic MRI and H215 CBF values from whole brain WB gray matter GM and white matter WM in HCs were compared with literature values since 2000 CBF and cerebrovascular reactivity CVR which is defined as the percent CBF change between baseline and vasodilator scans were measured by in MM patients and HCs within cortical regions corresponding to major vascular territories Statistical Tests Linear mixed effects models were created to compare CBF and CVR respectively between patients and controls and between different degrees of mean CBF values in WB GM and WM in HC were 42 7 50 7 and 23 3 respectively which agree well with literature values Compared with normal regions 57 23 patients showed significantly decreased CVR in areas with stenosis 47 17 P and in areas 40 16 P Data Conclusion identifies differences in cerebrovascular reactivity between healthy controls and cerebrovascular

Abstract INTRODUCTION Since Lars Leksell developed the first stereotactic radiosurgery SRS device in 1951 there has been growth in the technologies available and clinical indications for SRS This expansion has been reflected in the medical literature which is built upon key articles and institutions that have significantly impacted SRS applications Our aim was to identify these prominent works and provide an educational tool for training and further A list of search phrases relating to central nervous system applications of stereotactic radiosurgery was compiled A topic search was performed using PubMed and Scopus databases The journal year of publication authors treatment technology clinical subject study design and level of evidence for each article were documented Influence was proposed by citation count and Our search identified a total of articles with the top 10 publications overall on the study of SRS spanning total citations Four articles reported on randomized controlled trials all of which evaluated intracranial metastases The most prominent subtopics included SRS for arteriovenous malformation glioblastoma and acoustic neuroma Greatest representation by treatment modality included Gamma Knife LINAC and This systematic reporting of the influential literature on SRS for intracranial and spinal pathologies underscores the technology rapid and wide reaching clinical applications Moreover the findings provide an academic guide to future health practitioners and engineers in their study of SRS for neurosurgery View details for PubMedID 30595165 Arterial cerebral perfusion changes after revascularization surgery in pediatric moyamoya disease and syndrome Journal of neurosurgery Pediatrics Quon Kim Lober Maleki Steinberg Yeom 2019 Abstract OBJECTIVEMoyamoya disease is a dynamic cerebrovascular condition that often requires vascular surveillance Arterial spin labeling ASL is an MR perfusion method that is increasingly used for stroke and other various neurovascular pathologies Unlike MRI ASL uses endogenous water molecules for signal and therefore obviates gadolinium use and provides direct not relative quantitative cerebral blood flow CBF measures Presently the potential role of ASL for evaluating postoperative pediatric moyamoya patients is relatively unexplored This study investigated the role for ASL in evaluating cerebral hemodynamic changes in children who underwent revascularization retrospective study examined 15 consecutive pediatric patients with moyamoya disease n 7 or moyamoya syndrome n 8 presenting between 2010 and 2014 who underwent revascularization and in whom 3T ASL was performed and postoperatively Postoperative MRI at least 3 months after revascularization procedure was used for analysis Quantitative CBF in various vascular territories was interrogated anterior middle and posterior cerebral arteries and basal ganglia supplied by the lenticulostriate collaterals resulting in evaluation of 20 brain revascularization CBF in the high middle cerebral artery territory significantly increased p accompanied by a decrease in CBF to the ipsilateral basal ganglia p No perfusion changes occurred in the remaining cerebral vascular territories after quantitative CBF showed improved cerebral perfusion to the middle cerebral artery territory after revascularization in children with both moyamoya syndrome and disease Reduced perfusion to the basal ganglia might reflect pruning of the lenticulostriate collaterals potentially from effects of revascularization ASL can quantitatively

neuroscience Arac Grimbaldeston Galli Bliss Steinberg 2019 13 126 Abstract Stroke is the leading cause of adult disability in the United States Because inflammation is a critical determinant of damage and recovery after stroke understanding the interplay between the immune system and the brain after stroke holds much promise for therapeutic intervention An understudied but important aspect of this interplay is the role of meninges that surround the brain All blood vessels travel through the meningeal space before entering the brain parenchyma making the meninges ideally located to act as an immune gatekeeper for the underlying parenchyma Emerging evidence suggests that the actions of immune cells resident in the meninges are essential for executing this gatekeeper function Mast cells MCs best known as proinflammatory effector cells are one of the resident immune cells in the meninges Here we discuss recent findings in the literature regarding the role of MCs located in the meningeal space and stroke pathology We review the latest advances in mouse models to investigate the roles of MCs and products in vivo and the importance of using these mouse models We examine the concept of the meninges playing a critical role in brain and immune interactions reevaluate the perspectives on the key effectors of stroke pathology and discuss the opportunities and challenges for therapeutic

Thirty patients with MMS and DS and 116 patients with DS only were identified retrospectively Three BP recordings were evaluated at set intervals months months and months before diagnosis of MMS These were then compared against control averages from patients with DS only To assess changes over the time we used general linear model repeated measures analysis of variance To identify independent

frequent causes of pediatric stroke and important risk factors for stroke recurrence Without tissue diagnosis vascular imaging is relied upon to identify the underlying etiology and prognosis We hypothesized that children with unilateral intracranial arteriopathy with lenticulostriate collaterals would demonstrate distinct vascular outcomes compared with children without retrospectively identified children with unilateral intracranial arteriopathy from two institutions Two blinded raters from each institution reviewed magnetic resonance or digital subtraction angiography at baseline and months Patients were grouped according to presence or absence of lenticulostriate collaterals Clinical features and vascular imaging outcomes were compared using univariate analysis and multivariate logistic children were included 22 males median age years range two to years and further stratified into the collateral group n 20 and group n 24 with median of months and 23 months respectively Both groups demonstrated similar rates of progression on vascular imaging at months 50 in the collateral group versus in the group P The collateral group was associated with asymptomatic clinical presentation normal brain MRI border zone infarcts and either vascular stabilization or new contralateral disease The group demonstrated either vascular improvement or discordant progression combination of improved and progressive lesions Using a multivariate model collaterals continued to be an independent predictor of vascular study suggests that lenticulostriate collaterals in children with unilateral intracranial arteriopathy may serve as a useful neuroimaging biomarker that helps to stratify patients with distinct clinical features and patterns of vascular evolution View details

have revealed important insights on brain repair and recovery mechanisms however the intrinsic changes that occur in spontaneously recovery after stroke is less clear The goal of this study is to elucidate the intrinsic changes in spontaneous recovery after stroke by directly investigating the transcriptome of primary motor cortex in mice that naturally recovered after stroke Male mice were subjected to transient middle cerebral artery occlusion Functional recovery was evaluated using the horizontal rotating beam test A novel lesion mapping analysis was used to evaluate infarct size and locations Ipsilesional and contralesional primary motor cortices iM1 and cM1 were processed for transcriptome analysis Cluster analysis of the stroke mice behavior performance revealed 2 distinct recovery groups a spontaneously recovered and a nonrecovered group Both groups showed similar lesion profile despite their differential recovery outcome transcriptome analysis revealed distinct biological pathways in the spontaneously recovered stroke mice in both iM1 and cM1 Correlation analysis revealed that 38 genes in the iM1 were significantly correlated with improved recovery whereas 74 genes were correlated in the cM1 In particular ingenuity pathway analysis highlighted the involvement of cAMP signaling in the cM1 with selective reduction of Adora2a adenosine receptor A2A Drd2 dopamine receptor D2 and Pde10a phosphodiesterase 10A expression in recovered mice Interestingly the expressions of these genes in cM1 were negatively correlated with behavioral recovery Our data revealed a panel of genes in the motor cortex of spontaneously recovered stroke mice and highlighted the involvement of contralesional cortex in spontaneous recovery particularly Adora2a Drd2 and cAMP signaling pathway Developing drugs targeting these candidates after stroke may provide beneficial recovery outcome View details for PubMedID 30354987 Reduced Intravoxel Incoherent Motion Microvascular

stimulation is a promising neurorestorative technique that has been shown to improve stroke recovery by altering neuronal activity of the target area However it is unclear whether the beneficial effect of stimulation is a result of neuronal or activation as existing stimulation techniques nonspecifically all cell types neurons glia endothelial cells oligodendrocytes in the stimulated area Furthermore which brain circuit is efficacious for brain stimulation is unknown Here we use the optogenetics approach to selectively stimulate neurons in the lateral cerebellar nucleus LCN a deep cerebellar nucleus that sends major excitatory output to multiple motor and sensory areas in the forebrain Repeated LCN stimulations resulted in a robust and persistent recovery on the rotating beam test even after cessation of stimulations for 2 weeks Furthermore western blot analysis demonstrated that LCN stimulations significantly increased the axonal growth protein GAP43 in the ipsilesional somatosensory cortex Our results demonstrate that stimulations of the LCN is sufficient to promote robust and persistent recovery after stroke and thus is a promising target for brain stimulation View

these patients presented with the typical constricted pupil We report the first 3 cases to our knowledge of mydriasis following present 3 cases of CEA followed by immediate postoperative development of ipsilateral mydriasis The patients were otherwise at their neurologic baseline and the mydriasis resolved over the ensuing few suggest that these cases are secondary to an ischemic phenomenon specifically to parasympathetic structures such as the ciliary ganglion oculomotor nerve resulting in autonomic dysfunction manifested by pupillary dilation A similar finding of mydriasis occurring subsequent to other carotid pathology has been reported with ischemia to parasympathetic structures also proposed as the underlying etiology Although pupillary dilation often represents a worrisome

Abstract The ARUBA trial 2014 concluded that medical management alone is superior to medical management plus interventional therapy for the treatment of unruptured brain arteriovenous malformations bAVMs This sparked considerable controversy among involved healthcare providers Here we evaluated the impact of ARUBA on the volume type and treatment modality of bAVMs referred to a large tertiary care center This was achieved by conducting a retrospective review of a prospectively maintained database of all bAVMs treated at Stanford Health Care and Stanford Children Health from January 2012 through July 2015 The case volume of bAVMs treated at Stanford has been relatively unchanged in the period of time leading up to and after ARUBA Furthermore there has been no significant change in the proportion of unruptured AVMs treated Although differences existed in types of interventions administered these differences are best explained by variations in the SM grades of AVMs treated during each study period rather than by underlying changes in treatment strategy Additional research is warranted to more thoroughly characterize the impact of ARUBA on the treatment patterns of bAVMS View

posterior cererbal and basilar arteries increased with disease severity particularly when both the anterior and middle cerebral arteries were occluded Basilar artery flow and ipsilateral internal carotid artery flow decreased after surgery Flow rates were different between angiographically robust and poor direct bypass grafts as well as between robust and patent changes in cerebral vessel flow

patients were older median 55 versus 50 years presented with a worse clinical status 60 with Hunt and Hess Score 2 versus 34 in clipped patients had a higher modified Fisher grade and were more likely to present with intraventricular hemorrhage 78 versus 56 Ischemic frontal lobe infarction OR 95 CI and recurrent artery of Heubner infarction OR 95 CI P were more common in clipped patients Clipped patients were more likely to be functionally dependent at discharge OR compared with coiled patients Mortality and clinical outcome at 3 months were similar between coiled and clipped lobe and recurrent artery of Heubner infarctions are more common after surgical clipping of ruptured anterior communicating artery aneurysms and are associated with poorer clinical outcomes at discharge View

Li Shuer Chang Steinberg Gephart 2017 Abstract Posterior fossa decompression surgeries for Chiari malformations are susceptible to complications such as pseudomeningocele external cerebrospinal fluid CSF leak and meningitis Various dural substitutes have been employed to improve surgical study examined whether the collagen matrix dural substitute type correlated with the incidence of complications following posterior fossa decompression in adult patients with Chiari I retrospective cohort study was conducted on 81 adult patients who underwent an elective decompressive surgery for treatment of symptomatic Chiari I malformations with duraplasty involving a dural substitute derived from either bovine or porcine collagen matrix Demographics and treatment characteristics were correlated with surgical total of 81 patients were included in the study Compared to bovine dural substitute porcine dural substitute was associated with a significantly higher risk of pseudomeningocele occurrence OR 95 CI P and a higher overall complication rate OR 95 CI P by univariate analysis There was no significant difference in the rate of meningitis repeat operations or overall complication rate between the two dural substitutes In addition estimated blood loss was a significant risk factor for meningitis P Multivariate analyses again demonstrated that porcine dural substitute was associated with pseudomeningocele occurrence though the association with higher overall complication rate did not reach substitutes generated from porcine collagen compared to those from bovine collagen were associated with a higher likelihood of pseudomeningocele development in adult patients undergoing Chiari I malformation decompression and duraplasty View details for PubMedID 28838875 Pipeline embolization device retraction and foreshortening after internal carotid artery blister aneurysm treatment Interventional neuroradiology journal of peritherapeutic neuroradiology surgical procedures and related neurosciences Heit Telischak Do Dodd Steinberg Marks 2017 23 6 Abstract Background Subarachnoid hemorrhage SAH secondary to rupture of a blister aneurysm BA results in high morbidity and mortality Endovascular treatment with the pipeline embolization device PED has been described as a new treatment strategy for these lesions We present the first reported case of PED retraction and foreshortening after treatment of a ruptured internal carotid artery ICA BA Case description A patient presented with SAH secondary to ICA BA rupture The patient was treated with telescoping PED placement across the BA After 5 days from treatment the patient developed a new SAH due to of the BA Digital subtraction angiography revealed an increase in caliber of the supraclinoid ICA with associated retraction and foreshortening of the PED that resulted in aneurysm uncovering and growth Conclusions PED should be oversized during ruptured BA treatment to prevent device retraction and aneurysm regrowth Frequent imaging follow up after BA treatment with PED is warranted to ensure aneurysm occlusion View details for PubMedID 28758549 Embolization followed by Radiosurgery for the

of the arteriovenous malformation AVM nidus in advance of radiosurgical treatment Embolization followed by radiosurgery for brain AVMs however is assessed the impact of embolization on nidal size before radiosurgical treatment and evaluated cure rates and complications by using embolization followed by retrospective review of our institutional AVM database identified 91 patients treated from 1995 to 2009 with embolization followed by radiosurgery and postembolization AVM volumes were measured with angiography and the modified AVM scores RBAS also were calculated and postembolization RBAS determined from volumes were correlated with postradiosurgical AVM volume declined from mL interquartile range mL to mL mL after embolization P Median RBAS scores decreased from mL mL to mL mL P Two of 91 had new fixed deficits after embolization however no patient had new disabling deficits modified Rankin Scale score 2 A total of 71 of 91 79 have had 3 years and 40 56 had complete obliteration

is superior to medical management plus interventional therapy for the treatment of unruptured brain arteriovenous malformations bAVMs This sparked considerable controversy among involved healthcare providers Here we evaluated the impact of ARUBA on the volume type and treatment modality of bAVMs referred to a large tertiary care center This was achieved by conducting a retrospective review of a prospectively maintained database of all bAVMs treated at Stanford Health Care and Stanford Children Health from January 2012 through July 2015 The case volume of bAVMs treated at Stanford has been relatively unchanged in the period of time leading up to and after ARUBA Furthermore there has been no significant change in the proportion of unruptured AVMs treated Although differences existed in types of interventions administered these differences are best explained by variations in the SM grades of AVMs treated during each study period rather than by underlying changes in treatment strategy

Prime Minister Winston Churchill met near Yalta in Crimea to discuss how War II WWII Europe should be organized Within 2 decades of this conference all 3 men had died President Roosevelt died 2 months after the Yalta Conference due to a hemorrhagic stroke Premier Stalin died 8 years later also due to a hemorrhagic stroke Finally Prime Minister Churchill died 20 years after the conference because of complications due to stroke At the time of Yalta these 3 men were the leaders of the most powerful countries in the world The subsequent deterioration of their health and eventual death had varying degrees of historical significance Churchill illness forced him to resign as British prime minister and the events that unfolded immediately after his resignation included Britain mismanagement of the Egyptian Suez Crisis and also a period of mistrust with the United States Furthermore Roosevelt was still president and Stalin was still premier at their times of passing so their deaths carried huge political ramifications not only for their respective countries but also for international relations The early death of Roosevelt in particular may have exacerbated miscommunication between America

including moyamoya syndrome These reports have been limited to pediatric patients presenting with recurrent transient ischemic attacks TIA or headaches Management has primarily been pharmacologic with only one prior report of surgical revascularization to our knowledge We report four cases of Noonan syndrome patients presenting with headaches sensorimotor strokes in childhood that caused unilateral sensorimotor impairment Cerebral angiography and MRI revealed bilateral moyamoya syndrome All patients underwent successful bilateral revascularization The first patient was a girl who presented following a hemorrhagic stroke and recovered well after indirect bypass The second patient was an adult with a history of childhood stroke whose symptoms progressed in adulthood She underwent a direct bypass and improved but continued to experience TIA at her 4 year The third patient was a girl with headaches and a new onset TIA who failed pharmacological therapy and subsequently underwent bilateral indirect bypass The fourth patient was a woman with worsening headaches and an occluded left middle cerebral artery from unilateral moyamoya syndrome A left sided direct bypass was completed given delayed MRI perfusion with poor augmentation To our knowledge these are the first reported surgical cases of combined Noonan and moyamoya syndrome These cases highlight the need to recognize

Ischemic stroke is the leading cause of upper extremity motor impairments Although several experimental stroke models exist modeling of upper extremity motor impairments which are unique to primates is not well established Cortical representation of dexterous movements in nonhuman primates is functionally and topographically similar to that in humans In this study we characterize the African green monkey model of focal ischemia reperfusion with a defined syndrome impaired dexterous ischemia was induced by transient occlusion of the M3 segment of the left middle cerebral artery Motor and cognitive functions after stroke were evaluated using the object retrieval task with Postmortem magnetic resonance imaging and histopathology were performed to map and characterize the middle cerebral artery occlusion consistently produced a necrotic infarct localized in the sensorimotor cortex in the middle cerebral artery territory The infarction was reproducible and resulted in significant loss of fine motor function characterized by impaired dexterity No significant cognitive impairment was detected Magnetic resonance imaging and histopathology demonstrated consistent and significant loss

from multiple sources ameliorates motor deficits after stroke However it is currently unknown to what extent the electrophysiological activity of grafted NSC progeny participates in the improvement of motor deficits and whether excitatory phenotypes of the grafted cells are beneficial or deleterious to sensorimotor performances To address this question we used optogenetic tools to drive the excitatory outputs of the grafted NSCs and assess the impact on local circuitry and sensorimotor performance We genetically engineered NSCs to express the ChR2 a cation channel that evokes neuronal depolarization and initiation of action potentials with precise temporal control to light stimulation To test the function of these cells in a stroke model rats were subjected to an ischemic stroke and grafted with The grafted NSCs identified with a nuclear marker survived in the tissue and coexpressed the ChR2 transgene with the neuronal markers TuJ1 and NeuN Gene expression analysis in

cerebrovascular occlusion and development of collateral vessels Approximately of cases are familial with a presumed low penetrance autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance Diagnosis commonly occurs only after clinical presentation The recent identification of the RNF213 founder mutation in the Asian population has made a significant contribution but the etiology of this disease remains unclear To further develop the variant landscape of MMD we performed whole exome sequencing of 125 unrelated predominantly nonfamilial ethnically diverse MMD patients in parallel with 125 internally sequenced matched controls using the same exome and analysis platform Three subpopulations were established Asian Caucasian and founder mutation cases We provided additional support for the previously observed RNF213 founder mutation in Asian cases P that was enriched among East Asians compared to Southeast Asian and Pacific Islander cases P and was absent in all Caucasian cases The most enriched variant in Caucasian P and founder mutation P cases was ZXDC a gene involved in MHC Class II activation Collapsing variant methodology ranked OBSCN a gene involved in myofibrillogenesis as most enriched in Caucasian P and founder mutation cases P These findings further support the East Asian origins of the RNF213 variant and more fully describe the genetic landscape of multiethnic MMD revealing novel

3 Abstract Cerebral aneurysms are common vascular lesions Little is known about the pathogenesis of these lesions and the process by which they destabilize and progress to rupture Treatment decisions are motivated by a desire to prevent rupture and the devastating morbidity and mortality associated with resulting subarachnoid hemorrhage SAH For patients presenting with SAH urgent intervention is required to stabilize the lesion and prevent Those patients fortunate enough to survive a presenting SAH and subsequent securing of their aneurysm must still face a spectrum of secondary sequelae which can include cerebral vasospasm delayed ischemia seizures cerebral edema hydrocephalus and endocrinologic and systemic dysfunction in cardiac pulmonary and renal systems Increased focus on understanding the pathophysiology and molecular characteristics of these secondary processes will enable the development of targeted therapeutics and novel diagnostics for improved patient selection in personalized medicine trials for SAH In unruptured cerebral aneurysms treatment decisions are less clear and currently based solely on treating larger lesions using rigid aneurysm size cutoffs

time of a hemorrhagic presentation are of smaller size suggesting that small aneurysms are indeed not benign lesions As such biomarkers that better predict which aneurysms represent lesions that warrant clinical intervention are of vital importance Recent advancements in genomic and proteomic technologies have enabled the identification of molecular characteristics that may prove useful in tracking aneurysm growth and progression and identifying targets for prophylactic therapeutic interventions Novel quantitative neuroimaging technologies have also recently emerged capable of characterization of hemodynamic factors inflammation and structural changes in aneurysmal walls The combined use of these quantitative neuroimaging and approaches called Radiogenomics is a technique that holds great promise in better characterizing individual aneurysms In the near future these radiogenomic techniques may help improve quality of life and patient outcomes via approaches to the treatment of unruptured cerebral aneurysms and personalized medical management of secondary processes following aneurysmal SAH View details for DOI View details for PubMedID 27446925 View details for

TDAVFs are complex lesions with the arteriovenous fistula located between the leaves of the tentorium cerebelli While a large portion of dural arteriovenous fistulae are treated endovascularly TDAVF may require additional microsurgical treatment given their high risk of hemorrhage and multitude of feeders We describe the case of a male who presented with hemorrhage from a straight sinus and galenic TDAVF The straight sinus portion of the fistula was obliterated by 3 endovascular treatments and 1 microsurgical treatment The galenic component of the TDAVF persisted and was approached via a posterior interhemispheric approach in a lateral position This video demonstrates surgical technique and anatomy associated with this rarely seen dural arteriovenous fistula The video can be found

WORLD NEUROSURGERY Mukerji Cook Steinberg 2015 84 6 Abstract To report 2 cases of patients who had an ischemic stroke and an intracerebral hematoma after a superficial temporal cerebral artery bypass with a thermal diffusion blood flow probe in situ and emphasize how a change in the way the data are presented could have led to an earlier patients had flow probes within 2 cm of the graft site and were thus close enough to be representative of local or regional rather than global perfusion Data smoothening was applied to the raw data that were available and displayed on the monitor Both the smoothed plots and the raw plots were clinical correlation was observed between the flow probe data and the clinical condition of both patients This was more apparent when viewing the smoothed there was good clinical correlation data displayed on the perfusion monitor can be incorrectly interpreted because the ratio is small We therefore suggest an alternative presentation of perfusion data for clinicians to recognize hypoperfusion and to take informed action before a stroke or hematoma is clinically manifest View details for DOI View details for Web of Science ID 000366286300113 View

the case of a man with bilateral moyamoya disease and prior strokes who developed an asystolic cardiac arrest while undergoing revascularization surgery under mild hypothermia The patient was successfully treated with venoarterial VA extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ECMO after manual cardiopulmonary resuscitation CPR was unsuccessful for 45 minutes ECMO is a cardiopulmonary support system that is indicated for respiratory failure in pediatric and adult patients It is increasingly being used as an extension to mechanical CPR for patients who have suffered cardiac arrest if the underlying cause of cardiac arrest is thought to be reversible Identifying which patients should be placed on emergency ECMO after cardiac arrest is controversial given its high morbidity and mortality ECMO in neurosurgical settings has associated risks of intracranial hemorrhage and neurological compromise while resource utilization is paramount given the high costs of this treatment This paper is significant because it describes the use of ECMO in an unindicated setting Limited data are available for ECMO usage after cardiac arrest with baseline cerebral ischemia Furthermore this paper raises important considerations for extracorporeal CPR use in a patient who had recently undergone craniotomy The patient in this report remained on ECMO for 48 hours after which he was successfully weaned He developed a pericardial effusion and compartment syndrome from the ECMO but made a complete neurological recovery Use of ECMO emergently in an appropriately chosen neurosurgical

Steinbergtt 2014 184 9 Abstract Stroke is the leading cause of adult disability and the fourth most common cause of death in the United States Inflammation is thought to play an important role in stroke pathology but the factors that promote inflammation in this setting remain to be fully defined An understudied but important factor is the role of immune cells in modulating brain pathology Although different immune cells traffic through meningeal vessels en route to the brain mature mast cells do not circulate but are resident in the meninges With the use of genetic and cell transfer approaches in mice we identified evidence that meningeal mast cells can importantly contribute to the key features of stroke pathology including infiltration of granulocytes and activated macrophages brain swelling and infarct size We also obtained evidence that two mast products and to a lesser extent chemokine motif ligand 7 can contribute to stroke pathology These findings indicate a novel role

been considered collision tumors since little intermingling of the two elements has been present In contrast we hypothesized that the two elements of the might instead derive from a common origin To test this we sampled the separate regions of these biphasic tumors and assessed each component for the BRAF V600E mutation a genetic feature seen in of pure PXAs The BRAF mutation was found in both tumor areas in all cases suggesting a common origin for the components rather than a collision tumor These biphasic cases represent a new histomorphological combination of neuroepithelial neoplastic elements These cases further expand the range of glial neoplasia in which epithelioid morphology is encountered and add to the growing list of biphasic tumors harboring the BRAF V600E mutation View

Inflammation and Attenuates Immunodepression in Rats CNS NEUROSCIENCE THERAPEUTICS Gu Xiong Ito Lee Xu Krams Steinberg Zhao 2014 20 1 Abstract Stroke causes both brain inflammation and immunodepression hypothermia is known to attenuate brain inflammation but its role in immunodepression SIID of the peripheral immune system remains unknown This study investigated the effects in rats of moderate hypothermia on SIID and brain was induced in rats by permanent distal middle cerebral artery occlusion combined with transient bilateral common carotid artery occlusion while body temperature was reduced to PCR flow cytometry in vitro proliferation assays in vivo hypersensitivity DTH reaction and confocal microscopy were used to study SIID and brain hypothermia helped maintain certain leukocytes in the peripheral blood and spleen and enhanced proliferation in vitro and hypersensitivity in vivo suggesting that hypothermia reduces SIID In contrast in the brain brief hypothermia inhibited mRNA expression of cytokine and proinflammatory mediators and Brief hypothermia also attenuated the infiltration of lymphocytes neutrophils MPO cells and macrophages CD68 cells

limited capacity for regeneration after acute and chronic injury An attractive approach to stimulate neural plasticity in the brain is to transplant stem cells in order to restore function Here we discuss potential mechanisms of action current knowledge and future perspectives of clinical stem cell research for stroke and traumatic brain data using various models suggest stem cell therapy to be a promising therapeutic avenue Progress has been made in elucidating the mechanism of action of various cell types used shifting the hypothesis from neural replacement to enhancing endogenous repair processes Translation of these findings in clinical trials is currently being pursued with emphasis on both safety as well as trials are currently recruiting patients in phase I and II trials to gain more insight in the therapeutic potential of stem cells in acute cerebral injury A close interplay between results of these clinical trials and more extensive basic research is essential for future

Cutler A Zemlyak Sun Munhoz Chang Sorrells Ermini Decker Bertrand A Dinkel Steinberg Sapolsky 2013 8 4 Abstract Research with experimental stroke models has identified a wide range of therapeutic proteins that can prevent the brain damage caused by this form of acute neurological injury Despite this we do not yet have safe and effective ways to deliver therapeutic proteins to the injured brain and this remains a major obstacle for clinical translation Current targeted strategies typically involve invasive neurosurgery whereas systemic approaches produce the undesirable outcome of protein delivery to the entire brain rather than solely to the injury site As a potential way to address this we developed a protein delivery system modeled after the endogenous immune cell response to brain injury Using dendritic cells DCs we find that these cells can transiently home to brain injury in a rat model of stroke with both temporal and spatial selectivity We present a standardized method to derive DCs from bone marrow and show that injury targeting is dependent on culture conditions that maintain an immature DC phenotype Further we find evidence that when loaded with therapeutic cargo cultured DCs can suppress initial neuron death caused by an ischemic injury These results demonstrate a method to target ischemic brain injury and may ultimately provide a way to selectively deliver therapeutic compounds to the injured brain View details for DOI View details for Web of Science ID 000317893400111 View details for PubMedID 23613937 View details for PubMedCentralID PMC3627911 Immune

societal and economic impact Parkinson disease PD is a neurological disorder characterized by the loss of midbrain dopaminergic DA neurons The generation of this cell type will fulfill a currently unmet therapeutic need We report on the isolation and perpetuation of a human neural stem cell line hNSCs from hESCs These hNSCs grew as a monolayer and uniformly expressed the neural precursor markers nestin vimentin and a radial glial phenotype We describe a process to direct the differentiation of these hNSCs towards the DA lineage Glial conditioned media acted synergistically with fibroblastic growth factor and leukemia inhibitory factor to induce the expression of the DA marker tyrosine hydroxylase TH in the hNSC progeny The neurotrophic factor did not fully mimic the effects of conditioned media The hNSCs expressed the transcription factors Nurr1 and Pitx3 The inductive effects did not modify the level of the glutamic acid decarboxylase GAD transcript a marker for GABAergic neurons while the TH transcript increased Immunocytochemical analysis demonstrated that the cells did not with GAD The transplantation of these hNSCs into the primate MPTP model of PD

In Vivo Stroke in Mice STROKE Gu Xiong Zhang Xu Steinberg Zhao 2012 43 7 Abstract T cells and their subsets modulate ischemic brain injury We studied the effects of the absence of T cell subsets on brain infarction after in vivo stroke and then used an in vitro coculture system of splenocytes and neurons to further identify the roles of T cell subsets in neuronal was induced by middle cerebral artery suture occlusion in mice and infarct sizes were measured 2 days poststroke Splenocytes were cocultured with neurons and neuronal survival was measured 3 days deficiency of both T and B cells severe combined immunodeficiency and the paucity of CD4 or CD8 T cells equally resulted in smaller infarct sizes as measured 2 days poststroke Although a functional deficiency of regulatory T cells had no effect impaired Th1 immunity reduced infarction and impaired Th2 immunity aggravated brain injury which may be due to an inhibited and enhanced inflammatory response in mice deficient in Th1 and Th2 immunity respectively In the in vitro coculture system splenocytes resulted in neuronal death The neurotoxicity of splenocytes from these immunodeficient mice was consistent with their effects on stroke in vivo except for the mice with the paucity of CD4 or CD8 T cells which did not alter the ratio of neuronal cell subsets play critical roles in brain injury induced by stroke The detrimental versus beneficial effects of Th1 cells and Th2 cells both in vivo and in vitro reveal differential therapeutic target strategies for stroke treatment View details for DOI View details for

Reperfusion and the Protective Mechanisms Dispute the Importance of Akt Activity AGING AND DISEASE Takahashi Steinberg Zhao 2012 3 3 Abstract Lithium is a mood stabilizer shown to have neuroprotective effects against several chronic and acute neuronal injuries including stroke However it is unknown whether lithium treatment protects against brain injury in a rat model of permanent distal middle cerebral artery occlusion MCAo combined with transient bilateral common carotid artery occlusion CCAo a model that mimics human stroke with partial reperfusion In addition whether lithium treatment alters Akt activity as measured by the kinase activity assay has not been reported although it is known to inhibit GSK3β activity After stroke Akt activity contributes to neuronal survival while GSK3β activity causes neuronal death We report that a bolus of lithium injection at stroke onset robustly reduced infarct size measured by chloride TTC staining at 48 h and inhibited cell death in the ischemic penumbra but not in the ischemic core as shown by TUNEL staining performed 24 h However lithium treatment did not alter the reduction in Akt activity as measured by Akt kinase assay We further showed that lithium did not alter phosphorylated GSK3β protein levels or the degradation of a substrate of GSK3β which is consistent with previous findings that treatment is required for lithium to alter GSK3β phosphorylation In summary we show innovative data that lithium protects against stroke in a focal ischemia model with partial reperfusion however our results dispute the

ALWAYS REPRESENT ITS KINASE ACTIVITY IN A RAT MODEL OF FOCAL CEREBRAL ISCHEMIA WITH OR WITHOUT ISCHEMIC PRECONDITIONING NEUROSCIENCE Takahashi Steinberg Zhao 2012 209 Abstract The extracellular kinase ERK protein requires a dual phosphorylation at conserved threonine and tyrosine residues to be fully activated under normal physiological conditions Thus kinase activity is often defined by the quantity of phosphorylated kinase However this may not accurately represent its true activity under certain pathological conditions We investigated whether kinase activity is proportional to its phosphorylation state in a rat focal ischemia model with and without rapid ischemic preconditioning We showed that protein levels were increased and kinase activity was increased in animals receiving ischemic preconditioning alone without test ischemia compared with sham group P suggesting that protein levels represent its kinase activity under these conditions However preconditioning plus test ischemia robustly blocked kinase activity whereas it increased protein levels beyond those receiving test ischemia alone suggesting that protein levels were not representative of actual kinase activity in this pathological condition In conclusion protein phosphorylation levels of do not always correspond to kinase activity thus measuring the true kinase activity is essential View details

Alizadeh A Clarke Weissman 2012 109 17 Abstract CD47 a do eat me signal for phagocytic cells is expressed on the surface of all human solid tumor cells Analysis of patient tumor and matched adjacent normal nontumor tissue revealed that CD47 is overexpressed on cancer cells CD47 mRNA expression levels correlated with a decreased probability of survival for multiple types of cancer CD47 is a ligand for SIRPα a protein expressed on macrophages and dendritic cells In vitro blockade of CD47 signaling using targeted monoclonal antibodies enabled macrophage phagocytosis of tumor cells that were otherwise protected Administration of antibodies inhibited tumor growth in orthotopic immunodeficient mouse xenotransplantation models established with patient tumor cells and increased the survival of the mice over time antibody therapy initiated on larger tumors inhibited tumor growth and prevented or treated metastasis but initiation of the therapy on smaller tumors was potentially curative The safety and efficacy of targeting CD47 was further tested and validated in immune competent hosts using an orthotopic mouse breast cancer model These results suggest all human solid tumor cells require CD47 expression to suppress phagocytic innate immune surveillance and elimination These data taken together with similar findings with other human neoplasms show that CD47 is a commonly expressed molecule on all cancers its function to block phagocytosis is known and blockade of its function leads to tumor cell phagocytosis and elimination CD47 is therefore a validated target for

UNITED STATES OF AMERICA Cheng Lee Culbertson Sun Talati Manley Li Zhao Lyons Zhou Steinberg Sapolsky 2012 109 14 Abstract Stroke causes brain dysfunction and neuron death and the lack of effective therapies heightens the need for new therapeutic targets Here we identify prokineticin 2 PK2 as a mediator for cerebral ischemic injury PK2 is a bioactive peptide initially discovered as a regulator of gastrointestinal motility Multiple biological roles for PK2 have been discovered including circadian rhythms angiogenesis and neurogenesis However the role of PK2 in neuropathology is unknown Using primary cortical cultures we found that PK2 mRNA is by several pathological stressors including hypoxia reactive oxygen species and excitotoxic glutamate PK2 expression is dependent on NMDA receptor activation and extracellular calcium Enriched neuronal culture studies revealed that neurons are the principal source of PK2 Using in vivo models of stroke we found that PK2 mRNA is induced in the ischemic cortex and striatum Central delivery of PK2 worsens infarct volume whereas PK2 receptor antagonist decreases infarct volume and central inflammation while improving functional outcome Direct central inhibition of PK2 using RNAi also reduces infarct volume These findings indicate that PK2 can be activated by pathological stimuli such as and excitotoxic glutamate and identify PK2 as a deleterious mediator for cerebral ischemia View details for DOI View details for Web of Science ID 000302294700073 View details for PubMedID 22431614 View details for PubMedCentralID PMC3325724

by CBF and CVR and with secondary damage from MMD as estimated by cortical stroke and retrospective analysis of 31 adult patients with MMD was performed was used to obtain CBF and CVR and MRI was reviewed to grade cortical stroke and WMD Two tests of executive functioning FAS and were correlated with imaging findings A multiple regression analysis was was a significant overall positive relationship between mean CBF and FAS P and scores P A significant negative relationship was present between the WMD score and the FAS P and scores P analysis demonstrated that FAS and scores were significantly decreased by the presence of a posterior stroke P and P or WMD P and P All patients with posterior WMD or stroke also had secondary disease in the anterior executive functioning in adults with MMD is most strongly associated secondary damage in the form of WMD or cortical stroke The effect is most profound with lobe involvement likely a reflection of overall disease severity

expression and the discovery of protein biomarkers to facilitate diagnosis and treatment The general premise of the biomarker field is that in vivo factors present in either tissue or circulating biofluids reflect pathological changes and can be identified and analyzed This approach offers an opportunity to illuminate changes occurring at both the population and patient levels toward the realization of personalized medicine This review is intended to provide clinicians with an overview of protein biomarkers of disease and injury for clinical use and to highlight methodology and potential pitfalls We examine the neuroproteomic biomarker field and discuss the hallmarks and the challenges of clinically relevant biomarker discovery relating to central nervous system pathology We discuss the issues in the maturation of potential biomarkers from discovery to Food and Drug Administration approval and review several platforms for protein biomarker discovery including protein microarray and mass proteomics We describe the application of microfluidic technologies to the evolution of a robust clinical test Finally we highlight several biomarkers currently in use for cancer

Abstract Moyamoya disease is characterized by chronic stenoocclusive vasculopathy involving the distal supraclinoid internal carotid arteries and presents with ischemic or hemorrhagic symptoms We review advances in the understanding and management of moyamoya revascularization either direct or indirect is the cornerstone of treatment for moyamoya disease Recent advances have been made in understanding the molecular biology and pathophysiology of moyamoya disease and new genetic mutations and deletions have been identified Imaging for moyamoya disease is also rapidly improving with new sequences of MRI and better methods of assessing ischemia and cerebrovascular reserve Positron emission tomography has emerged as an important tool to measure cerebrovascular reserve Novel surgical techniques assess patency and ischemia during superficial temporal to middle cerebral artery bypass including indocyanine green videoangiography to evaluate anastomosis patency and various methods to monitor intraoperative blood flow Newer methods of indirect revascularization have been described with placement of more tissues supplied by the external carotid artery on the brain surface Postoperative hyperperfusion to the chronically ischemic brain tissue is a recently identified causative factor of complications Interestingly complications from hyperperfusion mimic those caused by ischemia although they have different treatments making the role of postoperative blood flow assessment important in distinguishing between the two Awareness has also increased that even asymptomatic patients can experience significant cognitive decline attributable to chronic ischemia Whether this reverts after successful revascularization requires revascularization with direct indirect and

Guzman 2011 42 10 Abstract The inflammatory response is a critical component of ischemic stroke In addition to its physiological role the mechanisms behind transendothelial recruitment of immune cells also offer a unique therapeutic opportunity for translational stem cell therapies Recent reports have demonstrated homing of neural stem cells NSC into the injured brain areas after intravascular delivery However the mechanisms underlying the process of transendothelial recruitment remain largely unknown Here we describe the critical role of the chemokine CCL2 and its receptor CCR2 in targeted homing of NSC after hours after induction of stroke using the model in mice and reporter NSC were delivered Histology and bioluminescence imaging were used to investigate NSC homing to the ischemic brain Functional outcome was assessed with the horizontal ladder NSC isolated from and mice we show that receptor deficiency significantly impaired transendothelial diapedesis specifically in response to CCL2 Accordingly NSC injected into mice exhibited significantly decreased homing Bioluminescence imaging showed robust recruitment of cells within 6 hours after transplantation in contrast to cells Mice receiving grafts after ischemic injury showed a significantly improved recovery of neurological deficits as compared to animals with transplantation of interaction is critical for transendothelial recruitment of intravascularly delivered NSC in response to ischemic injury This finding could have significant implications in advancing minimally invasive intravascular therapeutics

characterized by a progressive stenosis of the terminal part of the intracranial carotid arteries and the compensatory development of abnormal and fragile collateral vessels also called moyamoya vessels leading to ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke Moyamoya angiopathy can either be the sole manifestation of the disease moyamoya disease or be associated with various conditions including neurofibromatosis Down syndrome TAAD thoracic aortic aneurysm and radiotherapy of head tumors moyamoya syndromes Its prevalence is ten times higher in Japan than in Europe and an estimated 6 of moyamoya disease is familial in Japan The pathophysiological mechanisms of this condition remain obscure Here we report on three unrelated families affected with an moyamoya syndrome characterized by the association of a moyamoya angiopathy short stature and a stereotyped facial dysmorphism Other symptoms include an hypergonadotropic hypogonadism hypertension dilated cardiomyopathy premature coronary heart disease premature hair graying and early bilateral acquired cataract We show that this syndromic moyamoya is caused by Xq28 deletions removing and BRCC3 We also show that brcc3 morphant zebrafish display angiogenesis defects that are rescued by expression of brcc3 Altogether these data strongly suggest that BRCC3 a deubiquitinating enzyme that is part of the cellular BRCA1 and BRISC

Stroke remains the leading cause of disability in the Western world Despite decades of work no clinically effective therapies exist to facilitate recovery from stroke Stem cells may have the potential to minimize injury and promote recovery after stroke AREAS COVERED Transplanted stem cells have been shown in animal models to migrate to the injured region secrete neurotrophic compounds promote revascularization enhance plasticity and regulate the inflammatory response thereby minimizing injury Endogenous neural stem cells also have a remarkable propensity to respond to injury Under select conditions subventricular zone progenitors may be mobilized to replace lost neurons In response to focal infarcts neuroblasts play important trophic roles to minimize neural injury Importantly these endogenous repair mechanisms may be experimentally augmented leading to robust improvements in function Ongoing clinical studies are now assessing the safety and feasibility of therapies for stroke

infarction and functional deficits Many preclinical studies have focused on a small time window after the ischemic episode to evaluate functional outcome for screening therapeutic candidates Short evaluation periods following injury have led to significant setbacks due to lack of information on the delayed effects of treatments as well as and reversible neuroprotection so called results In this report we evaluated functional deficit for 90 days after MCAO in two rat strains with two durations of ischemic insult in order to identify the best experimental paradigm to assess injury and subsequent recovery Behavioral outcomes were measured followed by weekly assessment Behavioral tests included the composite neurological score neuroscore rearing test forelimb placing test foot fault test and the CatWalk Brain lesions were assessed to correlate injury to behavior outcomes at the end of study Our results indicate that infarction volume in rats was dependent on occlusion duration In contrast the infarction volume in Wistar rats did not correlate with the duration of ischemic episode Functional outcomes were not dependent on occlusion time in either strain however measurable deficits were detectable in limb asymmetry and neuroscores forelimb placing paw swing speed and gait coordination In conclusion these behavioral assays in combination with an extended assessment

advantageous Using hypoxia responsive elements HRE and antioxidant responsive elements ARE we have constructed an vector activated by hypoxia and reactive oxygen species ROS In COS7 cells the inducible vectors are highly activated by oxygen deprivation hydrogen peroxide treatment and the transcription factor factor 2 Nrf2 Using a defective herpes virus the neuroprotective potential of this inducible vector was tested by the transcription factor Nrf2 In primary cortical cultures expression of the inducible protects against oxygen glucose deprivation similar to that afforded by the constitutively expressed Nrf2 This vector system is advantageous in that it allows the expression of a transgene to be activated not only during hypoxia but also maintained after reperfusion thus prolonging the transgene expression during an ischemic insult This vector system will be a valuable gene therapy tool for activating genes in cerebrovascular diseases View details for DOI View details

29 2 Abstract Cell transplantation offers a novel therapeutic strategy for stroke however how transplanted cells function in vivo is poorly understood We show for the first time that after subacute transplantation into the ischemic brain of human central nervous system stem cells grown as neurospheres the stem factor human vascular endothelial growth factor hVEGF is necessary for functional recovery We correlate this functional recovery to effects on the host brain including multiple facets of vascular repair and its unexpected suppression of the inflammatory response We found that transplanted affected multiple parameters in the brain with different kinetics early improvement in barrier integrity and suppression of inflammation was followed by a delayed spatiotemporal regulated increase in neovascularization These events coincided with a bimodal pattern of functional recovery with an early recovery independent of neovascularization and a delayed recovery coincident with neovascularization Therefore cell transplantation therapy offers an exciting multimodal strategy for brain repair in stroke and potentially other disorders with a vascular or inflammatory component

symptomatic despite endovascular treatment or presented with recurrent symptoms and recurrence of on angiography requiring subsequent adult MMD patients who underwent endovascular treatment with angioplasty or stenting were referred for further evaluation and treatment from outside hospitals Data were collected from clinical referral notes and angiograms or reports All patients underwent repeat cerebral angiography to assess the extent of disease and results of prior endovascular endovascular procedures were performed in all 5 patients Internal carotid artery ICA balloon angioplasty and Wingspan stenting was performed in 2 patients 3 arteries One patient had angioplasty without stenting Two patients had M1 angioplasty and Wingspan stenting All patients developed repeat transient ischemic attacks following treatment attributable to the vascular territories of endovascular treatment Repeat endovascular treatment was performed in 3 patients at a mean of 4 months range Two went on to a third endovascular treatment due to progression of disease in the vessel The average time of symptom recurrence after initial endovascular therapy was months months angiography when referred to our institution demonstrated instent restenosis of the stented vessel in 3 and occlusion in 1 patient Due to persistence of symptoms cerebral revascularization was performed in all is a progressive angiopathy Angioplasty and stenting may temporarily improve the cerebral blood flow and decrease cerebral ischemic events but do not appear to be durable nor provide prevention against future ischemic

a Focal Ischemia Model in Rat Stroke research and treatment Zhao Steinberg 2011 2011 Abstract Although many studies have shown the great potential of induced hypothermia in stroke treatment we recognize that there are limitations to the protective effects of hypothermia even in the laboratory Here we review our experiments on the protective effects of hypothermia in rats Focal ischemia was induced by bilateral common carotid artery CCA occlusion for 1 to 2 hours combined with permanent or transient middle cerebral artery MCA occlusion We compared the effects of mild and moderate hypothermia evaluated therapeutic time windows and studied the underlying mechanisms On review our findings revealed that the protective effects of induced mild hypothermia were limited and the therapeutic time window of even moderate hypothermia was very short in our specific models although this limitation might be due to the relatively brief periods of hypothermia used In addition we found that hypothermia reduced brain injury by preserving Akt activity PTEN phosphorylation and εPKC activity while inhibiting ROS production and δPKC activity View details for DOI View details for

disease is a rare cerebrovascular disease characterized by idiopathic bilateral stenosis or occlusion of bilateral internal carotid arteries and the development of characteristic leptomeningeal collateral vessels at the base of the brain Typical presentations include transient ischemic attacks or stroke and hemorrhage Presentation with movement disorders is extremely rare especially in the pediatric population The authors describe the cases of 4 children with moyamoya disease who presented with movement disorders Among 446 patients 118 pediatric with moyamoya disease surgically treated by the senior author 4 pediatric patients had presented with movement disorders The clinical records imaging studies surgical details and postoperative clinical and imaging data were retrospectively reviewed The initial presenting symptom was movement disorder in all 4 patients chorea in 2 hemiballismus in 1 and involuntary limb shaking in 1 All the patients had watershed infarcts involving the frontal subcortical region on MR imaging Additionally 1 patient had a ganglionic infarct emission computed tomography studies showed frontoparietal cortical and subcortical hypoperfusion in all patients Three patients had bilateral disease whereas 1 had unilateral disease All the patients underwent superficial temporal cerebral artery bypass Postoperatively all 4 patients had complete improvement in their symptoms The SPECT scans revealed normal perfusion in 3 patients and a small residual perfusion deficit in 1 Movement disorders are a rare presenting feature of moyamoya disease Hypoperfusion of the frontal cortical and subcortical region was seen in all patients and the symptomatology was attributed to ischemic dysfunction and imbalance in the circuitry Combined

ischemic preconditioning have received extensive studies few have addressed the mechanisms associated with rapid ischemic postconditioning We investigated whether ischemic tolerance induced by rapid preconditioning is regulated by the Akt survival signaling pathway Stroke was generated by permanent occlusion of the left distal middle cerebral artery MCA plus 30 min or 1 h occlusion of the bilateral common carotid artery CCA in male rats Rapid preconditioning performed 1h before stroke onset reduced infarct size by 69 in rats with 30 min CCA occlusion but by only 19 with 1 h occlusion After control ischemia with 30 min CCA occlusion Western Blot showed that was transiently increased while Akt kinase assay showed that Akt activity was decreased Although preconditioning did not change levels at 1h and 5h compared with control ischemia it attenuated reduction in Akt activity at 5h in the penumbra However preconditioning did not change the levels of and in the Akt pathway all of which were decreased after stroke At last the PI3K kinase inhibitor LY294002 completely reversed the protection from ischemic preconditioning In conclusion Akt contributes to the protection of

poor postnatal growth adult stature approximately 100 cm severe microcephaly skeletal dysplasia characteristic facial features and normal or near normal intelligence An Institutional Review Board IRB approved registry was created and currently follows 25 patients with a diagnosis of MOPD II Based on previous studies a neurovascular screening program was implemented and 13 52 of these patients have been found to have cerebral neurovascular abnormalities including moyamoya angiopathy intracranial aneurysms The typical moyamoya pathogenesis begins with vessel narrowing in the supraclinoid internal carotid artery anterior cerebral A1 or middle cerebral M1 artery segments The narrowing may predominate initially on one side progresses to bilateral stenosis with subsequent occlusion of the vessels and collateral formation We present four patients who on neurovascular screening were found to have cerebrovascular changes Two were asymptomatic one presented with a severe headache and projectile vomiting related to a ruptured aneurysm and one presented after an apparent decline in cognitive functioning Analysis of the registry suggests screening for moyamoya disease be performed at the time of MOPD II diagnosis and at least every months using MRA or computerized tomographic angiography CTA We believe this is imperative If diagnosed early enough and aneurysm treatment in skilled hands can be performed safely and prevent or minimize sequelae in this population Emergent evaluation is also needed when other neurologic or cardiac symptoms are present View details for DOI View details for

hypertension NEUROSURGICAL FOCUS Arac Lee Steinberg Marcellus Marks 2009 27 5 Abstract Multiple pathophysiological mechanisms have been proposed for the increased intracranial pressure observed in idiopathic intracranial hypertension IIH The condition is well characterized with intractable headaches visual obscurations and papilledema as dominant features mainly affecting obese women With the advent of MR venography and increased use of cerebral angiography there has been recent emphasis on the significant number of patients with IIH found to have associated nonthrombotic dural venous sinus stenosis This has led to a renewed interest in endovascular stenting as a treatment for IIH However the assumption that venous stenosis leads to a high pressure gradient that decreases CSF resorption through arachnoid villi requires further evidence In this paper the authors analyze the published results to date of dural venous sinus stenting in patients with IIH They also present a case from their institution for illustration The pathophysiological mechanism in IIH requires further elucidation but venous sinus stenosis with subsequent intracranial hypertension appears to be an important mechanism in at least a subgroup of patients with IIH Among these patients 78 had complete relief or improvement of their main presenting symptoms after endovascular stenting Resolution or improvement in papilledema was seen in of patients Endovascular stenting should be considered whenever venous sinus stenosis is diagnosed in patients with IIH View details for DOI View details for

AND METABOLISM Lee Zhao Maier Steinberg 2009 29 9 Abstract We recently showed that intraischemic moderate hypothermia 30 degrees C reduces ischemic damage through the Akt pathway after permanent distal middle cerebral artery occlusion in rats The only Akt pathway component preserved by hypothermia is phosphorylated phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 which suggests that may have a central role in neuroprotection Reactive oxygen species ROS are critically involved in mediating ischemic damage after stroke by interacting with signaling molecules including Akt PTEN and kinase C PKC We investigated the protective mechanisms of moderate hypothermia on these signaling proteins after transient focal ischemia in rats Early moderate hypothermia 3 h was administered 15 mins before reperfusion and delayed moderate hypothermia 3 h was applied 15 mins after reperfusion Our results indicate that early hypothermia reduced infarction whereas delayed hypothermia did not However both early and delayed hypothermia maintained levels of superoxide dismutase and phosphorylated Akt and blocked cleavage suggesting that these factors may not be critical to the protection of hypothermia Nevertheless early hypothermia preserved levels after reperfusion whereas delayed hypothermia did not Furthermore ROS inhibition maintained levels of after stroke Together these findings suggest that phosphorylation levels of PTEN are closely associated with the protective effect of early hypothermia against stroke View details for DOI View details for Web of Science ID

young adults Biological predictors of future ICH risk are lacking and controversy exists over previous studies of natural history risk among predominantly ruptured BAVM cohorts Recent studies have suggested that the majority of BAVMs are now diagnosed as unruptured lesions and that the risk according to natural history among these lesions may be less than previously assumed In the first part of this review the authors discuss available data on the natural history of BAVMs and highlight the need for future studies that aim to develop surrogate biomarkers of disease progression that accurately predict future risk of ICH in BAVMs The etiology of BAVM remains unknown Recent studies have suggested a role for genetic factors in the pathogenesis of sporadic BAVM which is further supported by reports of familial occurrence of BAVM and association with known systemic genetic disorders such as disease disease and syndrome Molecular characterization of BAVM tissue demonstrates a highly angiogenic milieu with evidence of increased endothelial cell turnover Taken together with a number of reports of de novo BAVM formation radiographic growth after initial BAVM diagnosis and regrowth after successful treatment of BAVM these findings challenge the assumption that BAVMs are static lesions of congenital origin In the second part of this review the authors discuss available data on the origins of BAVM and offer insights into future investigations into genetics and endothelial progenitor cell involvement in the pathogenesis of BAVM Current treatment options for BAVM focus on removal or obliteration of the lesion in an attempt to protect against future ICH risk including microsurgical resection endovascular embolization and stereotactic radiosurgery SRS In the third part of this review the authors discuss available data on SRS in BAVMs and highlight the need for future studies on the radiobiology of BAVMs especially in regard to biomarker detection for tracking SRS response during the latency period Insights from future investigations in BAVM may not only prove important for the development of novel therapies and relevant biomarkers for BAVM but could also

presentation and outcome of moyamoya disease remain varied based on angiographic studies alone and much work has been done to study cerebral hemodynamics in this group of patients The ability to measure cerebral blood flow CBF accurately continues to improve with time and with it a better understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms in patients with moyamoya disease The main imaging techniques used to evaluate cerebral hemodynamics include PET SPECT CT dynamic perfusion CT MR imaging with dynamic susceptibility contrast and with arterial spin labeling and Doppler ultrasonography More invasive techniques include intraoperative ultrasonography The authors review the current knowledge of CBF in this group of patients and the role each main quantitative method has played in

Steinberg Zabramski Marchuk A 2009 18 5 Abstract Cerebral cavernous malformations CCMs are vascular anomalies of the central nervous system comprising dilated capillaries lacking structural support The lesions are prone to rupture resulting in seizures or hemorrhagic stroke CCM can occur sporadically manifesting as solitary lesions but also in families where multiple lesions generally occur Familial cases follow inheritance due to mutations in one of three genes or The difference in lesion burden between familial and sporadic CCM combined with limited molecular data suggests that CCM pathogenesis may follow a molecular mechanism similar to that seen for tumor suppressor genes In this study we investigate the hypothesis for CCM pathogenesis Through repeated cycles of amplification subcloning and sequencing of multiple clones per amplicon we identify somatic mutations that are otherwise invisible by direct sequencing of the bulk amplicon Biallelic germline and somatic mutations were identified in CCM lesions from all three forms of inherited CCMs The somatic mutations are found only in a subset of the endothelial cells lining the cavernous vessels and not in interstitial lesion cells These data suggest that CCM lesion genesis requires complete loss of function for one of the CCM genes Although widely expressed in the different cell types of the brain these data also suggest a unique role for the CCM proteins in endothelial cell biology View details for DOI View details for Web of Science ID 000263409100011 View details for PubMedID 19088123 View details for

Daadi Steinberg 2009 4 2 Abstract Demographic trends particularly those related to longer life expectancy suggest that the demand for tissue and organ transplants will further increase since many disorders result from degeneration injury or organ failure The most urgent problem in transplantation medicine is the shortage or lack of suitable donor organs and tissue leading to ethical and societal problems such as organ trafficking The discovery of stem cells in the inner cell mass of developing embryos and in adult tissue has revolutionized the medical field by introducing new therapeutic dimensions to consider for previously untreatable diseases and injuries The unlimited ability and pluripotent capacity to become any cell type of the organism make human embryonic stem cells hESCs a compelling source of cells to study tissue histogenesis and to apply in a wide array of tissue engineering cell transplantation therapy and drug discovery applications In this article we

of inhibition against stroke in rats BRAIN RESEARCH Castaneda Zhao Steinberg 2009 1251 Abstract Two pathways that have been shown to mediate cerebral ischemic damage are the cascade and the deltaPKC pathway We investigated the relationship between these pathways in a rat model of focal ischemia by observing and modifying the activation state of each pathway The inhibitor U0126 injected at ischemia onset attenuated the increase in phosphorylated after reperfusion The deltaPKC inhibitor delivered at reperfusion did not significantly change levels In contrast the deltaPKC activator psi deltaRACK injected at reperfusion reduced phosphorylation measured 4 h after reperfusion Additionally U0126 pretreatment at ischemia onset reduced infarct size compared with vehicle but U0126 injected at the onset of reperfusion had no protection Finally combination of U0126 injection at ischemia onset plus injection at reperfusion further reduced infarct size while combination of U0126 delivered at ischemia onset with psi deltaRACK injected at reperfusion increased infarct size compared with U0126 alone In conclusion we find that inhibiting both the and the deltaPKC pathways offers greater

syngeneic model of neural transplantation to explore communications that enhance cellular medial ganglionic eminence MGE cells were derived from transgenic rat embryos carrying green fluorescent

into four sites along the axis and medially to the stroke in the penumbra zone Control groups included vehicle and fibroblast transplants Animals were subjected to motor behavioral tests at 4 week posttransplant survival time Morphological analysis demonstrated that the grafted MGE cells differentiated into multiple neuronal subtypes established synaptic contact with host cells increased the expression of synaptic markers and enhanced axonal reorganization in the injured area Initial recording demonstrated that the MGE cells received postsynaptic currents from host cells Behavioral analysis showed reduced motor deficits in the rotarod and elevated body swing tests These findings suggest that interactions influence the fate of grafted neural precursors and that functional

Andres Choi Steinberg Guzman 2008 3 6 Abstract Despite therapy clinical outcome after stroke remains poor with many patients left permanently disabled and dependent on care Stem cell therapy has evolved as a promising new therapeutic avenue for the treatment of stroke in experimental studies and recent clinical trials have proven its feasibility and safety in patients Replacement of damaged cells and restoration of function can be accomplished by transplantation of different cell types such as embryonic fetal or adult stem cells human fetal tissue and genetically engineered cell lines Adult neural stem cells offer the advantage of avoiding the ethical problems associated with embryonic or fetal stem cells and can be harvested as autologous grafts from the individual patients Furthermore stimulation of endogenous adult stem repair mechanisms in the brain might offer new avenues for stroke therapy without the necessity of transplantation However important scientific issues need to be addressed to advance our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the critical steps in repair to allow the introduction of these experimental techniques into clinical practice

epsilon PKC confers acute tolerance to cerebral ischemic reperfusion injury NEUROSCIENCE LETTERS Bright Sun Yenari Steinberg 2008 441 1 Abstract In response to mild ischemic stress the brain elicits endogenous survival mechanisms to protect cells against a subsequent lethal ischemic stress referred to as ischemic tolerance The molecular signals that mediate this protection are thought to involve the expression and activation of multiple kinases including protein kinase C PKC Here we demonstrate that epsilonPKC mediates cerebral ischemic tolerance in vivo Systemic delivery of psiepsilonRACK an peptide activator confers neuroprotection against a subsequent cerebral ischemic event when delivered immediately prior to stroke In addition activation of epsilonPKC by psiepsilonRACK treatment decreases vascular tone in vivo as demonstrated by a reduction in microvascular cerebral blood flow Here we demonstrate the role of acute and transient epsilonPKC in early cerebral tolerance in vivo

subjected to 2 h middle cerebral artery occlusion with 2 h intraischemic mild hypothermia 33 degrees C were assayed for Fas FasL and expression Ischemia increased Fas but decreased FasL by approximately at 6 and 24 h Mild hypothermia significantly reduced expression of Fas and processed both by approximately 50 but prevented FasL decreases Fractionation revealed that FasL sFasL was decreased by hypothermia while FasL mFasL increased To more directly assess the significance of the pathway in ischemic stroke primary neuron cultures were exposed to oxygen glucose deprivation Since FasL is cleaved by matrix metalloproteinases MMPs and mild hypothermia decreases MMP expression treatment with a inhibitor also decreased sFasL Thus mild hypothermia is associated with reduced Fas expression and activation Hypothermia prevented total FasL decreases and most of it remained These findings reveal new observations regarding the effect of mild hypothermia on the and MMP systems View

2008 86 8 Abstract Extracellular kinase one of the members of the protein kinase MAPK family mediates a range of activity from metabolism motility and inflammation to cell death and survival It is phosphorylated and activated through a MEK mode via cell surface receptors stimulated by growth factors or cytokines The phosphorylated level is usually increased after cerebral but whether an increase in phosphorylation is protective or detrimental is highly debatable Much of the support for role as a neuroprotectant against stroke stems from its apparent involvement in the beneficial effects of growth factors estrogen preconditioning and hypothermia on the ischemic brain Conversely evidence supporting the detrimental effects of activity is derived from its activation promoting inflammation and oxidative stress and its inhibition reducing ischemic damage The dual potential of actions in the ischemic brain is likely related to its responses to a diverse array of agonists and cell surface receptors Plausibly the activity generated by cytokines and free radicals or other inflammatory factors after stroke may worsen ischemic damage whereas the activity produced by exogenous growth factors estrogen and preconditioning favors neuroprotection Future experiments should be conducted to optimize the protective effect of while blocking its detrimental actions View details for

involving the Akt protein kinase MAPK and protein kinase C PKC signaling pathways reduced infarct and improved behavioral function assessed 30 days after stroke Additionally postconditioning increased levels of phosphorylated Akt Ser473 as measured by western blot and Akt activity as measured by an in vitro kinase assay Inhibiting Akt activity by a phosphoinositide inhibitor LY294002 enlarged infarct in postconditioned rats Postconditioning did not affect protein levels of and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome 10 or protein molecules upstream of Akt but did inhibit an increase in synthase kinase 3beta an Akt effector In addition postconditioning blocked phosphorylation subsequent to glycogen synthase kinase but had no effect on total or active protein levels Furthermore postconditioning inhibited increases in the amount of kinase and extracellular kinase in the MAPK pathway Finally postconditioning blocked deltaPKC cleavage and attenuated reduction in phosphorylation

research on the cognitive effects of the disorder in adults has been limited in scope and generalizability only a few case studies have been published The current study was intended to more comprehensively document the nature of cognitive impairment in moyamoya disease by assessing a large number of adult cases with a neuropsychological assessment test adult patients with neurodiagnostically confirmed moyamoya disease were given presurgical neuropsychological group performances were within normal limits for all measures assessed The highest rate of impairment was for measures of executive functioning The lowest rates occurred with memory and perception measures Cognitive impairment was present in 11 31 of the patients it was judged to be moderate to severe in four patients 11 Five patients reported a mild level of depression and two patients reported a moderate present findings suggest that moyamoya disease diagnosed in adults can impair cognition but that the effect is not as severe as in pediatric cases Executive functioning is most affected Memory and to a large extent intellect are spared The current pattern of results suggests brain correlations that

with CD49d cells showed a significantly better behavioral recovery as compared with CD49d and show that enrichment of NSCs by fluorescence activated cell sorting for the surface integrin CD49d and

Alzheimer patients However whether degradation is involved in brain injury is unknown Here we studied activities of GSK 3beta and and the protective effect of moderate hypothermia 30 degrees C on these activities after focal ischemia in rats The results of Western blot showed that GSK 3beta was dephosphorylated at 5 and 24 h after stroke in the normothermic 37 degrees C brain hypothermia augmented GSK 3beta dephosphorylation Because hypothermia reduces infarction these results contradict with previous studies showing that GSK 3beta dephosphorylation worsens neuronal death Nevertheless hypothermia blocked degradation of total GSK 3beta protein Corresponding to GSK 3beta activity in normothermic rats phosphorylation transiently increased at 5 h in both the ischemic penumbra and core and the total protein level of degraded after normothermic stroke Hypothermia did not inhibit phosphorylation but it blocked degradation in the ischemic penumbra In conclusion moderate hypothermia can

Palmer Steinberg 2008 86 4 Abstract Endogenous neural stem cells normally reside in their niche the subventricular zone in the uninjured rodent brain Upon stroke these cells become more proliferative and migrate away from the subventricular zone into the surrounding parenchyma It is not known whether this behavior is due to changes in the niche or introduction of attractive cues in the infarct zone or both A related question is how transplanted neural stem cells respond to subsequent insults including whether exogenous stem cells have the plasticity to respond to subsequent injuries after engraftment We addressed this issue by transplanting neural progenitor cells NPCs into the uninjured brain and then subjecting the animal to stroke We were able to follow the transplanted NPCs in vivo by labeling them with superparamagnetic iron oxide particles and imaging them via magnetic resonance imaging MRI during engraftment and subsequent to stroke We find that transplanted NPCs that are latent can be activated in response to stroke and exhibit directional migration into the parenchyma similar to endogenous neural NPCs without a niche environment View details for DOI View details for

utilizing various neuroprotective drugs Replacement of damaged cells and restoration of function can be accomplished by transplantation of cells derived from different sources such as embryonic or

populations of human neural stem cells hNSCs Studies have indicated that the direct enrichment method generates a heterogeneous population of cells that may contain residual undifferentiated stem cells that could lead to tumor formation in isolated an expandable and homogenous population of hNSCs named SD56 from hESCs using a defined media supplemented with epidermal growth factor EGF basic fibroblast growth factor bFGF and leukemia inhibitory growth factor LIF These hNSCs grew as an adherent monolayer culture They were fully neuralized and uniformly expressed molecular features of NSCs including nestin vimentin and radial glial markers These hNSCs did not express the pluripotency markers Oct4 or Nanog nor did they express markers for the mesoderm or endoderm lineages The property of the hNSCs was characterized by a predominant symmetrical mode of cell division The SD56 hNSCs differentiated into neurons astrocytes and oligodendrocytes throughout multiple passages in vitro as well as after transplantation Together these criteria confirm the definitive NSC identity of the SD56 cell line Importantly they exhibited no chromosome abnormalities and did not form tumors after implantation into rat ischemic brains and into naïve nude rat brains and flanks Furthermore hNSCs isolated under these conditions migrated toward the adult brain parenchyma and improved the independent use of the forelimb two months SD56 human neural stem cells derived under the reported conditions are stable do not form tumors in vivo and enable functional recovery after stroke These

15 min occlusion followed with the same period of reperfusion of the left hind femoral artery and repeated for two or three cycles Infarct was measured 2 days later The results showed that rapid preconditioning with three cycles of 15 min performed immediately before stroke reduced infarct size from of control ischemia to at two cycles of 15 min infarct was reduced to at two cycles of 5 min infarct was not reduced Delayed preconditioning with three cycles of 15 min conducted 2 days before stroke also reduced infarct to but with two cycles of 15 min it offered no protection The protective effects at these two therapeutic time windows of remote preconditioning are consistent with those of conventional preconditioning in which the preconditioning ischemia is induced in the brain itself Unexpectedly intermediate preconditioning with three cycles of 15 min performed 12 h before stroke also reduced infarct to which contradicts the current dogma for therapeutic time windows for the conventional preconditioning that has no protection at this time point In conclusion remote preconditioning performed in one limb protected against ischemic damage after focal cerebral ischemia View

embolization using liquid embolic agents AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY Jayaraman Marcellus Hamilton Do Campbell Chang Steinberg Marks 2008 29 2 Abstract Embolization of arteriovenous malformations AVMs is commonly used to achieve nidal volume reduction before microsurgical resection or stereotactic radiosurgery The purpose of this study was to examine the overall neurologic complication rate in patients undergoing AVM embolization and analyze the factors that may determine increased performed a retrospective review of all patients with brain AVMs embolized at 1 center from 1995 through 2005 Demographics including age sex presenting symptoms and clinical condition were recorded Angiographic factors including maximal nidal size presence of deep venous drainage and involvement of eloquent cortex were also recorded For each embolization session the agent used number of pedicles embolized the percentage of nidal obliteration and any complications were recorded Complications were classified as the following none mild transient neurologic deficit and permanent nondisabling and permanent disabling deficits The permanent complications were also classified as ischemic or hemorrhagic Modified Rankin Scale mRS scores were collected and postembolization on all patients Univariate regression analysis of factors associated with the development of any neurologic complication was hundred embolization procedures were performed in 192 patients There were 6 grade I 26 grade II 71 grade III 57 grade IV and 32 grade V AVMs Permanent nondisabling complications occurred in 5 patients and permanent disabling complications or deaths occurred in 3 In addition there were complications in 4 patients and transient neurologic deficits in 22 Five of the 8 permanent complications overall were ischemic and 3 of 8 overall were hemorrhagic Of the 178 patients who were mRS 4 were dependent or dead mRS 2 at Univariate analysis of risk factors for permanent neurologic deficits following embolization showed that basal ganglia location was weakly associated with a new postembolization neurologic of brain AVMs can be performed with a high degree of technical success

Abstract Neurosurgical interventions for moyamoya disease MMD in pediatric patients include direct indirect and combined revascularization procedures Each technique has shown efficacy in the treatment of pediatric MMD however no single study has demonstrated the superiority of one technique over another In this review the authors explore the various studies focused on the use of these techniques for MMD in the pediatric population They summarize the results of each study to clearly depict the clinical outcomes achieved at each institution that had utilized direct indirect or combined techniques In certain studies multiple techniques were used and the clinical or radiological outcomes were compared accordingly Direct techniques have been shown to aid a reduction in perioperative strokes and provide immediate revascularization to ischemic areas however these procedures are technically challenging and not all pediatric patients are appropriate candidates Indirect techniques have also shown efficacy in the pediatric population but may require a longer period for revascularization to occur and perfusion deficits to be reversed The authors concluded that the clinical efficacy of one technique over another is still unclear as most studies have had small populations and the same outcome measures have not been applied Authors who compared direct and indirect techniques noted approximately equal clinical outcomes with differences in radiological findings Additional larger studies are needed to determine the advantages and disadvantages of the different techniques for the pediatric age group View details for DOI View details for Web of Science ID 000256268400018 View details for PubMedID 18275292 Progressive cerebral vascular degeneration with

encephalopathy with lactic acidosis and episodes is a maternally inherited disorder characterized by recurrent cerebral infarctions that do not conform to discreet vascular territories Here we report on a patient who presented at 7 years of age with loss of consciousness and severe metabolic acidosis following vomiting and dehydration She developed progressive sensorineural hearing loss myopathy ptosis short stature and mild developmental delays after normal early development Biochemical testing identified metabolites characteristic of dehydrogenase MCAD deficiency hexanoylglycine and suberylglycine but also severe lactic acidemia mM and in urine excess of lactic acid intermediates of the citric cycle and marked ketonuria suggesting mitochondrial dysfunction She progressed rapidly to develop temporary cortical blindness Brain imaging indicated generalized atrophy more marked on the left side in addition to white matter alterations consistent with a mitochondrial disorder Magnetic resonance angiography indicated occlusion of the left cerebral artery with development of collateral circulation Moyamoya syndrome This process worsened over time to involve the other side of the brain A muscle biopsy indicated the presence of numerous ragged red fibers Molecular testing confirmed compound heterozygosity for the common mutation in the MCAD gene 985A G and a second pathogenic mutation 233T C MtDNA testing indicated that the muscle was almost homoplasmic for the 3243A T mutation in tRNALeu with a lower mutant load about 50 heteroplasmy in blood and skin

hypothermia in attenuating cerebral ischemic damage JOURNAL OF CEREBRAL BLOOD FLOW AND METABOLISM Zhao Steinberg Sapolsky 2007 27 12 Abstract Mild or moderate hypothermia is generally thought to block all changes in signaling events that are detrimental to ischemic brain including ATP depletion glutamate release Ca mobilization anoxic depolarization free radical generation inflammation barrier permeability necrotic and apoptotic pathways However the effects and mechanisms of hypothermia are in fact variable We emphasize that even in the laboratory hypothermic protection is limited In certain models of permanent focal ischemia hypothermia may not protect at all In cases where hypothermia reduces infarct some studies have overemphasized its ability to maintain cerebral blood flow and ATP levels and to prevent anoxic depolarization glutamate release during ischemia Instead hypothermia may protect against ischemia by regulating cascades that occur after reperfusion including barrier permeability and the changes in gene and protein expressions associated with necrotic and apoptotic pathways Hypothermia not only blocks multiple damaging cascades after stroke but also selectively upregulates some protective genes However most of these mechanisms are addressed in models with intraischemic hypothermia much less information is available in models with postischemic hypothermia Moreover although it has been confirmed that mild hypothermia is clinically feasible for acute focal stroke treatment no definite beneficial effect has been reported yet This lack of clinical protection may result from suboptimal criteria for patient entrance into clinical trials To facilitate clinical translation future efforts in the laboratory should focus more on the protective mechanisms of postischemic hypothermia as well as on the effects of sex age and rewarming during reperfusion on hypothermic protection View details for Web of Science ID 000250957800001

focal ischemia in rats by permanent distal middle cerebral artery MCA occlusion plus transient occlusion of the common carotid arteries CCAs This models a scenario in which the MCA remains occluded but partial reperfusion occurs through collateral vessels The authors also determined whether hypothermia mediates ischemic damage by blocking apoptotic left MCA was occluded permanently and the CCAs were reopened after 2 hours leading to partial reperfusion in rats maintained at 37 degrees C 33 degrees C mild hypothermia or 30 degrees C moderate hypothermia for 2 hours during after CCA occlusion that is for a total of 2 or 4 hours of hypothermia or normothermia Infarct size was measured 2 days after the stroke Immunofluorescence staining and Western blot analysis were used to detect cytochrome c and apoptosis inducing factor AIF hours of prolonged mild hypothermia 33 degrees C reduced the infarct size 22 in the model of permanent MCA occlusion whereas 2 hours of such mild hypothermia maintained either during CCA occlusion or after CCA release did not attenuate ischemic damage However moderate hypothermia 30 degrees C during CCA occlusion was significantly more protective than 4 hours of 33 degrees C 46 decrease in infarct size Four hours of mild or moderate hypothermia reduced cytosolic cytochrome c release and both nuclear and cytosolic AIF translocation

Shimohata Zhao Sung Sun Steinberg 2007 27 8 Abstract Mild hypothermia is a robust neuroprotective treatment for stroke Understanding the mechanisms underlying hypothermia benefits will lead to more effective treatments to prevent stroke damage Delta protein kinase C deltaPKC is a kinase that has been strongly implicated in executing ischemic damage We investigated the effects of hypothermia on deltaPKC activation as determined by its subcellular translocation proteolytic cleavage and phosphorylation in a focal cerebral ischemia model The amount of constitutively activated catalytic fragment of deltaPKC increased after stroke Both hypothermia 30 degrees C and the inhibitor blocked the accumulation of activated deltaPKC in the penumbra Other hallmarks of deltaPKC activation its translocation to the mitochondria and nucleus were observed in the penumbra as early as 10 mins after reperfusion These events were blocked by hypothermia Hypothermia also blocked increases in the mitochondria and nuclei Conversely a specific deltaPKC activator psideltaRACK decreased the neuroprotective effect of hypothermia Finally deltaPKC activity may lead to mitochondrial injury and cytochrome c release as the timing of cytochrome c release corresponded to the time course of deltaPKC translocation Both cytochrome c release and deltaPKC translocation were blocked by hypothermia In

reducing damage following acute ischemic events such as stroke and under chronic stress in diseases such as hypertension Ischemic episodes lead to endothelial cell damage deleterious inflammatory responses and altered neuronal and astrocyte regulation of vascular function These in turn can lead to impaired cerebral blood flow and compromised barrier function promoting microvascular collapse edema hemorrhagic transformation and worsened neurological recovery Multiple studies demonstrate that protein kinase C PKC a widely expressed kinase is involved in mediating arterial tone and microvascular function However there is no clear understanding about the role of individual PKC isozymes We show that intraperitoneal injection of in 1 mL an peptide inhibitor of deltaPKC improved microvascular pathology increased the number of patent microvessels by 92 compared to animals and increased cerebral blood flow by 26 following acute focal ischemia induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion in normotensive rats In addition acute delivery of in hypertensive Dahl rats increased cerebral blood flow by 12 and sustained delivery 5 1 mM reduced infarct size by 25 following an acute stroke induced by MCA occlusion for 90 min Together these findings demonstrate that deltaPKC is an important therapeutic target for protection of microvascular structure and function under both acute

NEUROBIOLOGY Zhao Sapolsky Steinberg 2006 34 3 Abstract In recent years the cell survival signaling pathway has been increasingly researched in the field of stroke Akt activity is suggested to be upregulated by phosphorylation through the activation of receptor tyrosine kinases by growth factors Although the upstream signaling components protein kinase PDK 1 and integrinlinked kinase enhance the activity of Akt phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 PTEN decreases it Upon activation Akt phosphorylates an array of molecules including glycogen synthase kinase3beta GSK3beta forkhead homolog in rhabdomyosarcoma FKHR and death protein thereby blocking mitochondrial cytochrome c release and caspase activity Generally the level of Akt phosphorylation at site Ser 473 transiently increases after focal ischemia whereas the levels of phosphorylation of PTEN PDK1 forkhead transcription factor and GSK3beta decrease Numerous compounds such as growth factors estrogen free radical scavengers and other neuroprotectants reduce ischemic damage possibly by upregulating However preconditioning and hypothermia block ischemic damage by inhibiting an increase of Inhibition of the Akt pathway blocks the protective effect of preconditioning and hypothermia suggesting the Akt pathway contributes to their protective effects and that the level does not represent its true

Hypothermia blocks ischemic changes in ubiquitin distribution and levels following stroke NEUROREPORT Liu Zhao Sung Sun Steinberg 2006 17 16 Abstract Dysfunction of the system has recently been linked

on the distribution of total and free ubiquitin as well as the levels of conjugated ubiquitin after experimental stroke using a focal cerebral ischemia model We show that hypothermia prevents redistribution of ubiquitin following ischemia largely through preservation of intracellular cytoplasmic free ubiquitin We also show that hypothermia blocks the increase in conjugated ubiquitin

Steinberg 2006 26 9 Abstract Cerebral ischemic preconditioning protects against stroke but is clinically feasible only when the occurrence of stroke is predictable Reperfusion plays a critical role in cerebral injury after stroke we tested the hypothesis that interrupting reperfusion lessens ischemic injury We found for the first time that such postconditioning with a series of mechanical interruptions of reperfusion significantly reduces ischemic damage Focal ischemia was generated by permanent distal middle cerebral artery MCA occlusion plus transient bilateral common carotid artery CCA occlusion After 30 secs of CCA reperfusion ischemic postconditioning was performed by occluding CCAs for 10 secs and then allowing for another two cycles of 30 secs of reperfusion and 10 secs of CCA occlusion Infarct size was measured 2 days later Cerebral blood flow CBF was measured in animals subjected to permanent MCA occlusion plus 15 mins of bilateral CCA occlusion which demonstrates that postconditioning disturbed the early hyperemia immediately after reperfusion Postconditioning dose dependently reduced infarct size in animals subjected to permanent MCA occlusion combined with 15 30 and 60 mins of bilateral CCA occlusion by reducing infarct size approximately 80 51 and 17 respectively In addition postconditioning blocked terminal deoxynucleotidyl uridine nick end staining a marker of apoptosis in the penumbra 2 days after stroke Furthermore in situ superoxide detection using hydroethidine suggested that postconditioning attenuated superoxide products during early reperfusion after stroke In conclusion postconditioning reduced infarct size most plausibly by blocking apoptosis and free radical generation With further study it may eventually be clinically

ruptured saccular aneurysms treated 1996 to 1998 After an initial medical record review all patients meeting entry criteria were contacted by postal questionnaire or telephone Possible reruptures were adjudicated independently by a neurologist a neurosurgeon and a neurointerventional radiologist Rates of delayed 1 year and early rerupture and retreatment were evaluated using survival analysis and the total of 1010 patients 711 surgically clipped 299 treated with coil embolization were included Patients treated with coil embolization were older more likely to have smaller aneurysms arising from the posterior circulation and less likely to have middle cerebral artery aneurysms Rerupture of the index aneurysm after 1 year occurred in 1 patient treated with coil embolization during 904 of annual rate and in no patients treated with surgical clipping during 2666 Aneurysm retreatment after 1 year was more frequent in patients treated with coil embolization P but major complications were rare during of aneurysms treated by either coil embolization or surgical clipping is rare after the first year Late retreatment is more common after coil embolization than after clipping but complication rates are low Thus late events are unlikely to overwhelm differences between procedures at View details for DOI View details for Web of Science ID 000237925000029 View details for

Masel Kleppner Schallert Palmer Steinberg 2006 83 6 Abstract Cell transplantation offers a potential new treatment for stroke Animal studies using models that produce ischemic damage in both the striatum and the frontal cortex have shown beneficial effects when hNT cells postmitotic immature neurons were transplanted into the ischemic striatum In this study we investigated the effect of hNT cells in a model of stroke in which the striatum remains intact and damage is restricted to the cortex hNT cells were transplanted into the ischemic cortex 1 week after stroke induced by distal middle cerebral artery occlusion dMCAo The cells exhibited robust survival at 4 weeks posttransplant even at the lesion border hNT cells did not migrate but they did extend long neurites into the surrounding parenchyma mainly through the white matter Neurite extension was predominantly toward the lesion in ischemic animals but was bidirectional in uninjured animals Extension of neurites through the cortex toward the lesion was also seen when there was some surviving cortical tissue between the graft and the infarct Prolonged deficits were obtained in four tests of function animals showed a significant improvement in functional recovery on one motor test but there was no effect on the other three tests relative to control animals Thus despite clear evidence of graft survival and neurite extension the functional benefit of hNT cells after ischemia is not guaranteed Functional benefit could depend on other variables such as infarct location whether the cells mature the behavioral tests employed rehabilitation training or as yet unidentified factors View details for DOI View details for Web of Science ID 000237217100008 View details for PubMedID 16496370 Surgical management of posterior fossa arteriovenous malformations Neurosurgery Sinclair Kelly Steinberg 2006 58 4 201 Abstract Arteriovenous malformations AVMs involving the cerebellum and brainstem are relatively rare lesions that most often present clinically as a result of a hemorrhagic episode Although these AVMs were once thought to have a more aggressive clinical course in comparison with supratentorial AVMs recent autopsy data suggests that there may be little difference in hemorrhage rates between the two locations Although current management of these lesions often involves preoperative embolization and stereotactic radiosurgery surgical resection remains the treatment of choice conferring immediate protection to the patient from the risk of future symptomatic AVMs that involve the cerebellum and the pial or ependymal surfaces of the brainstem are candidates for surgical resection Preoperative angiography and magnetic resonance imaging studies are critical to determine suitability for resection and choice of operative exposure In addition to considering the location of the nidus arterial supply and predominant venous drainage the surgical approach must also be selected with consideration of the small confines of the posterior fossa and eloquence of the brainstem cranial nerves and deep cerebellar the 1980s progressive advances in preoperative embolization frameless stereotaxy and intraoperative electrophysiologic monitoring have significantly improved the number of posterior fossa AVMs amenable to microsurgical resection with minimal morbidity and improvements in endovascular technology and stereotactic radiosurgery will likely continue to increase the number of posterior fossa AVMs that can safely be removed and further improve the clinical outcomes associated with microsurgical

one of the most devastating sequelae and the most common cause of delayed ischemic neurological deficit DIND Because vasospasm also is the most common cause of morbidity and mortality in patients who survive the initial bleeding episode it is imperative not only to diagnose the condition but also to predict which patients are likely to become symptomatic The exact pathophysiology of vasospasm is complex and incompletely elucidated Early recognition of vasospasm is essential because the timely use of several therapeutic interventions can counteract this disease and prevent the occurrence of DIND However the prompt implementation of these therapies depends on the ability to predict impending vasospasm or to diagnose it at its early stages A number of techniques have been developed during the past several decades to evaluate cerebral perfusion including positron emission tomography computed tomography emission computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging and perfusion computed tomography In this article the authors provide a general overview of the currently available perfusion imaging techniques and their applications in treating vasospasm after a patient has suffered a subarachnoid hemorrhage The use of cerebral perfusion imaging techniques for the early detection of vasospasm is becoming more common and may provide opportunities for early therapeutic intervention

Neurosurgical focus Polevaya Kalani Steinberg Tse 2006 20 6 Abstract The description of cerebral aneurysms dates back to antiquity Little was known however about the pathological mechanisms of aneurysm formation and treatment options for this disease until 200 years ago The modern era of aneurysm treatment began with the hunterian ligation of the proximal artery followed by clip and coil occlusion In this article the authors describe the transition from conservative therapy to internal carotid artery ICA ligation and gradual occlusion of the ICA to the direct placement of clips on aneurysms The driving forces and rationale behind each major advancement are summarized and the authors attempt to predict what these innovations mean for the future of intracranial aneurysm

JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE Zhao Shimohata Wang Sun Schaal Sapolsky Steinberg 2005 25 42 Abstract Activation of the kinase B PKB kinase pathway can be neuroprotective after stroke Akt is activated by growth factors via a pathway involving the kinases phosphoinositide 3 PI3 kinase and protein PDK1 and is negatively regulated by phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 PTEN Akt kinase blocks apoptosis by phosphorylating the substrates forkhead transcription factor FKHR and glycogen synthase kinase 3beta GSK3beta We found that hypothermia 30 degrees C reduced infarct size and improved functional outcomes up to 2 months Changes in phosphorylation levels of Akt as measured by Western blots and immunostaining differed from levels of Akt activity measured in an in vitro assay in normothermic animals Hypothermia blocked most of these changes and maintained Akt activity Inhibition of enlarged infarct size in hypothermic animals Hypothermia improved phosphorylation of PDK1 PTEN and FKHR Hypothermia did not improve GSK3beta Ser9 phosphorylation but blocked the nuclear translocation of phosphorylated downstream of GSK3beta Phosphorylation levels of PTEN Akt and Akt substrate decreased before apoptotic cytochrome c release and degradation of a marker of neuronal survival Hypothermia may protect from ischemic damage in part by preserving Akt activity and attenuating the apoptotic effects of PTEN PDK1 and FKHR View details for DOI View details for Web of Science ID 000232669300024 View details for PubMedID 16237183 Visual field preservation after

inhibition by hypothermia JOURNAL OF CEREBRAL BLOOD FLOW AND METABOLISM Zhao Yenari Cheng Sapolsky Steinberg 2005 25 9 Abstract Hypothermia is effective in preventing ischemic damage A apoptotic pathway is involved in ischemic damage but how hypothermia inhibits this pathway after global cerebral ischemia has not been well explored It was determined whether hypothermia protects the brain by altering cytochrome c release and caspase activity Cerebral ischemia was produced by occlusion plus hypotension for 10 mins Body temperature in hypothermic animals was reduced to 33 degrees C before ischemia onset and maintained for 3 h after reperfusion Western blots of subcellular fractions revealed biphasic cytosolic cytochrome c release with an initial peak at about 5 h after ischemia which decreased at 12 to 24 h and a second larger peak at 48 and activity increased at 12 and 24 A caspase inhibitor administered 5 and 24 h after ischemia onset protected hippocampal CA1 neurons from injury and blocked the second cytochrome c peak suggesting that caspases mediate this second phase Hypothermia 33 degrees C which prevented CA1 injury did not inhibit cytochrome c release at 5 h but reduced cytochrome c release at 48 and activity was markedly attenuated by hypothermia at 12 and 24 Thus biphasic cytochrome c release occurs after transient global ischemia and mild hypothermia protects against ischemic damage by blocking the second phase of cytochrome c release possibly by blocking caspase activity View details for DOI View details for Web of Science ID 000231576100003 View

transplantation followed by participation in a stroke rehabilitation program compared with rehabilitation alone in patients with substantial fixed motor deficits associated with a basal ganglia neuronal cells Layton BioScience were delivered frozen and then thawed and formulated on the morning of surgery The entry criteria in this randomized trial of 18 patients included age between 18 and 75 years completed stroke duration of 1 to 6 years presence of a fixed motor deficit that was stable for at least 2 months and no contraindications to stereotactic surgery Patients were randomized at two centers to receive either 5 or 10 million implanted cells in 25 sites seven patients per group followed by participation in a stroke rehabilitation program or to serve as a nonsurgical control group rehabilitation only four patients The surgical techniques used were the same at both centers All patients underwent extensive and postoperative motor testing and imaging Patients received cyclosporine A for 1 week before and 6 months after surgery The primary efficacy measure was a change in the European Stroke Scale ESS motor score at 6 months Secondary outcomes included Action Research Arm Test and Stroke Impact Scale scores as well as the results of other motor tests Nine strokes were ischemic in origin and nine were hemorrhagic All 14 patients who underwent surgery ages years underwent uncomplicated surgeries Serial evaluations maximum duration 24 months demonstrated no adverse serological or effects One patient suffered a single seizure another had a syncopal event and in another there was drainage of an asymptomatic chronic subdural hematoma Four of seven patients who received 5 million cells mean improvement points and two of seven who received 10 million cells had improved ESS scores at 6 months however there was no significant change in the ESS motor score in patients who received cell implants p compared with control or baseline values p Compared

specifically expressed on the endothelial cells of central nervous system CNS neoplasms However no data exist on the expression of alphavbeta3 in vascular malformations of the CNS In this study we investigate the expression of alphavbeta3 in arteriovenous malformations AVMs and cavernous malformations CMs samples of AVMs from 12 patients and CMs from 5 patients were obtained intraoperatively Once the final pathology had been confirmed immunohistochemistry was performed using an antibody to the integrin alphavbeta3 The alphavbeta3 expression pattern was graded according to the percentage of positively staining of 12 AVMs demonstrated alphavbeta3 immunopositivity Six of these 10 AVMs had moderate or strong staining Most notably 5 of the 6 moderate or strongly staining AVMs came from patients 22 years of age or younger Four of these 6 AVMs had previously been embolized None of the cavernous malformations demonstrated alphavbeta3 may contribute to the formation of AVMs in younger patients alphavbeta3 may also provide a potential therapeutic target The lack of alphavbeta3 expression in cavernous malformations despite their high vascular densities suggests that the

Abstract We characterize the survival migration and differentiation of human neurospheres derived from CNS stem cells transplanted into the ischemic cortex of rats 7 days after distal middle cerebral artery occlusion Transplanted neurospheres survived robustly in naive and ischemic brains 4 wk posttransplant Survival was influenced by proximity of the graft to the stroke lesion and was negatively correlated with the number of inflammatory cells Targeted migration of the human cells was seen in ischemic animals with many human cells migrating long distances approximately mm predominantly toward the lesion in naive rats cells migrated radially from the injection site in smaller number and over shorter distances mm The majority of migrating cells in ischemic rats had a neuronal phenotype Migrating cells between the graft and the lesion expressed the neuroblast marker doublecortin whereas human cells at the lesion border expressed the immature neuronal marker although a small percentage of cells at the lesion border also expressed glial fibrillary acid protein GFAP Thus transplanted human CNS hCNS neurospheres survived robustly in naive and ischemic brains and the

deltaPKC activity Delivery of decreased infarct size in an in vivo rat stroke model of transient middle cerebral artery occlusion Importantly had no effect when delivered immediately before ischemia However delivery at the onset at 1 hr or at 6 hr of reperfusion reduced injury by 68 47 and 58 respectively Previous work has implicated deltaPKC in mediating apoptotic processes We therefore determined whether deltaPKC inhibition altered apoptotic cell death or cell survival pathways in our models We found that reduced numbers of terminal deoxynucleotidyl biotinylated UTP nick end cells indicating decreased apoptosis increased levels of a kinase involved in cell survival pathways and inhibited BAD death protein protein translocation from the cell cytosol to the membrane indicating inhibition of proapoptotic signaling These data support a deleterious role for deltaPKC during reperfusion and suggest that delivery even hours after commencement of reperfusion may provide a

Giffard Xu Heng Carrico Ouyang Y Qiao Sapolsky Steinberg Hu Yenari A 2004 207 18 Abstract Chaperones especially the stress inducible Hsp70 have been studied for their potential to protect the brain from ischemic injury While they protect from both global and focal ischemia in vivo and cell culture models of injury in vitro the mechanism of protection is not well understood Protein aggregation is part of the etiology of chronic neurodegenerative diseases such as Huntington and Alzheimer and recent data demonstrate protein aggregates in animal models of stroke We now demonstrate that overexpression of Hsp70 in hippocampal CA1 neurons reduces evidence of protein aggregation under conditions where neuronal survival is increased We have also demonstrated protection by the cochaperone in vitro and demonstrated that this is associated with reduced protein aggregation identified by ubiquitin immunostaining can prevent protein aggregate formation by itself but can only facilitate protein folding in conjunction with Hsp70 Pharmacological induction of Hsp70 was found to reduce both apoptotic and necrotic astrocyte death induced by glucose deprivation or oxygen glucose deprivation Protection from ischemia and injury by chaperones thus involves at least and aggregation mechanisms View details for DOI View details for Web of Science ID 000224132000014 View details for

Sun Cheng Qiao Luo Martin Steinberg Harrison Yenari A 2004 188 2 Abstract The kinase glycogen synthase kinase 3beta GSK3beta is abundant in CNS and is neuron specific GSK3beta plays a pivotal role in the regulation of numerous cellular functions GSK3beta phosphorylates and thereby regulates many metabolic signaling and structural proteins which can influence cell survival Increased GSK3beta correlates with increased cell death whereas reduced GSK3beta expression correlates with increased cell survival We report that the GSK3beta inhibitor Chir025 is neuroprotective in vitro and in vivo First Chir025 reduced cultured hippocampal neuron death following glutamate exposure by versus controls Second Chir025 significantly reduced cultured cortical neuron death following deprivation OGD by approximately 50 Third Chir025 reduced infarct size following focal cerebral ischemia by nearly 20 There were no significant differences in the number of neurons or in and activities between and rats although Chir025 elevated cytosolic expression These data show that inhibition of GSK3beta is neuroprotective and that the mechanism is probably not View details for DOI View details for PubMedID

craniotomy for repair of an unruptured cerebral aneurysm n 153 were randomly assigned to undergo hypothermia to 33 degrees C either with an endovascular cooling device placed in the inferior vena cava via the femoral vein n 92 or with a surface convective air blanket n 61 Active rewarming was accomplished using the same rates in endovascular and surface blanket groups averaged and degrees respectively P When the first temporary arterial or aneurysm clip was placed 99 of endovascular patients and 20 of surface blanket patients had reached the target of 33 degrees C P Obese patients were cooled efficiently with the endovascular approach degrees Rewarming rates averaged degrees for endovascular patients and degrees for surface blanket patients P By the end of surgery 89 and 53 of these patients respectively had rewarmed to at least 35 degrees C P On leaving the operating room 14 of endovascular patients and 28 of surface blanket patients were still intubated P The overall safety of the two procedures was comparable No clinically significant thrombotic bleeding or infectious complications were reported in the endovascular cooling provided superior induction maintenance and reversal of hypothermia compared with the surface blanket without an increase in complications Endovascular cooling may have clinical benefit for patients undergoing cerebrovascular surgery as well as

stroke Cytochrome c release and activation of various caspases are known to occur after focal and global ischemia However recent reports indicate that pathways may also be involved in ischemic damage factor AIF is a novel flavoprotein that helps mediate apoptotic cell death AIF translocates from mitochondria to nuclei where it induces DNA fragmentation a mitochondrial membrane protein protects against apoptotic and necrotic death induced by different insults including cerebral ischemia In the present study Western blots confirmed that AIF was normally confined to mitochondria but translocated to nuclei or cytosol 8 24 and 48 hours after onset of ischemia Overall AIF protein levels also increased after stroke Confocal microscopy further demonstrated that nuclear AIF translocation occurred in the region but not in the ischemic core where only some cytosolic AIF release was observed Our data also suggest that AIF translocated into nuclei after cytochrome c was released into the cytosol transfection in the region blocked nuclear AIF translocation and improved cortical neuron survival View details for Web of Science ID 000221824000011 View details for

monitoring NPM techniques in the detection of ischemic changes that may be seen during endovascular treatment of cerebral patients underwent NPM during endovascular treatment of cerebral aneurysms The patients underwent a total of 50 endovascular procedures including balloon test occlusion 19 patients GDC embolization 22 patients and permanent vessel occlusion nine patients NPM included electroencephalography somatosensory evoked potentials brain stem auditory evoked potentials depending on the location of the changes were seen in nine 26 of 35 patients and altered the management in five 14 of 35 patients In three of the five cases NPM changes were observed without corresponding neurologic physical examination changes after balloon test occlusion performed while the patients were under general anesthesia in two cases In the two other cases in which NPM changes altered management ischemia was detected at the time of therapy while the patients were under general anesthesia Overall 18 of 35 patients underwent a total of 19 balloon test occlusion procedures Of the 17 remaining patients 13 underwent aneurysm coiling two were not treated because of inability to safely place coils and two were treated for distal aneurysms Two patients developed transient neurologic deficits without concurrent NPM changes representing NPM test is a valuable adjunct to endovascular

through linkage analysis and mutation screening The authors collected blood samples from 68 patients with familial CCM and 138 patients with apparently sporadic CCM as well as from their families in an effort to characterize the prevalence and spectrum of sequence variants in the KRIT1 authors used conformational polymorphism analysis to identify genomic variants in KRIT1 which were sequenced to determine the specific mutation Among 43 kindreds who immigrated to the southwestern US from northern Mexico 31 share an identical founder mutation This Q455X mutation is found in 18 86 of 21 persons with a positive family history and in 13 59 of 22 persons with apparently sporadic CCM This mutation was not found among 13 persons with CCM who were recruited from Mexico These findings establish the key role of a recent founder mutation in Hispanic persons with CCM who live in the US Although nearly all Hispanic families in the US in which there are multiple CCM cases linked to the CCM1 locus only 13 of 25 families have displayed evidence of linkage to the CCM1 locus Among these 13 families the authors identified eight independent mutations in nine kindreds They identified four additional mutations among 22 familial CCM kindreds with no linkage information bringing the total number of independent mutations to 12 Inherited KRIT1 mutations were not detected among 103 persons in whom a family history of CCM was rigorously mutations were nonsense mutations mutations predicting premature termination or mutations located throughout the KRIT1 gene suggesting that these are genetic

study the authors examined the influence of mild hypothermia on early expression of nitric oxide synthase NOS isoforms and peroxynitrite generation after experimental 82 male rats middle cerebral artery occlusion was performed for 2 hours by using the intraluminal suture model The rats were maintained at their normal body temperature or exposed to 2 hours of intraischemic or postischemic delay mild hypothermia Brains were collected 2 6 and 24 hours after onset of ischemia for immunohistochemical and Western blot analysis of neuronal n NOS and inducible i NOS expression and peroxynitrite blots showed significantly increased nNOS and iNOS expression in the ischemic cortex at 2 6 and 24 hours compared with animals The NOS expression was highest at 24 hours Postischemic hypothermia attenuated nNOS expression at 6 and 24 hours to a greater extent than intraischemic hypothermia Intraischemic hypothermia reduced iNOS expression at both 2 and 24 hours whereas postischemic hypothermia decreased iNOS expression at 24 hours Results of immunohistochemical studies showed that nNOS colocalized with the neuronal marker at all time points whereas iNOS was initially localized to vessels and then localized to activated microglia by 24 hours Intraischemic but not postischemic hypothermia decreased the number of cells in the ischemic cortex at 24 hours Mild hypothermia significantly but differentially attenuates increases in NOS isoforms with more robust nNOS suppression when cooling is delayed This may have important implications for understanding the mechanism of

the vertebral artery for vertebrobasilar fusiform and dissecting consecutive patients were studied Two groups were defined for the study Group I patients underwent PVO to achieve complete thrombosis of the aneurysm Group II patients underwent PVO to reduce flow to the aneurysm where complete thrombosis was not desirable Modified Rankin scores were obtained at presentation and at range months mean months group I aneurysms were shown to be thrombosed on the angiograms obtained at the immediate examinations Improvement in outcome scores was achieved by all group I patients Improvement in Rankin scores after endovascular treatment was statistically significant P All group II patients had complete occlusion of the vertebral artery however continued filling of the fusiform aneurysm was still observed Four patients in group II died during the period Two of these deaths were attributable to the aneurysms Of the remaining three patients two experienced clinical worsening and one remained this series PVO for chronic fusiform and acute dissecting aneurysms of the vertebrobasilar system proved to be a useful therapeutic endovascular technique outcomes suggest that patients with aneurysms

and others have previously demonstrated that defective herpes simplex virus vectors expressing protect against various insults in vitro and in vivo including cerebral ischemia Because the infarct margin may be a region that is most amenable to treatment we first determined whether gene transfer to the infarct margin is possible using a focal ischemia model Since ischemic injury with and without reperfusion may occur by different mechanisms we also determined whether protects against focal cerebral ischemic injury either with or without reperfusion in rats Bax expression cytochrome c translocation and activated expression were also assessed Viral vectors overexpressing were delivered to the infarct margin Reperfusion resulted in larger infarcts than permanent occlusion overexpression significantly improved neuron survival in both ischemia models overexpression did not alter overall Bax expression but inhibited cytosolic accumulation of cytochrome c and activation Thus we provide the first evidence that gene transfer to the infarct margin is feasible that overexpression of protects against damage to the infarct margin induced by ischemia with and without reperfusion and that overexpression using gene therapy attenuates proteins This suggests a potential therapeutic strategy for stroke View details for DOI View details for Web of Science ID

protective genes to neurons Using this system in experimental models of stroke cardiac arrest and excitotoxicity we found that it is possible to enhance neuron survival against such cerebral insults by overexpressing genes that target various facets of injury Among the genes we studied the protein improved neuron survival following various insults and was protective even when administered after stroke onset is thought to protect cells from apoptotic death by preventing cytochrome c release from the mitochondria and subsequent caspase activation We and others have established that cooling the brain by a few degrees markedly reduces ischemic injury and improves neurologic deficits in models of cerebral ischemia and trauma This hypothermic neuroprotection is also associated with upregulation in some instances Furthermore hypothermia suppresses many aspects of apoptotic death including cytochrome c release caspase activation and DNA fragmentation Here we show that two different kinds of protective therapies overexpression and hypothermia both inhibit aspects of apoptotic cell death cascades and that a combination treatment can prolong the temporal therapeutic window for gene therapy

in free radical FR production within the first min of reperfusion and again at the peak of the inflammatory process Hypothermia decreases lipid peroxidation following global ischemia raising the possibility that it may act by reducing FR production early on and by maintaining or increasing endogenous antioxidant systems By means of FR fluorescence Western blot immunohistochemistry and enzymatic assay we studied the effects of mild hypothermia on superoxide O 2 anion production superoxide dismutase SOD expression and activity following focal cerebral ischemia in rats Mild hypothermia significantly reduced O 2 generation in the ischemic penumbra and corresponding contralateral region but did not alter the bilateral SOD expression SOD enzymatic activity in the ischemic core was slightly reduced in animals compared with normothermic controls Our results suggest that the neuroprotective effect of mild hypothermia may be due in part to a reduction in neuronal and endothelial O 2 production during early reperfusion View details for DOI View details for Web of Science ID 000179314100003 View details for PubMedID 12460544 Quality of evidence for management of

and safety of an Oil mixture compared with conventional treatment Trufill polyvinyl alcohol PVA for preoperative embolization of cerebral October 15 1996 and March 24 1999 104 patients at 13 centers were prospectively randomized to undergo embolization using an mixture or Trufill PVA The therapy goals were determined in terms of the number of pedicles to be embolized and the percent of nidus reduction expected Embolization results were evaluated by a central laboratory Subsequent surgical resection data were recorded Safety evaluation data included recording device complications procedure complications and intracranial neurologic outcomes which could be either or reduction of AVM dimensions in the group and in the PVA group and the mean number of vessels embolized in the group and in the PVA group was similar in the two groups Coils were used more commonly with PVA embolization P No differences were detected in surgical resection time number of patients who required transfusion volume and number of transfusion units or type and volume of fluid replacement Glasgow Outcome Scale scores were not significantly different between the two groups before treatment after embolization or after resection Two of 42 patients who underwent resection and had been treated with experienced hematoma compared with eight of 45 patients who underwent resection and had been treated with PVA P prospective randomized trial showed that is equivalent to PVA as a preoperative embolic agent for treatment of cerebral AVM as determined by percent of nidus reduction and number of feeding pedicles

Arteriovenous malformations of the brain are congenital vascular lesions that affect of the population and are generally present in patients aged years The usual clinical presentations are haemorrhage seizures progressive neurological deficit or headache Results of natural history studies have shown a yearly haemorrhage rate of Frequency of rebleeding has increased over the years and several factors that increase risk of haemorrhage have been identified Although substantial the morbidity associated with haemorrhages could be less than previously thought Over the past decade great advances have been made in application of endovascular embolisation techniques stereotactic radiosurgery and microsurgery allowing effective multidisciplinary treatment of arteriovenous malformations including those previously deemed to be untreatable Increasing attention has been paid to management of aneurysms associated with these malformations Finally many reports of recurrent arteriovenous malformations have coincided with new theories regarding the embryogenesis of these disorders and laboratory work suggesting their proliferative potential View details for Web of Science ID

LASHERAS Dobak Perl Steinberg 2002 50 2 Abstract This study was undertaken to assess the acute safety and feasibility of rapidly inducing maintaining then reversing hypothermia using a novel heat transfer catheter and a automatic feedback temperature control system to overcome limitations imposed by current clinical practices used for perioperative cooling and swine mean mass kg were studied The heat transfer catheter was placed in the inferior vena cava via the femoral vein Hypothermia to 32 degrees C was induced maintained for 6 hours then reversed to 36 degrees The time needed to induce and reverse hypothermia was recorded via continuous temperature monitoring of the lower esophagus cerebrum and rectum Electrocardiography provided continuous monitoring and blood draws were made at baseline and at intervals Examination of the catheter in situ was performed after the animals were from to degrees C was rapid and uniform mean degrees with animals reaching the target temperature within 60 minutes Rewarming was also easily controlled with animals temperatures reaching 36 degrees C within 130 minutes No arrhythmia was observed and all hematological variables were within the normal range for swine There was no evidence of hemolysis or platelet changes Little to no thrombosis was data presented here suggest that rapid induction and reversal of hypothermia are technically possible using a core intravenous cooling catheter this method would provide a safe rapid and exquisitely reproducible way to induce hypothermia with subsequent restoration of normothermia

AND METABOLISM Xu Yenari Steinberg Giffard 2002 22 1 Abstract Recent experimental work has shown that hypothermia with even small decreases in temperature is broadly neuroprotective but the mechanism of this protection remains unclear Although reduction of metabolism could explain protection by deep hypothermia it does not explain the robust protection found with mild hypothermia Several reports have suggested that ischemic apoptosis is reduced by hypothermia The authors examined the effects of hypothermia on neuronal apoptosis using serum deprivation a model that induces neuronal apoptosis Mild hypothermia 33 degrees C significantly reduced the number of morphologically apoptotic neurons to less than half the number seen in normothermic culture temperatures 37 degrees C after 48 hours They examined the effect of hypothermia on several steps in the cascade and activity was significantly increased after 24 hours at 37 degrees C and was significantly lower in cultures deprived of serum at 33 degrees Cytochrome c translocation was reduced by hypothermia Western blot analysis failed to detect significant changes in Bax bcl or hsp at early time points whereas hypothermia significantly reduced cJun kinase activation The authors conclude that small decreases in temperature inhibit apoptosis very early possibly at the level of the initiation of apoptosis as suggested by reduced cJun kinase activation and before the translocation of cytochrome c with subsequent prevention of caspase activation View details for Web of Science ID 000172930900003 View details for

Iwayama Cheng Sun Fujimura Chan Steinberg 2002 22 1 Abstract Mild hypothermia protects the brain from ischemia but the underlying mechanisms of this effect are not well known The authors previously found that hypothermia reduces the density of apoptotic cells but it is not certain whether temperature alters associated biochemical events Mitochondrial release of cytochrome c has recently been shown to be a key trigger in caspase activation and apoptosis via the intrinsic pathway Using a model of transient focal cerebral ischemia the authors determined whether mild hypothermia altered expression of family proteins mitochondrial release of cytochrome c and caspase activation Mild hypothermia significantly decreased the amount of cytochrome c release 5 hours after the onset of ischemia but mitochondrial translocation of Bax was not observed until 24 hours Mild hypothermia did not alter and Bax expression and caspase activation was not observed The present study provides the first evidence that intraischemic mild hypothermia attenuates the release of cytochrome c in the brain but does not appear to affect other biochemical aspects of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway They conclude that necrotic processes may have been interrupted to prevent cytochrome c release and that the ameliorative effect of mild hypothermia may be a result of maintaining mitochondrial integrity Furthermore the authors show it is unlikely that mild hypothermia alters the intrinsic apoptotic pathway View details for Web of Science ID 000172930900004 View details for PubMedID 11807391 The role

of HSP72 after induction of experimental stroke protects neurons from ischemic damage JOURNAL OF CEREBRAL BLOOD FLOW AND METABOLISM Hoehn Ringer Xu Giffard Sapolsky Steinberg Yenari A 2001 21 11 Abstract The inducible heat shock protein HSP72 can attenuate cerebral ischemic injury when overexpressed before ischemia onset Whether HSP72 overexpression is protective when applied after ischemia onset is not known but would have important clinical implications rats underwent middle cerebral artery occlusion for 1 hour Defective herpes simplex viral HSV vectors expressing hsp72 with lacZ as a reporter were delivered 2 and 5 hours after ischemia onset into each striatum Control animals received an identical vector containing only lacZ Striatal neuron survival at 2 days was improved by 23 and 15 when HSP72 vectors were delayed and 2 hours after ischemic onset respectively P However when delayed by 5 hours HSP72 overexpression was no longer protective This is the first demonstration that HSP72 gene transfer even after ischemia onset is neuroprotective Because expression from these HSV vectors begins 4 to 6 hours after injection this suggests that the temporal therapeutic window for HSP72 is at least 6 hours after ischemia onset Future strategies aimed at enhancing HSP72 expression after clinical stroke may be worth pursuing The authors suggest that in the future HSP72 may be an effective treatment for stroke View details for Web of Science ID 000172087000006 View details for PubMedID 11702045 Hyperperfusion syndrome with hemorrhage after angioplasty for middle cerebral

Sun Xu Emond Cheng Steinberg Giffard 2001 170 1 Abstract We previously showed that overexpressing the inducible heat shock protein in primary astrocyte cultures and in a rodent stroke model using viral vectors resulted in protection from ischemia and injury However viral transfection could potentially provoke a stress response itself therefore we examined whether transgenic mice constitutively expressing human heat shock protein 70 were protected from ischemic insults Astrocyte cultures from brains of heat shock protein 70 transgenic mice were resistant to hydrogen peroxide injury in a fashion but were less resistant to hypoglycemia and deprivation Because hydrogen peroxide exposure and glucose deprivation are partially dependent on glutathione levels we determined whether heat shock protein 70 transgenic cultures had altered glutathione levels under normal growth conditions However there was no significant difference in glutathione levels between heat shock protein 70 transgenic and wildtype astrocytes Hippocampal but not cortical neuron cultures from these same transgenic mice were also protected against deprivation and glutamate toxicity In an in vivo model of permanent focal cerebral ischemia there was no significant difference in infarct size assessed 24 h postinsult These results suggest that heat shock protein 70 protects against some but not all kinds of central nervous system injury The protective effects may be related to the nature and severity of the insults as well as subpopulations of brain cells and effects of HSP70 overexpression View

increasingly clear that some of the genes induced during cerebral ischemia may actually serve to rescue the cell from death However the injured cell may not be capable of expressing protein at levels high enough to be protective One of the most exciting arenas of such interventions is the use of viral vectors to deliver potentially neuroprotective genes at high levels Neurotrophic herpes simplex viral strains are an obvious choice for gene therapy to the brain and we have utilized bipromoter vectors that are capable of transferring various genes to neurons Using this system in experimental models of stroke cardiac arrest and excitotoxicity we have found that it is possible to enhance neuron survival against such cerebral insults by genes that target various facets of injury These include energy restoration by the glucose transporter buffering calcium excess by calbindin preventing protein malfolding or aggregation by stress proteins and inhibiting apoptotic death by We show that in some cases gene therapy is also effective after the onset of injury and also address whether successful gene therapy necessarily spares function Although gene therapy is limited to the few

Kunis McLaughlin Ho Sapolsky Steinberg 2001 32 4 Abstract Increased intracellular calcium accumulation is known to potentiate ischemic injury Whether endogenous proteins can attenuate this injury has not been clearly established and existing data are conflicting Calbindin D28K CaBP is one such intracellular calcium buffer We investigated whether CaBP overexpression is neuroprotective against transient focal cerebral herpes simplex virus vectors that encoded the genes for cabp and as a reporter gene lacZ were used rats received bilateral striatal injections of viral vector 12 to 15 hours before ischemia onset With the use of an intraluminal occluding suture animals were subjected to 1 hour of middle cerebral artery occlusion followed by 47 hours of reperfusion Brains were harvested and stained with to visualize the gene product of lacZ The number of remaining virally transfected neurons in both the ischemic and contralateral striata were counted and expressed as the percentage of surviving neurons in the ischemic striatum relative to the contralateral nonischemic neuron survivorship among animals was versus among those receiving lacZ P conclude that viral overexpression of CaBP leads to neuroprotection in this model of central nervous system injury This is the first demonstration that CaBP overexpression protects neurons in a focal stroke model View details for Web of

focal cerebral ischemia and to ascertain whether the neuroprotective effects of mild hypothermia induced during the ischemic period are sustained over the first study rats underwent 2 hours of middle cerebral artery MCA occlusion Animals in one group were maintained under normothermic conditions N group 23 rats throughout the period of ischemia and reperfusion Rats in four additional groups were exposed to 2 hours of hypothermia which commenced at ischemia onset H0 group 11 rats or with delays of 90 H90 group 10 rats 120 H120 group 10 rats or 180 H180 group five rats minutes and allowed to survive for 3 days In the second study animals underwent hours of MCA occlusion and were maintained under normothermic 48 rats or hypothermic 44 rats conditions during the ischemia period after which they survived for 3 days 1 week or 2 months All animals were evaluated for neurological findings at 24 hours and 48 hours postischemia and before they were killed Regions of infarct were determined by examining hematoxylin and eosinstained brain slices obtained at six coronal hypothermia conferred significant degrees of neuroprotection in terms of survival behavioral deficits and histopathological changes even when its induction was delayed by 120 minutes after onset of MCA occlusion p compared with normothermic conditions Furthermore the neuroprotective effect of mild hypothermia duration that

model of experimental stroke we characterize the effects of mild hypothermia an effective neuroprotectant on fluid shifts cerebral perfusion and spreading depression SD using DWI and MRI PWI rats underwent 2 h of middle cerebral artery MCA occlusion and were either kept normothermic or rendered mildly hypothermic shortly after MCA occlusion for 2 DWI images were obtained 2 and 24 h after MCA occlusion and maps of the apparent diffusion coefficient ADC were generated transient ADC decreases were also detected using DWI in animals subjected to topical KCl application and ischemia Mild hypothermia significantly inhibited DWI lesion growth early after the onset of ischemia as well as 24 h later and improved recovery of striatal ADC by 24 Mild hypothermia prolonged ADC transients and further decreased the ADC following KCl application and immediately after MCA occlusion Cerebral perfusion however was not affected by temperature changes We conclude that mild hypothermia is neuroprotective and suppresses infarct growth early after the onset of ischemia with better ADC recovery The ADC decrease during SD was greater during mild hypothermia and suggests that the source of the ADC is more complex than previously believed View details for Web of Science ID 000166026800008 View details for PubMedID 11102575 Moyamoya disease CANADIAN JOURNAL OF NEUROLOGICAL SCIENCES

Dietz Andrews Jaffe Steinberg Wallace 2000 27 1 Abstract Rewarming victims of hypothermia such as divers or immersion victims participants in winter sports and military operations and surgical patients on cardiopulmonary bypass CPB may lead to vascular instability multiorgan failure shock and even death While the causes of these rewarming symptoms are unknown they may be related to bacterial lipopolysaccharide LPS translocated from the intestines into the circulation due to splanchnic ischemia We have determined LPS during the cooling to degrees C and rewarming phases of hypothermic surgery in 11 patients at the Stanford University Medical Center During rewarming there was an LPS spike in in one more patient there was an LPS spike during surgery but not during rewarming and in there was no rise in LPS a temporary endotoxemia occurred in patients usually at the commencement of rewarming All four patients with no LPS spike received dexamethasone for at least 7 days before surgery We propose that hypothermia reduced splanchnic blood flow BF causing ischemic damage to the gut wall and translocation of LPS from the gut into the vascular space Upon rewarming splanchnic BF is restored the translocated LPS transits from the splanchnic to the systemic circulations as a bolus and the gut wall is healed No sequelae occurred in these patients because of their adequately functioning immune systems However had they been immunocompromised symptoms might have occurred Rewarming of accident victims probably also incurs a similar risk of endotoxemia and dexamethasone may have protected the gut wall Further studies are indicated View details for Web of Science ID 000086978900001 View details for PubMedID 10813433 Microsurgical resection of brainstem

four complex aneurysms in four of the four patients presented with subarachnoid hemorrhage The fourth patient presented with a progressive neurological deficit secondary to an associated arteriovenous malformation Three of the aneurysms were located in the posterior circulation two basilar apex aneurysms and one bilobed vertebrobasilar junction aneurysm with a ventral component The fourth aneurysm was a of the patients with a basilar apex aneurysm and the patient with the paraclinoid aneurysm underwent surgery intended to create a narrow neck that would be amenable to future coiling The patient with the bilobed vertebrobasilar junction aneurysm underwent surgery to treat the ventral lobe whereas the dorsal lobe with the neck partially buried in the brainstem was treated endovascularly The second patient with a basilar apex aneurysm was in poor clinical condition after subarachnoid hemorrhage and was therefore treated with coil embolization to reduce the risk of rebleeding After the patient made a good clinical recovery the residual aneurysm was surgically clipped Angiographic documented the complete obliteration of all four aneurysms Clinically all patients had good to excellent outcomes after a period of 6 to 30 aneurysms that may be difficult to treat with a single mode of therapy can be safely and successfully treated with a combination of endovascular and microsurgical techniques For patients with aneurysms that are difficult to access surgically without incurring significant morbidity microsurgical clipping may be used as the initial procedure to create a smaller neck Alternatively for patients who are in poor clinical condition after subarachnoid hemorrhage and who harbor a aneurysm in a surgically formidable location partial coiling may be used initially to

emerged concerning the cellular and molecular events underlying necrotic neuron death after seizure or hypoglycemia This has allowed the design of rational therapies to protect neurons at such times One of the most exciting arenas of such interventions is the use of viral vectors to deliver neuroprotective genes This review considers the progress in this nascent discipline Neuroprotection has been demonstrated against a variety of in vitro and in vivo rodent models of necrotic insults with vectors overexpressing genes that target various facets of injury These have included the energetic components calcium excess accumulation of reactive oxygen species protein malfolding inflammation and triggering of apoptosis programmed cell death in a subset of cells A number of caveats subtleties and pressing questions concerning this literature then are considered These include whether these gene therapy interventions actually prevent rather than merely delay neuron death the extent to which the effects of such vectors on neuronal cell biology is actually understood the potential adverse effects of the use of such vectors and whether sparing a neuron from death with one of these

response to many metabolic disturbances and injuries including stroke neurodegenerative disease epilepsy and trauma the cell mounts a stress response with induction of a variety of proteins most notably the heat shock protein HSP70 Whether stress proteins are neuroprotective has been hotly debated as these proteins might be merely an epiphenomenon unrelated to cell survival Only recently with the availability of transgenic animals and gene transfer has it become possible to overexpress the gene encoding HSP70 to test directly the hypothesis that stress proteins protect cells from injury A few groups have now shown that overproduction of HSP70 leads to protection in several different models of nervous system injury This review will cover these studies along with the potential mechanisms by which HSP70 might mediate cellular protection View details for Web of Science ID 000083729600007 View details for PubMedID 10562718 outcomes after carotid stent placement for treatment of carotid artery dissection NEUROSURGERY Liu Paulsen Marcellus Steinberg Marks 1999 45 6 Abstract To assess the outcomes after stent placement for the treatment of carotid artery 1992 and 1998 seven patients underwent stenting procedures for treatment of extracranial carotid artery dissections resulting from various causes including trauma n 2 iatrogenesis n 2 spontaneous development n 2 and fibromuscular dysplasia n 1 Stenting procedures were performed for large nonhealing pseudoaneurysms four cases or severe preocclusive stenosis three cases A total of 11 stents were placed Palmaz stents n 8 Wallstents n 3 Radiological examinations were performed after a mean period of months range mo using conventional or computed tomographic angiography Clinical data were obtained after a mean period of months range mo stent placements resulted in complete resolution of stenosis For two of the four patients with aneurysms the lesions occluded spontaneously at the time of the procedure The third patient required coil embolization of the pseudoaneurysm One patient exhibited progressive shrinkage of the aneurysm in serial examinations with healing after 18 months No clinical complications were associated with the procedures One patient exhibited progression to asymptomatic occlusion 3 months after stenting The remaining six patients exhibited no significant changes in luminal diameters All patients remained in clinically stable condition with no ischemic symptoms during more than years mean period of experience suggests that stents placed for treatment of extracranial carotid artery dissections remain patent and patients remain free of symptoms on a basis Additional studies will be required to determine the optimal types of stents and intervals for monitoring using imaging View

official journal of National Stroke Association Chang Lopez Steinberg 1999 8 6 Abstract Goal The purpose of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of electrophysiological monitoring during the resection of vascular malformations Methods Between September 1994 and April 1996 we surgically resected vascular malformations 31 arteriovenous malformations 22 angiographically occult vascular malformations from 53 patients 56 procedures and used intraoperative evoked potential monitoring Somatosensory evoked potentials SSEPs were monitored in 54 procedures 96 and brain stem auditory evoked potentials BAEPs in 17 30 The neurological status of the patients was evaluated before and after surgery Findings Five of the 54 patients 9 monitored with SSEPs had SSEP changes 4 transient 1 persistent coinciding with new clinical neurological deficits in 4 patients all transient In all 4 patients who had transient SSEP changes the changes resolved with adjustment or removal of clips on feeding vessels 2 patients or with elevating mean arterial pressure MAP 2 patients patients 91 had neither SSEP or neurological examination alterations One of 17 patients 6 monitored with BAEPs had neurological and persistent BAEP changes 15 88 had neither BAEP or neurological changes and 1 6 had a neurological change despite no change in BAEP false negative The sensitivity of SSEP and BAEP for predicting a new postoperative deficit transient or prolonged in this series was 86 specificity was 98 Clinical outcome was excellent in 41 patients good in 11 and poor in 1 no patients died and was largely related to pretreatment grade Conclusion SSEPs and BAEPs predict the likelihood of clinical neurological injury during resection of vascular malformations with high sensitivity and specificity and may prove a useful adjunct in treating these lesions View details for PubMedID 17895195 Intraoperative electrical stimulation for identification of cranial nerve nuclei 45th Annual Meeting of the Chang Lopez Steinberg JOHN WILEY SONS 1999 Abstract The purpose of this study was to evaluate the feasibility and usefulness of cranial nerve nuclei monitoring during resection of brainstem cavernous malformations Eleven patients with brainstem cavernous malformations underwent resection of their malformations utilizing cranial nerve nuclei monitoring Cranial nerves V and VII were monitored by placing electrodes in muscle groups innervated by these nerves and recording neurotonic discharges and triggered electromyographic EMG activity after electrical stimulation of the corresponding brainstem nuclei Seven of 11 procedures 64 with cranial nerve nuclei monitoring were noted to have cranial nerve nuclei activity corresponding to manipulation of the nuclei The cavernous malformation was completely resected in 5 of 7 cases with cranial nerve nuclei activity and in all 4 cases without activity In the remaining 2 cases the cavernous malformation was not resected due to the proximity of the monitored cranial nerve nuclei to the cavernous malformation and to increasing neurotonic activity as the cavernous malformation was approached None of the 11 patients had new permanent postoperative deficits corresponding to the cranial nerve nuclei monitored 1 patient had a transient partial facial palsy lasting 2 days Preliminary results indicate that cranial nerve nuclei monitoring proves useful in preserving neurologic function and reducing surgical morbidity during resection of brainstem cavernous malformations particularly indicating when lesion resection places these nuclei at risk View details for Web of Science ID 000083306000008 View details for PubMedID 10514231 Direct and combined revascularization in pediatric moyamoya disease NEUROSURGERY Golby Marks

treatment Controversy exists regarding whether direct or indirect revascularization yields better outcomes This study involves a experience with direct anastomosis and is the first North American series using direct revascularization for pediatric patients with moyamoya patients age range yr mean age yr underwent direct revascularization of 21 hemispheres Two patients had experienced failure of previous indirect revascularization procedures with continued clinical deterioration Superficial temporal cerebral artery anastomosis was performed in 19 hemispheres with concurrent encephaloduroarteriosynangiosis in 6 Middle meningeal cerebral artery anastomosis and omental transposition were each performed in one hemisphere periods ranged from 12 to 65 months mean 35 mo and monitoring included neurological examinations angiography magnetic resonance imaging and cerebral blood flow neurological conditions of all patients were stable or improved after surgery None of the patients developed new strokes and no new ischemic lesions were seen in magnetic resonance imaging scans All grafts evaluated by angiography were patent Postoperative cerebral blood flow studies showed significantly improved blood flow versus P n 4 and hemodynamic reserve versus P n 4 compared with preoperative revascularization by direct anastomosis in pediatric patients is technically feasible is well tolerated and can improve the progressive natural history the angiographic appearance and the cerebral blood flow abnormalities associated with the disease Direct revascularization has the advantage of providing immediate and revascularization and is particularly useful for patients who have experienced failure of previous indirect revascularization procedures View details for

of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty in the treatment of symptomatic intracranial atherosclerotic patients with fixed symptomatic intracranial stenoses were treated over a period with percutaneous transluminal angioplasty Patients who underwent successful angioplasty were followed up for 16 to 74 months mean months angioplasty that resulted in decreased stenosis was performed in 21 of 23 patients In 1 case a stenosis could not be safely crossed and in another balloon dilatation resulted in vessel rupture This vessel rupture resulted in the 1 periprocedural death in the series In there was 1 stroke in the same vascular territory as the angioplasty and 2 strokes in the series overall This yielded an annual stroke rate of for strokes in the territory appropriate to the site of angioplasty can be performed with a high degree of technical success The clinical available in this series suggests that it may reduce the risk of future stroke in patients with symptomatic

preradiosurgical embolization of these deep central lesions and describe the contribution of embolization to multimodality patients with basal ganglia thalamic AVMs underwent embolization in a total of 69 sessions Seven of the 38 patients presented with hemorrhage and 23 of 38 exhibited neurological deficits before therapy Thirty patients underwent embolization with a liquid adhesive cyanoacrylate and five of these patients also underwent embolization with polyvinyl alcohol Five patients were treated with polyvinyl alcohol or polyvinyl alcohol and silk One patient underwent embolization alone 19 underwent embolization followed by radiosurgery 5 underwent embolization plus microsurgical resection and 13 patients were treated using all three patients did not undergo embolization because of the morphological features of the AVMs and poor endovascular access The patients who underwent embolization achieved AVM volume reductions of 10 to 100 mean Fifteen patients achieved complete obliteration of their AVMs one with embolization alone three with embolization followed by radiosurgery five with embolization plus microsurgical resection and six with a combination of all three modalities At the time of the last imaging session embolization combined with radiosurgery 19 patients yielded a mean volume reduction of and all three modalities 13 patients yielded a mean reduction of Four permanent neurological deficits resulted from embolization of procedures of patients The complication rate was higher in the earlier years of this embolization plays an important role in multimodality treatment of AVMs involving the basal ganglia thalamus Embolization can result in obliteration of a significant volume of the AVM and may allow complete obliteration of

Case report NEUROSURGERY Chang Marks Steinberg 1999 44 5 Abstract Recanalization and subsequent rupture of giant aneurysms of the posterior circulation after Hunterian ligation is an extremely rare event that has been noted to occur with basilar apex basilar trunk and vertebrobasilar junction aneurysms We report the case of a giant previously unruptured right vertebral artery aneurysm which recanalized from the contralateral vertebral artery and subsequently ruptured after previously performed angiography showed complete thrombosis of the woman presented with headaches ataxia and lower extremity weakness A giant right vertebral artery aneurysm was found during the patient of the size of the aneurysm and the absence of a discrete neck Hunterian ligation was performed After treatment angiograms showed no filling of the aneurysm from either the right or left vertebral artery Nine days later after the patient developed lethargy and nausea repeat angiography showed that a small portion of the aneurysmal base had recanalized The next day the patient had a massive subarachnoid hemorrhage and subsequently think that this is a previously undescribed complication associated with

3 Abstract To evaluate the safety and efficacy of preradiosurgical and presurgical embolization of arteriovenous malformations AVMs involving the rolandic consecutive patients with rolandic AVMs seen during a period December 1997 were evaluated All patients underwent superselective sodium amobarbital testing to determine any changes in the results of the neurological examinations before undergoing embolization In 16 of 17 patients somatosensory evoked potentials augmented physical examinations Patients were embolized with cyanoacrylate Histoacryl Braun Melsungen Germany and iophendylate

a total of 40 feeding arteries were embolized Two patients were unable to undergo embolization because of positive results of the amobarbital testing despite repeated attempts to reposition a microcatheter in the AVM circulation In one case somatosensory evoked potentials and the results of the physical examination were both positive in the other case only the somatosensory evoked potentials were used in a pediatric patient under general anesthesia All patients with AVMs that were embolized experienced a significant size reduction of their lesions range mean 63 There were no permanent complications Four procedures 10 of the procedures 23 of the patients resulted in minor transient neurological deficits with patients conditions returning to baseline Thirteen patients subsequently underwent radiosurgery three underwent surgical resection and one underwent combined surgery and radiosurgery Complete obliteration of the lesions has been achieved in four patients to

April 1996 we surgically treated 70 aneurysms in 49 consecutive patients 58 operations with the aid of intraoperative evoked potential monitoring This study sought to evaluate the usefulness of SSEP and BAEP monitoring during intracranial aneurysm patient age was range years The sizes of the aneurysms were mm 15 mm 26 mm 11 mm seven mm six and 25 mm five SSEPs were monitored in 58 procedures 100 and BAEPs in 15 26 The neurological status of the patients was evaluated before and after of the 58 procedures 22 monitored with SSEPs had SSEP changes 12 transient one persistent 45 78 had no SSEP changes Three of 15 patients 20 monitored with BAEPs had changes two transient one persistent 12 80 had no BAEP changes Of the 14 patients with transient SSEP or BAEP changes these changes resolved with adjustment or removal of aneurysm clips nine elevating MAP four or retractor adjustment one Mean time from precipitating event to electrophysiological change was minutes range and the mean time for recovery of potentials in patients with transient changes was minutes range Clinical outcome was excellent in 39 patients good in five and poor in three two patients died and was largely related

angiographically occult vascular malformations Neurosurgery Vanefsky Cheng Chang Norbash Snipe Marks Steinberg 1999 44 6 discussion Abstract OBJECTIVE Histological and radiological classification of vascular malformations has previously been attempted in an effort to understand their nature and predict their biological behavior There exists a subgroup of vascular malformations that are angiographically occult and share a common magnetic resonance imaging MRI appearance but may differ in their behavior We sought to determine any correlation between MRI features and final histopathological diagnosis METHODS We reviewed our series of 72 patients with angiographically occult vascular malformations operated on at Stanford University Medical Center between 1988 and 1993 Radiographic magnetic resonance images and histopathological specimens were retrospectively evaluated for various diagnostic features RESULTS Our data indicate that lesions exhibiting a ring of hemosiderin are associated with the presence of a cavernous malformation CM component 86 of CMs versus 33 of lesions A lesion associated with edema mass effect or a single prominent blood product on MRI correlates with the presence of an arteriovenous malformation AVM component percent of AVMs and 80 of lesions with partial AVM components showed edema compared with 8 of CMs and 0 of venous malformations Sixty percent of AVMs and 63 of lesions with partial AVM components showed a single prominent blood product compared with 8 of CMs and 0 of venous malformations Finally 60 of AVMs exhibited mass effect compared with 20 of CMs Additionally an expansile hemorrhage is suggestive of an AVM CONCLUSION This study is the first to demonstrate that a particular MRI appearance of an angiographically occult vascular malformation is suggestive of an AVM component This may have important implications with regard to the behavior of the lesion and planning of future treatment View

express high levels of the heat shock protein HSP72 Whether HSP72 represents merely a marker of stress or plays a role in improving neuron survival in these cases has been debated Some induced tolerance experiments have provided correlative evidence for a neuroprotective effect and others have documented neuroprotection in the absence of HSP72 synthesis We report that gene transfer therapy

neuron survival from to in rats subjected to 1 hour of middle cerebral artery occlusion and improved survival of hippocampal dentate gyrus neurons after systemic kainic acid administration from to We

arteriovenous malformation AVM aneurysms are a subset of the cerebrovascular disease population The origin of these dual lesions is likely multifactorial with hemodynamic stresses having a dominant influence In most patients who present with hemorrhage the aneurysm is the usual source Since aneurysm rupture continues to carry a more significant morbidity and mortality when compared to AVM hemorrhage the authors recommend that the aneurysm be treated first or simultaneously with the AVM in the majority of cases Treatment of the AVM first is primarily reserved for patients who have

Abstract We incorporated magnetic resonance imaging MRI DWI and MRI PWI to evaluate the efficacy of thrombolysis in experimental embolic stroke using a plasminogen activator reteplase Reteplase rPA is an unglycosylated plasminogen activator with enhanced fibrinolytic potency Right internal carotid arteries of 34 rabbits were embolized using aged heterologous thrombi Baseline DWI and PWI scans hours

stroke induction MRIs were performed at 3 and 5 hours after embolization Six hours after embolization brains were harvested and examined for hemorrhage Posttreatment areas of diffusion abnormality and

incidence of wound site hemorrhage was higher with either rPA or One fatal systemic hemorrhage was observed in each of the groups Cerebral perfusion was equally improved with either or rPA without causing excess cerebral hemorrhage An advantage of rPA is dosing rather than continuous infusion Use of rPA for stroke treatment should be further explored View details for PubMedID 17895078 Pathological changes in surgically resected angiographically occult vascular malformations after radiation NEUROSURGERY Gewirtz Steinberg Crowley Levy 1998 42 4 Abstract The goal of this study was to evaluate the pathological changes associated with radiation treatment stereotactic radiosurgery or conventional irradiation of angiographically occult vascular malformations AOVMs patients underwent surgical resection of an AOVM in the mesial temporal lobe brain stem thalamus or basal ganglia after previous radiation treatment The indications for surgery were recurrent symptomatic bleeding from the lesion in 10 patients and recurrent intractable seizures in 1 patient Radiation was used as the initial therapy because the risk of surgical resection was deemed too high Three patients received conventional radiation therapy of 3000 to 5400 rads at an outside institution One patient received radiosurgery with the gamma knife at another institution using a dose of 15 Gy to the margin The remaining 7 patients received stereotactic radiosurgery with a particle beam The dose range was from 18 to 26 Gy equivalents The interval from radiation to surgical resection ranged from 1 to 10 years with a mean of years These lesions were compared with 10 nonirradiated cavernous irradiated lesion was identified pathologically as a true arteriovenous malformation despite being angiographically occult This lesion did not demonstrate significant changes in the vasculature but did have radiation necrosis of the surrounding brain 5 years after 25 Gy equivalents of radiosurgery Two other specimens were too small to identify the type of vascular malformation adequately Of the remaining eight malformations identified as cavernous malformations six showed a combination of marked fibrosis of the vascular channels fibrinoid necrosis and ferrugination However the fibrinoid necrosis was the only finding unique to the irradiated lesions compared with nonirradiated controls All the irradiated lesions still had patent vascular channels none were completely or conventional radiation therapy did not cause histologic vascular obliteration in intracranial AOVMs evaluated 1 to 10 years mean yr after radiation delivery It should be recognized that these patients are irradiation failures who may not be representative of all irradiated patients However recurrent bleeding from

Herpes simplex viral vectors expressing are neuroprotective when delivered after a stroke JOURNAL OF CEREBRAL BLOOD FLOW AND METABOLISM Lawrence McLaughlin Sun Ho McIntosh Kunis Sapolsky Steinberg 1997 17 7 Abstract Considerable interest has focused on the possibility of using viral vectors to deliver genes to the central nervous system for the purpose of decreasing necrotic neuronal injury To that end we have previously shown that a herpes simplex virus HSV vector expressing could protect neurons from ischemia In that study vector was delivered before the ischemia However for such gene therapy to be of clinical use vectors must be protective even if delivered after the onset of the insult In the present study we show that an HSV vector expressing protects striatal neurons when delivered after focal ischemia Rats were exposed to middle cerebral artery occlusion for 1 hour followed by reperfusion and damage was assessed 48 hours later Delivery of the vector 30 minutes after reperfusion hours after ischemia onset prevented any significant loss of neurons in the striatum In contrast in rats microinfused with a vector only expressing a reporter gene a highly significant loss of neurons occurred By 4 hours into the reperfusion period 5 hours after ischemia onset delivery of the vector was no longer protective These data show the efficacy of postinsult gene therapy

with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator and hirulog a novel antithrombin DWI can identify areas of ischemia minutes from stroke onset while PWI identifies regions of impaired blood flow Right internal carotid arteries of 36 rabbits were embolized using aged heterologous thrombi Baseline DWI and PWI scans were obtained to confirm successful embolization Four animals with no observable DWI lesion on the initial scan were excluded therefore a total of 32 animals were randomized to one of three treatment groups n 11 plus hirulog n 11 or placebo n 10 Treatment was begun 1 h after stroke induction Intravenous doses were as follows 5 over h with 20 of the total dose given as a bolus hirulog 1 bolus followed by 5 over 1 MRI was performed at 2 3 and 5 h following embolization Six hours after embolization brains were harvested examined for hemorrhage then prepared for histologic analysis The decreased fibrinogen levels by 73 and hirulog prolonged the aPTT to four times the control value Posttreatment areas of diffusion abnormality and perfusion delay were expressed as a ratio of baseline values Significantly improved perfusion was seen in the plus hirulog group compared with placebo normalized ratios of the perfusion delay areas were as follows placebo and hirulog p Comparison of diffusion abnormality ratios measured at 5 h showed trends favoring reduced lesion size in both groups given normalized ratios of diffusion abnormality areas were as follows placebo and hirulog p Significant cerebral hemorrhage was observed in one placebo two and three plus hirulog treated animals One fatal systemic hemorrhage was observed in each of the groups We conclude that plus hirulog improves cerebral perfusion but does not necessarily reduce cerebral injury DWI and PWI are

Selfotel A Novel Neuroprotective Agent Against CNS Injury CNS drug reviews Steinberg 1996 2 3 Abstract The hypothesis that excitoxicity is a mechanism of damage following different types of cerebral injury including global and focal ischemia 34 and head and spinal cord trauma has been supported by numerous findings During ischemia for example glutamate neurotoxicity is mediated in part through NMDA receptors since selective antagonists to this receptor protect against injury In the last few years different NMDA antagonists have been developed and tested they can be divided into competitive and noncompetitive antagonists Noncompetitive NMDA antagonists are extremely lipophilic and reach high levels in the brain after systemic administration Various studies have demonstrated that these agents provide neuroprotection against injury for review see ref 29 Many competitive NMDA antagonists are hydrophilic and require direct cerebral administration to obtain high brain levels Newer

undergone radiosurgery Pathological investigation showed endothelial proliferation with hyaline and calcium in vessel walls There was partial or complete thrombosis of some AVM vessels and evidence of vessel and brain necrosis in many cases Complete resection was achieved in 28 patients and partial resection in five Clinical outcome was excellent or good in 31 cases and two patients died of

atherosclerotic stenosis in vertebral arteries Three patients with severe atherosclerotic vascular disease underwent vertebral artery stent placement using a balloon expandable stent Medical therapy aspirin and warfarin and conventional percutaneous angioplasty failed to resolve the disease and the patients developed symptomatic restenosis within 3 months of angioplasty Two patients had symptoms of anterior circulation ischemia with carotid artery occlusions and reduced supply to the anterior circulation from the stenosed vertebral arteries One patient had recurrent posterior circulation symptoms Stents were successfully placed in all three resulting in immediate reversal of stenosis and resolution of symptoms Clinical study mean 9 months has shown no recurrent symptoms in the patient with posterior circulation symptoms but the two patients with anterior circulation ischemia did develop recurrent symptoms Angiographic follow up in these two patients at 3 months and 1 year however demonstrated continued patency of vertebral artery lumina They underwent bypass surgery to relieve their symptoms This experience suggests stents can be placed without complication in the proximal

E acid CGP 40116 on neuronal damage in vivo and in vitro We studied 20 rabbits that underwent a occlusion of the left internal carotid anterior cerebral and middle cerebral arteries followed by 4 h of reperfusion Ten minutes after occlusion the animals were treated with either normal saline n 7 or CGP 40116 at two different doses 20 n 6 40 n 7 administered over a period Somatosensory evoked potentials were used to confirm adequate ischemia and neuronal injury was assessed by histopathology and magnetic resonance imaging CGP 40116 decreased cortical ischemic neuronal damage by 74 and 77 control CGP 20 CGP 40 p and reduced cortical ischemic edema by 52 and 35 control CGP 20 CGP 40 p but did not protect against striatal injury We performed a second study using primary cell cultures from mouse neocortex to determine the effects of CGP 40116 on neuronal death induced by a exposure to 500 microM NMDA or by 45 min of deprivation OGD Our results demonstrate that CGP 40116 was

WEST WINN FERGUSON 1995 37 1 Abstract A multicenter randomized blinded trial was conducted to study the possible role of intracisternally administered fibrinolytic agent recombinant tissue plasminogen activator in preventing delayed onset cerebral vasospasm following aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage SAH The target population was patients with ruptured saccular aneurysms causing severe SAH placing them at high risk for vasospasm Treatment consisted of a single 10 ml intraoperative injection of either vehicle buffer solution or 1 into the opened basal subarachnoid cisterns immediately following aneurysm clipping The major efficacy endpoint in this trial was angiographic vasospasm and the major safety concern was intracranial hemorrhage One hundred patients were randomized 49 to placebo and 51 to treatment Baseline population characteristics were similar between the two groups Severity of intracranial hemorrhage on computed tomographic scans was also similar between groups of both placebo and treated patients had thick subarachnoid clots and the rates for intracerebral and intraventricular hemorrhage were respectively and for placebo and and for Nine randomized patients did not receive treatment in the operating room and in 8 this was due to conditions felt unsafe for the administration of a fibrinolytic agent The overall incidence of angiographic vasospasm measured between the seventh and eleventh day following SAH was similar between the two groups with arterial narrowing detected in of dosed placebo patients and of treated patients However there was a trend toward lesser degrees of vasospasm in the treated group The rates for no or mild moderate and severe vasospasm were 69 16 and 15 in the treated group versus 42 35 and 23 in the placebo group P When only those patients with thick subarachnoid clots were considered at the treating centers there was a 56 relative risk reduction of severe vasospasm in the treated group which was significant P ABSTRACT

AGAINST FOCAL NEUROBIOLOGY OF DISEASE Steinberg Panahian PEREZPINZON Sun Modi SEPINWALL J 1995 2 2 Abstract NMDA receptor antagonists have been shown to protect against focal cerebral ischaemia when administered either before or soon after the onset of ischaemia However the precise therapeutic window for protection using these drugs remains to be defined We studied dextrorphan administration delayed for 2 or 4 h after transient middle cerebral focal ischaemia in a rabbit model With a 2h delay the mid mg and high doses mg provided significant cortical neuroprotection 50 and 58 reduction respectively and the low dose mg protected against ischaemic damage in the basal ganglia 52 reduction Animals having serum dextrorphan concentrations greater than 2000 ng showed 50 cortical neuroprotection for the group No significant neuroprotection was seen in the group and the 4 h delay animals with dextrorphan levels greater than 2000 ng had more severe ischaemic oedema than the saline controls These results suggest a narrow temporal therapeutic window for neuroprotection where delivery of drug delayed by 2 h was efficacious but treatment at 4 h after ischaemia onset was not beneficial and possibly harmful These findings may have important implications for the treatment of clinical stroke View details for Web of Science ID A1995TA63500005 View details for PubMedID 8980014 THROMBOLYSIS WITH ACTIVATOR TPA IS THROMBOSIS RESEARCH Yenari Palmer Bracci Steinberg 1995 77 5 Abstract Thrombolysis with tissue plasminogen activator tPA and hypothermia are two potential treatment modalities for acute ischemic stroke Many investigators are studying these modalities both in the laboratory and in clinical trials Because these modalities each appear to show benefit in animal models there is considerable interest in studying combined therapy with both thrombolysis and hypothermia However it is known that alterations in the coagulation system can occur with decreased body temperature Clinicians have frequently observed bleeding problems when patients are subjected to hypothermia for a variety of reasons Hypothermia induced coagulopathy has been attributed to a variety of factors Hypothermia can cause platelet dysfunction inhibition of clotting factors increased fibrinolysis and endogenous production of a factor Groups who studied fibrinolysis and temperature however found the opposite to be the case Clot lysis studies with streptokinase showed increased fibrinolysis at higher temperatures Data by Mumme suggested that the peak fibrinolytic activity of streptokinase was at 40 degrees C but at 43 degrees C fibrinolytic activity was decreased Rijken et al studied plasminogen activation with tissue plasminogen activator tPA urokinase and streptokinase at extremely low temperatures They found less plasminogen activation and fibrinogen degradation at 25 degrees C compared to 37 degrees C but negligible differences at 10 degrees C 0 degrees C and degrees To our knowledge there is no data studying the fibrinolytic activity of tissue plasminogen activator tPA at temperature ranges between degrees C which is the range of temperatures used

NEUROPROTECTION BY ANTAGONISTS IN FOCAL IS DEPENDENT ON CONTINUED MAINTENANCE DOSING NEUROSCIENCE Steinberg Yoon Kunis Sun Maier Grant A 1995 64 1 Abstract While antagonists have been shown to attenuate neuronal damage in focal cerebral ischemia few studies have examined whether continuous or multiple dose treatment is necessary for maximum efficacy We studied the effect of a loading dose only or load plus maintenance infusion using several antagonists dextromethorphan dextrorphan and the levorotatory enantiomer of dextromethorphan levomethorphan in a rabbit model of focal cerebral ischemia anesthetized rabbits underwent occlusion of the left internal carotid anterior cerebral and middle cerebral arteries for 2 h followed by 4 h of reperfusion Drugs were administered 10 min after occlusion Dextromethorphan and dextrorphan protected against ischemic edema only when given as load plus maintenance 29 and 31 reduction respectively while both load only and load plus maintenance of protected against edema 26 and 31 reduction respectively Levomethorphan load plus maintenance also protected against ischemic edema 25 reduction However dextromethorphan and dextrorphan both required maintenance infusion to protect against ischemic neuronal damage 24 and 27 reduction in area of ischemic neuronal damage respectively while levomethorphan failed to protect against neuronal injury even when given as load plus maintenance Administration of as load plus maintenance reduced ischemic neuronal damage by 23 but this difference was not quite statistically significant These results suggest that processes of ischemic damage such as excitotoxic injury continue for several hours beyond the initial period of focal ischemia and that antagonists require more prolonged administration to achieve neuroprotection ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS View details for Web of Science ID A1995QC34300010 View details for PubMedID 7708219 CAUSED BY INTERRUPTED REPEATED VERSUS UNINTERRUPTED OCCLUSION IN A FOCAL ISCHEMIC MODEL JOURNAL OF NEUROSURGERY Steinberg Panahian Sun Maier Kunis 1994 81 4 Abstract Temporary intracranial arterial occlusion is often utilized during the surgical treatment of intracranial aneurysms Although numerous experimental studies have suggested that repetitive brief periods of global ischemia cause more severe cerebral injury than a similar single period of global ischemia this issue has not been extensively studied in relation to focal ischemia It remains controversial whether it is safer to use brief periods of interrupted temporary occlusion separated by reperfusion periods or a more prolonged single temporary occlusion This question is addressed in studies on a rabbit model of transient focal cerebral ischemia Sixteen anesthetized rabbits underwent transorbital occlusion of the left internal carotid middle cerebral and anterior cerebral arteries with one of two paradigms uninterrupted occlusion 1 hour of temporary occlusion followed by 5 hours of reperfusion in eight rabbits or interrupted occlusion three separate periods of occlusion with 10 minutes of reperfusion between occlusions followed by 4 hours 40 minutes of reperfusion in eight rabbits Histopathological evaluation for ischemic neuronal damage and magnetic resonance imaging studies for ischemic edema were conducted 6 hours after the initial arterial occlusion The animals in the interrupted repeated occlusion group showed a 59 decrease in the area of cortical ischemic neuronal damage mean standard error of the mean compared with the uninterrupted occlusion group 5 p There was no difference between the groups in the extent of striatal ischemic damage or area of ischemic edema These results suggest that interrupted repeated focal ischemia causes less cortical ischemic injury than uninterrupted transient ischemia of a similar total duration Although caution should be exercised in extrapolating from these results to the clinical situation they may have important implications for temporary arterial occlusion during intracranial surgery View details for Web of Science ID A1994PJ91900008 View details for PubMedID 7931589 THE

22 Abstract After the occlusion of an internal carotid artery the principal source of collateral flow is through the arteries of the circle of Willis but the size and patency of these arteries are quite variable Study of the anatomy of the collateral pathways in patients with occlusion with or without infarction in the watershed area of the deep white matter may identify patterns that afford

of the internal carotid artery Four collateral pathways to the occluded vessel were evaluated the proximal segment of the anterior cerebral artery the posterior communicating artery the ophthalmic artery and leptomeningeal collateral vessels from the posterior cerebral features of the ipsilateral posterior communicating artery were related to the risk of watershed infarction The presence of posterior communicating arteries measuring at least 1 mm in diameter was associated with the absence of watershed infarction 13 hemispheres no infarcts P Conversely there were 4 watershed infarcts in the 6 hemispheres with posterior communicating arteries measuring less than 1 mm in diameter and 10 infarcts in the 13 hemispheres with no detectable flow in the ipsilateral posterior communicating

conventional microcatheters In vivo experiments in rabbits included aneurysm models and bifurcation and arterial occlusions carotid and renal three designs deployed coils easily and were able to retract coils after partial deployment Motion was seen in previously released coils and in the catheter when using the clamped ball and looped ribbon designs The interlocking cylinder design did not cause similar motion When compared with the other two designs the interlocking cylinder had significantly greater separation forces between coil pusher and coil while in the catheter Frictional forces within the catheter were lower for the interlocking cylinder mechanically detachable coil design than for a commercially available conventional coil and coil pusher system During in vivo testing the mechanically detachable coil design operated smoothly in the catheter providing good release and retraction in aneurysms and straight interlocking cylinder mechanically detachable coil design is superior to the other two tested designs The mechanically detachable coil was reliably delivered and detached in in vivo testing for the treatment of aneurysms and for the occlusion of blood vessels

Abstract Recent experimental and clinical reports suggest that the intracisternal administration of recombinant tissue plasminogen activator tPA within 72 hours of subarachnoid hemorrhage decreases the incidence of severe angiographic and clinical vasospasm In this report we present four of eight patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage who developed angiographic and clinical vasospasm with delayed neurological deterioration despite the use of intracisternal tPA after early aneurysm clipping One patient did not clear her massive subarachnoid hemorrhage with tPA one patient had extremely poor collateral flow with occlusion of one cervical internal carotid artery and 80 stenosis of the other cervical internal carotid artery the other two patients had a subarachnoid hemorrhage 7 to 12 days after their sentinel hemorrhage Three patients ultimately made excellent or good recoveries and one was left with hemiparesis The four other patients treated by this protocol did not develop vasospasm We conclude that intracisternal tPA may not prevent vasospasm in certain patients This may relate to inadequate clearing of the subarachnoid clot poor collateral supply or the

recurrent and multifocal tumors can be associated with greater risks stereotaxic radiosurgery was used to ablate hemangioblastomas in four patients with von disease In two of these cases a symptomatic lesion was surgically resected just prior to radiosurgery The 11 radiosurgically treated tumors four patients were spherical and varied in diameter from to cm with a mean of cm Dose ranged from 30 to 75 Gy with a mean of 35 Gy After a mean clinical and radiologic of greater than 1 years tumor size cyst formation was controlled in all cases Nevertheless it was necessary to temporarily shunt a tumor cyst in one patient In another case aggressive treatment resulted in symptomatic radiation necrosis Despite such potential problems we believe that radiosurgical tumor ablation is a reasonable alternative to craniotomy radiation therapy in poor risk patients This report is believed to be the first published description of the use of radiosurgery in the treatment of hemangioblastoma View

aneurysms were classified as giant lesions cm There were 85 upper basilar occlusions 41 lower basilar occlusions 29 bilateral vertebral occlusions and 48 unilateral vertebral artery occlusions The

excellent or good results were achieved in 64 of the patients with basilar apex 76 with basilar trunk 74 with vertebrobasilar junction and 87 with vertebral artery aneurysms Clinical outcome also varied depending on preoperative grade 86 of the patients with an excellent presenting grade achieved excellent results The size of the posterior communicating arteries was a good predictor of tolerance to basilar artery occlusion p Successful aneurysm thrombosis was achieved in 78 of the patients The neurological status in 26 patients 13 deteriorated due to vertebrobasilar ischemia occurring within the 1st postoperative week and thrombosis or embolism was implicated much more frequently than hemodynamic insufficiency Subarachnoid hemorrhage SAH in 14 patients vasospasm in five

Steinberg Panahian Maidment Newcomb 1993 15 4 Abstract Mild hypothermia has been recently proposed as a therapeutic approach for ameliorating ischaemic cerebral damage The protective potential of mild hypothermia however may be dependent on its ability to reduce the efflux of potentially excitotoxic amino acids and the severity of ischaemia In this study we examined the effects of mild brain hypothermia 33 degrees C in a rabbit model of permanent focal ischaemia In vivo microdialysis was used to measure extracellular amino acids in central and peripheral regions of the ischaemic cortex In normothermic ischaemia n 7 glutamate alanine taurine and phosphoethanolamine increased above baseline levels by about 2 h Mild hypothermia n 7 reduced glutamate efflux only in the central regions and increased alanine efflux in the peripheral regions of ischaemia There were no significant differences in other amino acid levels between the two temperature groups histology did not demonstrate hypothermic protection in the ischaemic hemisphere The lack of neuroprotection in this study may correspond with the sustained release of glutamate in the peripheral regions of ischaemia even with lowered brain temperature These results suggest that hypothermic reduction of excitotoxic perturbations may be more important in the ischaemic periphery than the core View details for Web of Science

focal cerebral ischaemia there is concern that the high doses necessary for neuroprotection may cause unacceptable adverse effects We studied the dose response characteristics of the clinically available NMDA antagonist dextromethorphan in a rabbit model of transient focal ischaemia anaesthetized rabbits underwent occlusion of the left internal carotid and anterior cerebral arteries for 1 h followed by h of reperfusion One hour after the onset of ischaemia they were treated with an infusion of varying doses of dextromethorphan or normal saline Seventeen additional unanaesthetized nonischaemic rabbits received similar infusions of dextromethorphan to correlate brain with blood levels and to evaluate adverse effects Rabbits with plasma dextromethorphan levels ng had a 64 reduction in ischaemic neuronal damage p those with levels 1500 ng showed 92 attenuation of neuronal damage and 65 decrease in ischaemic oedema p Drug levels suggest that dextromethorphan neuroprotection is not mediated by its active metabolite dextrorphan Unanaesthetized rabbits with plasma levels 2500 ng demonstrated severe gait ataxia These results demonstrate that systemic treatment with dextromethorphan after 1 h of focal ischaemia can significantly protect against cerebral damage if adequate plasma and brain levels are achieved Dextromethorphan was concentrated x in brain compared with plasma and brain levels were highly correlated with plasma levels r Neuroprotective doses of dextromethorphan were tolerated with only transient side effects View details for Web

cerebral ischemia In our study the influence of hypothermia was examined in a rabbit model of focal cerebral 4 hours of permanent ischemia induced by occlusion of the anterior and middle cerebral and internal carotid arteries somatosensory evoked potentials and regional cerebral blood flow were measured Ex vivo magnetic resonance imaging scans were also obtained to determine the degree of ischemic brain injury Three temperature temporalis muscle groups were studied 37 degrees C 33 degrees C and 30 degrees C n 5 per group An additional two animals were used to confirm that temporalis muscle temperatures were well correlated with brain temperature Rectal temperatures were kept constant degrees C in all 4 hours of focal ischemia evoked potentials in the normothermic animals remained depressed mean SEM preocclusion values Recovery of potentials was significantly enhanced in both hypothermic groups p less than 33 degrees C and 30 degrees C Quantitative magnetic resonance measurements showed that T1 and T2 relaxation times were increased in the core ischemic regions within the cortex and respectively These elevations in T1 and T2 were reduced by hypothermia However blood flow was not improved by lowered temperature in fact flow in the 30 degrees C group was significantly decreased compared with the other groups p less than There was no statistically significant correlation between specific cerebral blood flow values and T1 or T2 results demonstrate that hypothermia can improve evoked potentials and magnetic resonance parameters in permanent focal ischemia However moderate hypothermia 30 degrees C appears to also significantly decrease blood flow in the ischemic brain View details for Web of Science ID A1992HW86000018 View details for PubMedID 1595110 INTRANIDAL ANEURYSMS IN CEREBRAL EVALUATION AND ENDOVASCULAR TREATMENT RADIOLOGY Marks Lane Steinberg Snipes J 1992 183 2 Abstract Patients with cerebral arteriovenous malformations AVMs have an increased risk of hemorrhage if an intranidal aneurysm is present Angiograms from 125 patients with cerebral AVMs were evaluated and 15 12 had intranidal aneurysms All 15 patients had a history of bleeding Five patients underwent particulate or liquid embolization before surgical excision of or radiation therapy for the AVM All aneurysms were thrombosed at the time of embolization Ten patients underwent alone Eight of the 10 underwent angiographic mean 33 months seven patients showed complete obliteration of the AVM without residual aneurysm Histologic evaluation showed intranidal aneurysms to be vascular structures and they are the likely site for AVM hemorrhage Embolization is an effective method for achieving thrombosis of the intranidal aneurysm and may be beneficial in patients undergoing radiation therapy because of a long latency period between treatment and thrombosis of the AVM View details for Web of Science ID A1992HQ88400012 View details for PubMedID 1561335

FABRIKANT I 1992 22 1 Abstract alterations in cerebrovascular and metabolic function form the basis for the radiosurgical treatment of selected intracranial vascular malformations and tumors in human patients However the underlying mechanisms temporal progression and modifying factors involved in the radiosurgical obliteration of these intracranial lesions as well as the risks of delayed radiation injury to surrounding normal brain remain poorly understood In this report the rabbit brain was used as an animal model to examine the effects of on magnetic resonance imaging MRI appearance neurophysiologic function and histological integrity At approximately 10 weeks following irradiation with 60 Gy 225 kVp X rays MRI studies showed changes including barrier BBB perturbations in the white matter regions and the hippocampus Significant reductions in regional cerebral blood flow rCBF ratios were found in the hippocampus and certain regions of the cortex in irradiated animals However no changes in somatosensory evoked potentials SEP were observed Histological studies demonstrated telangiectatic vessels spreading edema in the white matter and focal regions of necrosis and hemorrhage in the irradiated cortices and hippocampi These results demonstrate that the irradiated rabbit brain may be used as an experimental model to correlate the spatiotemporal pattern of

intracranial vascular malformations Neurosurgery clinics of North America FABRIKANT Levy Steinberg Phillips Frankel Lyman Marks Silverberg 1992 3 1 Abstract Heavy radiation has unique physical characteristics that offer several advantages over photons and protons for stereotactic radiosurgery of intracranial AVMs These include improved dose distributions with depth in tissue small angle of lateral scattering and sharp distal of dose in the Bragg ionization peak Under approved clinical trials we have used stereotactic Bragg peak radiosurgery to treat approximately 400 patients with symptomatic surgically inaccessible vascular malformations at the synchrocyclotron and bevatron Treatment planning for stereotactic heavy radiosurgery for intracranial vascular disorders integrates anatomic and physical information from the stereotactic cerebral angiogram and stereotactic CT and MR imaging scans for each patient using computerized calculations for optimal isodose contour distribution The shape of an intracranial AVM is associated strongly with its treatability and potential clinical outcome In this respect heavy radiosurgery has distinct advantages over other radiosurgical methods the unique physical properties allow the shaping of individual beams to encompass the contours of large and complexly shaped AVMs while sparing important adjacent neural structures We have had a clinical protocol in collaboration with SUMC and UCSF and have followed up over 300 patients for more than 2 years Initially treatment doses ranged from 45 GyE to 35 GyE Currently total doses up to 25 GyE are delivered to treatment volumes ranging from cm3 to 70 cm3 This represents a relatively homogeneous dose distribution with the 90 isodose surface contoured to the periphery of the lesion there is considerable protection of normal adjacent brain tissues and most of the brain receives no radiation exposure Dose selection depends on the volume shape and location of the AVM and several other factors including the volume of normal brain that must be traversed by the plateau portion of the beam The first 230 patients have been evaluated clinically to the end of 1989 Using the clinical grading of Drake about 90 of the patients had an excellent or good neurologic grade about 5 had a poor grade and about 5 had progression of disease and died or died as a result of unrelated intercurrent illness Neuroradiologic to the end of 1989 indicated the following rates of complete angiographic obliteration 3 years after treatment 90 to 95 for AVM treatment volumes less than 4 cm3 90 to 95 for volumes 4 to 14 cm3 and 60 to 70 for volumes greater than 14 cm3 ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS View details for PubMedID 1633456 DEXTROMETHORPHAN ALTERS CEREBRAL AND PROTECTS

cerebral blood flow rCBF and cerebral injury were studied in a rabbit model of transient focal ischemia Anesthetized rabbits underwent 2 h occlusion of the left internal carotid middle cerebral and anterior cerebral artery followed by 4 h of reperfusion Ten minutes after the onset of ischemia they were treated with either DM 20 followed by 10 n 6 or normal saline NS n 5 Control rabbits received DM n 3 or NS n 2 infusion without arterial occlusion DM attenuated the sharp rise in rCBF seen during reperfusion within the ischemic core of NS controls DM 31 value NS 92 DM also improved the delayed hypoperfusion compared with controls DM infusion without arterial occlusion did not change rCBF values Compared with NS controls DM treated animals demonstrated recovery of the somatosensory evoked potential DM 96 values NS 24 76 reduction in cortical edema and 92 decrease in cortical ischemic neuronal damage We conclude that DM effect on CBF may contribute to its neuroprotective action View

characteristics of dextrorphan neuroprotective efficacy and side effects correlating these beneficial and adverse responses with plasma and brain levels in a rabbit model of transient focal cerebral ischemia rabbits anesthetized with halothane underwent occlusion of the left internal carotid and anterior cerebral arteries for 1 h followed by h of reperfusion One hour after the onset of ischemia they were treated with an infusion of varying dextrorphan doses or normal saline After killing the brains were analyzed for ischemic high signal intensity using magnetic resonance imaging MRI and for ischemic neuronal damage with histopathology A separate group of 12 anesthetized ischemic rabbits received similar doses of dextrorphan correlating plasma with brain dextrorphan levels additional dextrorphan unanesthetized nonischemic rabbits received infusions of dextrorphan to correlate behavioral side effects with dextrorphan dose and levels Compared with controls dextrorphan 15 group had significantly less cortical ischemic neuronal damage versus p and a reduction in cortical MRI high signal area versus p The dextrorphan 10 rabbits showed less cortical ischemic neuronal damage and less MRI high signal but this was not statistically significant p Dextrorphan 5 had no benefit on either neocortical ischemic neuronal damage or MRI high signal The protective effect of dextrorphan was correlated with plasma free dextrorphan levels r p less than for ischemic neuronal damage r p less than for ischemic MRI high signal All the rabbits with plasma levels greater than had less than 12 cortical ischemic neuronal damage and less than 34 MRI high signal All rabbits with plasma levels greater than showed less than 7 ischemic neuronal damage and less than 11 MRI high signal Plasma levels of approximately correlated with brain dextrorphan levels of approximately Unanesthetized rabbits with plasma levels of approximately demonstrated loss of the righting reflex These results demonstrate that systemic treatment with dextrorphan after 1 h focal ischemia can significantly protect against cerebral damage if adequate plasma and brain levels of dextrorphan are achieved The brain levels necessary to obtain in vivo protection are similar to concentrations that prevent glutamate or injury in neuronal culture View details for Web of Science ID A1991GL51500017 View details

nonshunted patients The classical form of medulloblastoma was present in 67 of cases while the desmoplastic subtype was found in 16 Survival rates were best for patients presenting after 1970 for those with desmoplastic tumors and for patients receiving irradiation greater than or equal to 5000 cGy to the posterior fossa Although early data on freedom from relapse suggested a possible beneficial effect from chemotherapy results showed no advantage from this modality of treatment The patterns of relapse and survival were examined 64 of relapses occurred within the central nervous system and Collins rule was applicable in 83 of cases beyond the period of risk Although patients treated for recurrent disease could be palliated none were survivors The study data indicate that

there are regional variations in degrees of neuronal cell injury edema and neuropil disruption These parameters of tissue injury were analyzed histopathologically in transient and permanent experimental cerebral ischemia in 15 rabbits and the results were spatially correlated with MR images of and postmortem brains MR was performed at T eight animals and at T seven animals Areas of high signal on MR images were closely correlated with histologic signs of cytotoxic glial edema and with disruption of the neuropil widening of the interstitial spaces in the background matrix of glial and neuronal cellular processes but MR tended to underestimate the extent of ischemic neuronal injury especially histologic changes mild neuronal shrinkage and nuclear basophilia ischemic neuronal changes were often found in the penumbra zone of ischemic lesions in areas that appeared normal on neuronal injury was also seen occasionally in areas of normal signal on MR especially in the striatum No significant differences were seen on MR between the experimental groups with respect to transient vs permanent occlusion in vivo vs in vitro MR and low vs high magnetic field In the setting of suspected acute cerebral ischemia an abnormal MR study often underestimates the extent of neuronal ischemic injury especially potentially reversible injury and a normal MR study does not completely

rabbit model of focal cerebral ischemia Rabbits were randomized to receive saline n 12 or glucose n 12 infusions The left anterior cerebral and left internal carotid arteries were clipped after the infusion began After 6 hours of occlusion the area of severe ischemic neuronal damage in the left neocortex and striatum on two standard sections of brain was calculated and expressed as a percentage of the total area of the left cortex or striatum The mean SEM cortical area of severe ischemic neuronal damage was in the rabbits and in the rabbits p less than The cortical area of severe ischemic neuronal damage was inversely correlated with plasma glucose concentration at the time of arterial clipping p less than We conclude that hyperglycemia is associated with decreased histologic neuronal

Hyperglycemia has been reported to worsen the tolerance of the brain to ischemia and it has therefore been recommended that patients undergoing neurosurgical procedures not receive solutions However whereas most animal studies have used global ischemia models most neurosurgical procedures are associated with risks of focal rather than global ischemia We therefore studied the effects of glucose administration in an animal model of focal cerebral ischemia We anesthetized 20 cats with halothane end tidal in oxygen and a focal cerebral ischemic lesion was produced by clip ligation of the left middle cerebral artery using a transorbital approach Hyperglycemia 10 cats mean SEM plasma glucose concentration 561 36 was established before ligation by infusion of 50 glucose in saline the control group 10 cats mean SEM plasma glucose concentration 209 28 received saline only Total fluid administered mean arterial blood pressure body temperature and arterial blood gas values did not differ between the two groups 0 2 and 6 hours after ligation The cats were killed 6 hours after ligation and the area of severe ischemic neuronal damage was determined by microscopic examination of a coronal section at the level of the optic chiasm The mean SEM area of left cortical severe ischemic neuronal damage was 12 2 of the left cortex in the hyperglycemic group compared with 28 5 in the control group p less than ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS View details for Web of Science ID A1989U149900014 View details for PubMedID 2929029 IMAGING OF VASCULAR COMPRESSION IN TRIGEMINAL NEURALGIA JOURNAL

9 Abstract We investigated dextromethorphan both a dextrorotatory opioid derivative and a clinically tested NMDA receptor antagonist in a rabbit model of transient focal cerebral ischemia Fourteen rabbits were randomly assigned to treatment with a 20 loading dose followed by a 10 infusion of dextromethorphan in normal saline or with an equivalent volume of normal saline alone One hour after treatment the rabbits underwent a occlusion of the left internal carotid and anterior cerebral arteries followed by 4 hours of reperfusion The seven rabbits showed a significant decrease in the area of neocortical severe ischemic neuronal damage compared with the seven normal controls p less than The rabbits also demonstrated significantly smaller areas of cortical edema on magnetic resonance imaging than the controls p less than Analysis of somatosensory evoked potentials revealed recovery of the ipsilateral amplitude to contralateral values within 5 minutes of reperfusion in the rabbits but not in the controls p less than In our rabbit model of transient focal cerebral ischemia dextromethorphan appears to protect the brain against ischemic neuronal damage and edema as well as to promote neurophysiologic recovery This clinically available drug should be further investigated as having potential therapeutic value in the treatment of stroke View details for PubMedID 3413809 MR OF

BOLUS OF LIDOCAINE IN FOCAL CANADIAN JOURNAL OF CANADIEN D ANESTHESIE Gelb Steinberg Lam Manninen Peerless RASSINETO A 1988 35 5 Abstract In order to determine the cerebral protective effects of an intravenous bolus of 5 of lidocaine the left middle cerebral artery MCA was transorbitally occluded in 19 cats Ten animals received the lidocaine bolus and nine a similar volume of saline immediately before MCA occlusion Somatosensory evoked potentials SEP were recorded before and after the lidocaine bolus as well as continually after MCA occlusion After six hours of vessel occlusion and without reperfusion the animals were sacrificed and the brains fixed for histology Prior to MCA occlusion lidocaine caused a statistically significant p less than reduction in the amplitude of the major cortical component of the SEP 10 microV vs microV Latency was unchanged In the lidocaine group SEP persisted in 40 per cent immediately following occlusion whereas they disappeared in all of the control animals p less than Gradual recovery occurred in both groups and there were no differences at the end of the experiment although the amplitudes tended to be greater in the lidocaine group There were no statistically significant differences in the histological size or severity of the infarcts between the groups Although infarct size was not reduced transient sparing of the SEP suggests that further studies of lidocaine by continuous infusion in models of temporary focal cerebral ischaemia may be warranted View details for Web of Science ID A1988Q313100011 View details for PubMedID

dextromethorphan DM and dextrorphan DX were found to reduce significantly neocortical severe ischemic neuronal damage SIND when administered in a delayed fashion after the ischemic insult Rabbits underwent occlusion of the left internal carotid artery and anterior cerebral artery for 1 h followed by 4 h of reperfusion Immediately after the completion of the 1 h arterial occlusion animals were blindly treated intravenously with 20 loading dose followed by 10 of DM 15 loading dose followed by 15 of DX or an equivalent volume of normal saline NS alone The area of neocortical SIND was in the DM group in the DX group and in the normal saline controls These drugs may have considerable therapeutic potential in clinical stroke View details for Web of Science ID A1988N893000014 View details

SOMATOSENSORY AND NEURONAL ISCHEMIC CHANGES FOLLOWING MIDDLE OCCLUSION STROKE Steinberg Gelb Lam Manninen Peerless Neto Floyd 1986 17 6 Abstract In an attempt to determine the usefulness of evoked potentials as a measure of focal cerebral ischemia we examined somatosensory evoked potentials SEP and morphological neuronal changes in cats following unilateral middle cerebral artery MCA occlusion Fifteen adult cats underwent transorbital occlusion of the MCA under halothane anesthesia In seven cats the ipsilateral SEP were abolished after middle cerebral artery occlusion and did not show any recovery after 6 hours The same seven cats showed the greatest area of moderate and severe ischemic neuronal changes ranging from 21 to 64 mean 39 14 of the total ipsilateral cortical area The remaining eight cats showed a complete flattening or decreased amplitude of the SEP after occlusion but demonstrated a considerable recovery in the amplitude of the primary cortical potential during the six hours of the study All these cats had ischemic areas of less than 15 mean 9 3 of the total ipsilateral cortex These results demonstrate that the disappearance of the SEP and their failure to recover correlate with the extent and degree of histological cerebral ischemia View details for Web of Science ID A1986F883300026 View details for PubMedID 3810720 AN UNUSUAL NEOPLASM OF THE WITH
