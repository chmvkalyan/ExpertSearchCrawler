Research and Scholarly Interests My laboratory uses the Drosophila male germ line as a model to investigate how proliferation and differentiation are regulated in adult stem cell lineages The central characteristic of adult stem cells is their capacity to divide as relatively undifferentiated precursors while also producing daughter cells that initiate differentiation Understanding the mechanisms that regulate stem cell specification and the choice between stem cell and differentiation is crucial for realizing the potential of stem cells for regenerative medicine We are using the Drosophila male germ line as a powerful genetic system to identify both the cell autonomous determinants and the extrinsic interactions that govern stem cell specification and differentiation One of the great advantages of this system is that stem cells can be studied in situ in the context of their normal support cells Our results indicate that signals from surrounding somatic support cells specify asymmetric division of male germ line stem cells by inducing one daughter cell to stem cell identity while directing the other daughter cell to differentiate A second focus of our work concerns how the developmental program directs cellular differentiation Fundamental cellular functions like the cell cycle the cytoskeleton and the general transcription machinery are remodeled during development to give rise to specialized cell types Several lines of research in our laboratory have recently converged on the molecular mechanisms underlying the developmentally programmed switch from proliferation to differentiation a key regulatory point in the adult stem cell lineages that underlie tissue maintenance and repair Failure to cleanly execute this switch may contribute to genesis of cancer Our results implicate a number of molecular and cellular mechanisms in regulating this critical switch We find that RNA binding proteins involved in translational control and alternative splicing act cell autonomously to regulate the cessation of proliferation and that progression of differentiation requires communication from associated somatic support cells We discovered that a developmentally regulated alternate choice of site at which certain nascent transcripts are cut to form 3 ends leading to production of novel mRNA isoforms with shortened 3 UTRs controls dramatic changes in the suite of proteins expressed in differentiating spermatocytes compared to proliferating spermatogonia We found that dramatic changes in chromatin open over 2000 new promoters with novel core sequence structure to turn on the new cell type specific transcription program when cells initiate spermatocyte differentiation Some of the earliest genes turned on in this differentiation program encode chromatin associated proteins that prevent spurious opening of normally cryptic promoters thus preventing massive misexpression of genes associated with the wrong cell type Other transcripts upregulated with differentiation onset encode cell translational regulators that delay production of core cell cycle machinery to program the extended G2 phase of meiotic prophase Our goal over the next 5 years is to map how these processes collaborate to form the regulatory circuitry that initiates then executes the switch from proliferation to differentiation Clinical Trials Testing

specialized cell types are key players in development and tissue regeneration One of the most dramatic changes in the transcription program in Drosophila occurs with the transition from proliferating spermatogonia to differentiating spermatocytes with 3000 genes either newly expressed or expressed from new alternative promoters in spermatocytes Here we show that opening of these promoters from their closed state in precursor cells requires function of the tMAC complex localized at the promoters The promoters lack the previously identified canonical core promoter elements except for the Inr Instead these promoters are enriched for the binding site for the homeodomain transcription factors and for a motif originally identified under tMAC peaks The tMAC motif resembles part of the previously identified Î²2UE1 element critical for expression Analysis of downstream sequences relative to transcription start site usage suggested that ACA and CNAAATT motifs at specific positions can help promote efficient transcription initiation Our results reveal how sequence elements that recruit and are acted upon by cell chromatin binding complexes help establish a robust cell transcription

Elias Scott 2018 11 547 Abstract A major limitation of targeted cancer therapy is the rapid emergence of drug resistance which often arises through mutations at or downstream of the drug target or through intrinsic resistance of subpopulations of tumor cells Medulloblastoma MB the most common pediatric brain tumor is no exception and MBs that are driven by sonic hedgehog SHH signaling are particularly aggressive and To find new drug targets and therapeutics for MB that may be less susceptible to common resistance mechanisms we used a developmental phosphoproteomics approach in murine granule neuron precursors GNPs the developmental cell of origin of MB The protein kinase CK2 emerged as a driver of hundreds of phosphorylation events during the proliferative stage of GNP growth including the phosphorylation of three of the eight proteins commonly amplified in MB CK2 was critical to the stabilization and activity of the transcription factor GLI2 a late downstream effector in SHH signaling CK2 inhibitors decreased the viability of primary MB patient cells in culture and blocked the growth of murine MB tumors that were resistant to currently available Hh inhibitors thereby extending the survival of mice Because of structural interactions one CK2 inhibitor inhibited both and mutant CK2 indicating that this drug may avoid at least one common mode of acquired resistance These findings suggest that CK2 inhibitors may be effective for treating patients with MB and show how phosphoproteomics may be used to gain insight into developmental biology and pathology View

6 Abstract The switch from mitosis to meiosis is the key event marking onset of differentiation in the germline stem cell lineage In Drosophila the translational repressor Bgcn is required for spermatogonia to stop mitosis and transition to meiotic prophase and the spermatocyte state Here we show that the mammalian Bgcn homolog YTHDC2 facilitates a clean switch from mitosis to meiosis in mouse germ cells revealing a conserved role for YTHDC2 in this critical cell fate transition male germ cells enter meiosis but have a mixed identity maintaining expression of Cyclin A2 and failing to properly express many meiotic markers Instead of continuing through meiotic prophase the cells attempt an abnormal division and die YTHDC2 binds multiple transcripts including Ccna2 and other mitotic transcripts binds specific piRNA precursors and interacts with RNA granule components suggesting that proper progression of germ cells through meiosis is licensed by YTHDC2 through regulation View

cell transcripts during development it is critical to maintain genes required for other lineages in a silent state Here we show in the Drosophila male germline stem cell lineage that a zinc finger protein Kumgang Kmg working with the chromatin remodeler prevents transcription of genes normally expressed only in somatic lineages By blocking transcription from normally cryptic promoters Kmg restricts activation by Aly a component of the arrest complex to transcripts for male germ cell differentiation Our results suggest that as new regions of the genome become open for transcription during terminal differentiation blocking the action of a promiscuous activator on cryptic promoters is a critical mechanism for specifying precise gene activation View details for DOI View details for

cycle dynamics of meiosis are controlled by layers of regulation imposed on core mitotic cell cycle machinery components by the program of germ cell development Although the mechanisms that regulate B activity in meiosis in oocytes have been well studied little is known about the factors responsible for developmental control of these factors in male gametogenesis During meiotic prophase in Drosophila males transcript for the core cell cycle protein Cyclin B1 CycB is expressed in spermatocytes but the protein does not accumulate in spermatocytes until just before the meiotic divisions Here we show that two interacting proteins Rbp4 and Fest expressed at the onset of spermatocyte differentiation under control of the developmental program of male gametogenesis function to direct cell and repression of translation of the core cell cycle component cycB during the specialized cell cycle of male meiosis Binding of Fest to Rbp4 requires a acid region within Rbp4 Rbp4 and Fest are required for translational repression of cycB in immature spermatocytes with Rbp4 binding sequences in a cell shortened form of the cycB 3 UTR Finally we show that Fest is required for proper

required for differentiation and not maintenance of germline stem cells in Drosophila testes PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA Lim Fuller 2012 109 45 Abstract Adult stem cells are believed to be maintained by a specialized microenvironment the niche which provides signals that either instruct stem cells to or inhibit execution of preprogrammed differentiation pathways In Drosophila testes somatic cyst stem cells CySCs and the apical hub form the niche for neighboring germline stem cells GSCs with CySCs as the proposed source of instructive signals Leatherman JL Dinardo S 2010 Nat Cell Biol 12 8 In contrast to this model we show that early germ cells with GSC characteristics can be maintained over time after ablation of CySCs and their cyst cell progeny Without CySCs and cyst cells early germ cells away from the hub failed to initiate differentiation Our results suggest that CySCs do not have a necessary instructive role in specifying GSC and that the differentiated progeny of CySCs provide an environment necessary to trigger GSC differentiation This work highlights the complex interaction between different stem cell populations in the same niche and how the state of one stem cell population can influence the fate of the other View details for DOI View details for Web of Science ID 000311156700055 View details for

STEM CELL Insco Bailey Kim Olivares Wapinski Tam Fuller 2012 11 5 Abstract In adult stem cell lineages progenitor cells commonly undergo mitotic transit amplifying TA divisions before terminal differentiation allowing production of many differentiated progeny per stem cell division Mechanisms that limit TA divisions and trigger the switch to differentiation may protect against cancer by preventing accumulation of oncogenic mutations in the proliferating population Here we show that the switch from TA proliferation to differentiation in the Drosophila male germline stem cell lineage is mediated by translational control The tumor suppressor homolog facilitates accumulation of the differentiation regulator Bam in TA cells In turn Bam and its partner Bgcn bind the 3 untranslated region and repress translation of in late TA cells Thus germ cells progress through distinct sequential regulatory states from off to Bam off homologs across species facilitate the switch from

asymmetrically to produce one stem cell and one differentiating cell thus maintaining both populations The asymmetric outcome of stem cell divisions can be specified by an oriented spindle and local signals from the stem cell niche Here we show that developmentally programmed asymmetric behavior and inheritance of mother and daughter centrosomes underlies the stereotyped spindle orientation and asymmetric outcome of stem cell divisions in the Drosophila male germ line The mother centrosome remains anchored near the niche while the daughter centrosome migrates to the opposite side of the cell

the niche and the mechanisms that ensure the correct balance between stem cell and differentiation is poorly understood Here we show that dividing Drosophila male germline stem cells use intracellular mechanisms involving centrosome function and cortically localized Adenomatous Polyposis Coli tumor suppressor protein to orient mitotic spindles perpendicular to the niche ensuring a reliably asymmetric outcome in which one daughter cell remains in the niche and stem cell identity whereas the other displaced away initiates differentiation View details for Web of Science ID 000185255300054

Abstract Active adult stem cells maintain a bipotential state with progeny able to either or initiate differentiation depending on extrinsic signals from the surrounding microenvironment However the intrinsic gene regulatory networks and chromatin states that allow adult stem cells to make these cell fate choices are not entirely understood Here we show that the transcription factor DNA Element Factor DREF regulates adult stem cell maintenance in the Drosophila male germline A allele of DREF described in this study genetically separated a role for DREF in germline stem cell from the general roles of DREF in cell proliferation The DREF allele caused defects in germline stem cell but allowed viability and division of germline stem cells as well as cell viability growth and division of somatic cyst stem cells in the testes and cells in the Drosophila eye Germline stem cells mutant for the temperature sensitive DREF allele exhibited lower activation of a reporter and their progeny turned on expression of the differentiation factor Bam prematurely Results of genetic interaction analyses revealed that and components of the Nucleosome Remodeling and Deacetylase NuRD complex

the complex Development Cambridge England Brantley Fuller 2019 Abstract Local signals and structural support from the surrounding cellular microenvironment play key roles in directing development in both embryonic organs and adult tissues In Drosophila male germ cells are intimately associated and with supporting somatic cells Here we show that function of the apical polarity complex in somatic cyst cells is required for survival of the germ cells they enclose Although spermatogonia enclosed by cyst cells in which function of the had been knocked down survive and proliferate newly formed spermatocytes enclosed by cyst cells lacking Par complex proteins died soon after onset of meiotic prophase Loss of Par complex function resulted in stage specific overactivation of the JNK pathway in cyst cells Knocking down expression of JNK pathway components or the GTPase Rab35 in cyst cells lacking Par complex function rescued survival of neighboring spermatocytes suggesting that action of the apical polarity complex ensures germ cell survival by preventing JNK pathway activation and that the mechanism by which cyst cells lacking Par complex function kill neighboring spermatocytes requires

new transcriptional programs required to make the appropriate differentiated cell type s In the Drosophila male germ line stem cell lineage the switch from proliferating spermatogonia to spermatocyte is accompanied by one of the most dramatic transcriptional changes in the fly as over 1000 new transcripts turn on in preparation for meiosis and spermatid differentiation Here we show that function

Cytokinesis in Drosophila melanogaster PLOS GENETICS Sechi Colotti Belloni Mattei Frappaolo Raffa Fuller Giansanti 2014 10 5 Abstract The highly conserved Golgi phosphoprotein 3 GOLPH3 protein has been described as a Phosphatidylinositol PI 4 P effector at the Golgi GOLPH3 is also known as a potent oncogene commonly amplified in several human tumors However the molecular pathways through which the oncoprotein GOLPH3 acts in malignant transformation are largely unknown GOLPH3 has never been involved in cytokinesis Here we characterize the Drosophila melanogaster homologue of human GOLPH3 during cell division We show that GOLPH3 accumulates at the cleavage furrow and is required for successful cytokinesis in Drosophila spermatocytes and larval neuroblasts In premeiotic spermatocytes GOLPH3 protein is required for maintaining the organization of Golgi stacks In dividing spermatocytes GOLPH3 is essential for both contractile ring and central spindle formation during cytokinesis Wild type function of GOLPH3 enables maintenance of centralspindlin and Rho1 at cell equator and stabilization of Myosin II and Septin rings We demonstrate that the molecular mechanism underlying GOLPH3 function in cytokinesis is strictly dependent on the ability of this protein to interact with PI 4 Mutations that abolish PI 4 P binding impair recruitment of GOLPH3 to both the Golgi and the cleavage furrow Moreover telophase cells from mutants with defective 4 P interaction fail to accumulate PI 4 secretory organelles at the cleavage site Finally we show that GOLPH3 protein interacts with components of both cytokinesis and membrane trafficking machineries in Drosophila cells Based on these results we propose that GOLPH3 acts as a key molecule to coordinate phosphoinositide signaling with actomyosin dynamics and vesicle trafficking during cytokinesis Because cytokinesis failures have been associated with premalignant disease and cancer our studies suggest novel insight

In Drosophila spermatocytes the transcription of many of these translationally delayed mRNAs during spermiogenesis is in turn directly or indirectly regulated by homologs of factors tTAFs Here we present evidence that expression of Mst77F which is a specialized linker component of sperm chromatin and of protamine B ProtB which contributes to formation of condensed sperm chromatin is regulated at three levels Transcription of Mst77F is guided by a short region while expression of the Mst77F protein is regulated at two levels early by translational repression via sequences mainly in the 5 part of the ORF and later by either protein stabilization or translational activation dependent on sequences in the ORF The protB gene is a direct target of tTAFs with very short upstream regulatory regions of protB to bp sufficient for both transcription and repression of translation in spermatocytes In addition efficient accumulation of the ProtB protein in late elongating spermatids depends on sequences in the ORF We present evidence that spermatocytes provide the transacting mechanisms for translational repression of these mRNAs while spermatids contain the machinery to activate or stabilize protamine accumulation for sperm chromatin components Thus the proper spatiotemporal expression pattern of major sperm chromatin components depends on mechanisms of transcriptional and translational control View details for DOI View details for Web of Science ID 000318757300004 View details for PubMedID 23466740 View details for PubMedCentralID PMC4154633 The transcriptional

Fuller 2012 69 11 Abstract Cytokinesis separates the genomic material and organelles of a dividing cell equitably into two physically distinct daughter cells at the end of cell division This highly choreographed process involves coordinated reorganization and regulated action of the actin and microtubule cytoskeletal systems an assortment of motor proteins and membrane trafficking components Due to their large size the ease with which exquisite cytological analysis may be performed on them and the availability of numerous mutants and other genetic tools Drosophila spermatocytes have provided an excellent system for exploring the mechanistic basis for the temporally programmed and precise spatially localized events of cytokinesis Mutants defective in male meiotic cytokinesis can be easily identified in forward genetic screens by the production of multinucleate spermatids In addition the weak spindle assembly checkpoint in spermatocytes which causes only a small delay of anaphase onset in the presence of unattached chromosomes allows investigation of whether gene products required for spindle assembly and chromosome segregation are also involved in cytokinesis Perhaps due to the large size of spermatocytes and the requirement for two rounds of division without intervening S or growth phases during meiosis male meiotic mutants have also revealed much about molecular mechanisms underlying new membrane addition during cytokinesis Finally cell differences in the events that set up and complete cytokinesis are emerging from comparison of spermatocytes with cells undergoing

between adult stem cells and niche cells or the local basement membrane ensures retention of stem cells in the niche environment Drosophila male germline stem cells GSCs attach to somatic hub cells a component of their niche through adherens junctions and orient their centrosomes toward these localized junctional complexes to carry out asymmetric divisions Here we show that the transmembrane receptor tyrosine phosphatase Lar which is best known for its function in axonal migration and synapse morphogenesis in the nervous system helps maintain GSCs at the hub by promoting adhesion between hub cells and GSCs Lar is expressed in GSCs and early spermatogonial cells and localizes to the interface Loss of Lar function resulted in a reduced number of GSCs at the hub Lar function was required in germ cells for proper localization of Adenomatous polyposis coli 2 and at the interface and for the proper orientation of centrosomes in GSCs Ultrastructural analysis revealed that in Lar mutants

we investigate how the developmental program reverses local PcG action to allow expression of terminal differentiation genes in the Drosophila male germline stem cell GSC lineage We find that the

global downregulation of Polycomb repressive complex 2 PRC2 components recruitment of hypophosphorylated RNA polymerase II Pol II to promoters as well as the expression and action of homologs of

adult stem cells reside in a special microenvironment known as the niche where they receive essential signals that specify stem cell identity adhesion mediated by cadherin and integrin plays a crucial role in maintaining stem cells within the niche In Drosophila melanogaster male germline stem cells GSCs are attached to niche component cells the hub via adherens junctions The GSC centrosomes and

several cellular contexts and LINC complexes formed by SUN and KASH proteins are crucial in this process Here we characterize the presumed Drosophila ortholog of the mammalian SUN protein antigen 4 Spag4 previously named Giacomo and demonstrate that Spag4 is required for centriole and nuclear attachment during spermatogenesis Production of spag4 mRNA is limited to the testis and Spag4 protein shows a dynamic pattern of association with the germline nuclei including a concentration of protein at the site of attachment of the single spermatid centriole In the absence of Spag4 nuclei and centrioles or basal bodies BBs dissociate from each other after meiosis This role of Spag4 in centriolar attachment does not involve either of the two KASH proteins of the Drosophila genome Klarsicht

one end and sperm tail growth occurring at the other Remarkably little is known about the signals that drive spermatid polarity and elongation Here we identify phosphoinositides as critical regulators of these processes Reduction of plasma membrane phosphatidylinositol PIP 2 by expression of the PIP 2 phosphatase SigD or mutation of the PIP 2 biosynthetic enzyme Skittles Sktl results in dramatic defects in spermatid cysts which become bipolar and fail to fully elongate Defects in polarity are evident from the earliest stages of elongation indicating that phosphoinositides are required for establishment of polarity Sktl and PIP 2 localize to the growing end of the cysts together with the exocyst complex Strikingly the exocyst becomes completely delocalized when PIP 2 levels are reduced and overexpression of Sktl restores exocyst localization and spermatid cyst polarity Moreover the exocyst is required for polarity as partial loss of function of the exocyst subunit Sec8 results in

of Drosophila MOLECULAR BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION Li Davis Lenkov Bolival Fuller Petrov A 2009 26 5 Abstract The basal transcription machinery is responsible for initiating transcription at core promoters During metazoan evolution its components have expanded in number and diversified to increase the complexity of transcriptional regulation in tissues and developmental stages To explore the evolutionary events and forces underlying this diversification we analyzed the evolution of the Drosophila testis TAFs factors paralogs of TAFs from the basal transcription factor TFIID that are essential for normal transcription during spermatogenesis of a large set of specific genes involved in terminal differentiation of male gametes There are five TAFs in Drosophila each expressed only in primary spermatocytes and each a paralog of a different generally expressed TFIID subunit An examination of the presence of paralogs across taxa as well as molecular clock dating indicates that all five testis TAFs likely arose within a span of approximately 38 My Ma by independent duplication events from their generally expressed paralogs Furthermore the evolution of the testis TAFs has been rapid with apparent further accelerations in multiple Drosophila lineages Analysis of divergence and intraspecies polymorphism indicates that the major forces of evolution on these genes have been reduced purifying selection pervasive positive selection and coevolution Other genes that exhibit similar patterns of evolution in the Drosophila lineages are also characterized by enriched expression

Yamashita 2008 456 7222 Abstract Asymmetric division of adult stem cells generates one stem cell and one differentiating cell thereby maintaining tissue homeostasis A decline in stem cell function has been proposed to contribute to tissue ageing although the underlying mechanism is poorly understood Here we show that changes in the stem cell orientation with respect to the niche during ageing contribute to the decline in spermatogenesis in the male germ line of Drosophila Throughout the cell cycle centrosomes in germline stem cells GSCs are oriented within their niche and this ensures asymmetric division We found that GSCs containing misoriented centrosomes accumulate with age and that these GSCs are arrested or delayed in the cell cycle The cell cycle arrest is transient and GSCs appear to the cell cycle on correction of centrosome orientation On the basis of these findings we propose that cell cycle arrest associated with centrosome misorientation functions as a mechanism to ensure asymmetric stem cell division and that the inability of stem cells to maintain correct orientation during ageing contributes to the decline in spermatogenesis We also show that some of the misoriented GSCs probably originate from dedifferentiation of spermatogonia View details for DOI View details for Web of Science ID 000261340000032 View details for PubMedID 18923395 A role for fatty

cells at late stages of division the contractile ring frequently detaches from the cortex and constricts or collapses to one side of the cell and the cleavage furrow regresses Our findings implicate

involving the localized reorganization of cortical actin which must be tightly linked with chromosome segregation operated by the mitotic spindle How this multistep process is coordinated remains poorly understood In this study we show that the linker moesin the single ERM ezrin radixin and moesin protein in Drosophila melanogaster is required to maintain cortical stability during mitosis Mitosis onset is characterized by a burst of moesin activation mediated by a Slik phosphorylation Activated moesin homogenously localizes at the cortex in prometaphase and is progressively restricted at the equator in later stages Lack of moesin or inhibition of its activation destabilized the cortex throughout mitosis resulting in severe cortical deformations and abnormal distribution of actomyosin regulators Inhibiting moesin activation also impaired microtubule organization and precluded stable positioning of the mitotic spindle We propose that the spatiotemporal control of moesin

cells physically attach to the niche via localized adherens junctions that provide a polarity cue for orientation of centrosomes in interphase and the spindle in mitosis As a result stem cells divide

mutant for eIF4G2 are viable and female fertile but male sterile Spermatocytes form but the germ cells in mutant males skip the major events of the meiotic divisions and form aberrant spermatids with large nuclei Consistent with the failure to undergo the meiotic divisions function of eIF4G2 is required for normal accumulation of the core cell cycle regulatory proteins Twine and CycB in mature

the ability of stem cell daughters to differentiate into highly specialized cells depend on external cues provided by their cellular microenvironments However how microenvironments are shaped is poorly understood In testes of Drosophila melanogaster germ cells are enclosed by somatic support cells This physical interrelationship depends on signaling from germ cells to the Epidermal growth factor receptor Egfr on somatic support cells 4 We show that germ cells signal via the Egf class ligand Spitz Spi and provide evidence that the Egfr associates with and acts through the guanine nucleotide exchange factor Vav to regulate activities of Rac1 Reducing activity of the Egfr Vav or Rac1 from somatic support cells enhanced the germ cell enclosure defects of a conditional spi allele Conversely reducing activity of Rho1 from somatic support cells suppressed the germ cell enclosure defects of the conditional spi allele We propose that a differential in Rac and Rho activities across somatic support cells guides their growth around the germ cells Our novel findings reveal how signals from one cell type regulate changes in another to establish a critical partnership required for

Deletion of yeast Sps1 a member of the Ste20 family of kinases nearly abolishes the H4 S1ph modification H4 S1ph may promote chromatin compaction since deletion of SPS1 increases accessibility to antibody immunoprecipitation furthermore either deletion of Sps1 or an H4 S1A substitution results in increased DNA volume in nuclei within spores We find H4 S1ph present during Drosophila melanogaster and mouse spermatogenesis and similar to yeast this modification extends late into sperm differentiation relative to H3 S10ph Thus H4 S1ph may be an evolutionarily ancient histone

Giansanti Bonaccorsi Kurek Farkas Dimitri Fuller Gatti 2006 16 2 Abstract Phosphatidylinositol transfer proteins PITPs are highly conserved polypeptides that bind phosphatidylinositol or phosphatidylcholine monomers facilitating their transfer from one membrane compartment to another Although PITPs have been implicated in a variety of cellular functions including signaling and membrane trafficking the precise biological roles of most PITPs remain to be elucidated Here we show for the first time that a class I PITP is involved in cytokinesis We found that giotto gio a Drosophila gene that encodes a class I PITP serves an essential function required for both mitotic and meiotic cytokinesis Neuroblasts and spermatocytes from gio mutants both assemble regular actomyosin rings However these rings fail to constrict to completion leading to cytokinesis failures Moreover gio mutations cause an abnormal accumulation of vesicles at the equator of spermatocyte telophases suggesting that Gio is implicated in fusion Consistent with these results we found that Gio is enriched at the cleavage furrow the ER and the spindle envelope We propose that Gio mediates transfer of lipid monomers from the ER to the equatorial membrane causing a specific local enrichment in phosphatidylinositol This change in membrane composition would ultimately facilitate vesicle fusion allowing membrane addition to the furrow targeted delivery of proteins required for cytokinesis View details for DOI View details for Web of Science ID 000235105900025 View details for PubMedID

and differentiating cell populations is critical for the maintenance of tissue renewal for cell types derived from adult stem cell lineages such as blood skin intestinal epithelium and sperm To keep this balance stem cells have the potential to divide asymmetrically producing one daughter cell that maintains stem cell identity and one daughter cell that initiates differentiation In many adult stem cell systems the maintenance proliferation and number of stem cells appear to be controlled by the microenvironment or niche The Drosophila male and female germ line provide excellent model systems in which to study asymmetric stem cell divisions within the stem cell niche In addition to signals from the niche that specify stem cell the stem cells themselves have elaborate cellular

that initiate differentiation along a specific lineage Studies using the Drosophila germline as a model system have demonstrated that signaling from the stem cell niche plays a crucial role in controlling stem cell behavior Surrounding support cells secrete growth factors that activate signaling within adjacent stem cells to specify stem cell and block differentiation In addition adhesion between stem cells and surrounding support cells is important for holding stem cells close to signals Furthermore a combination of localized signaling and autonomously acting proteins might polarize stem cells in such a way as to ensure asymmetric stem cell divisions Recent results describing stem cell niches in other adult stem cells including hematopoietic and neural stem cells have

encodes a homolog of a factor dTAF5 protein expressed only in spermatocytes where it is required for normal transcription of genes required for spermatid differentiation We show that Drosophila primary spermatocytes also express four additional TAFs nht homolog of dTAF4 mia homolog of dTAF6 sa homolog of dTAF8 and rye homolog of dTAF12 Mutations in nht mia and sa have similar effects in primary spermatocytes on transcription of several target genes involved in spermatid differentiation and cause the same phenotypes as mutations in can blocking both meiotic cell cycle progression and

differentiation Here we utilize the Drosophila system to identify genes that cause defects in the male GSC lineage when forcibly expressed We conducted a screen using a collection of 2050 EP lines and found 55 EP lines that caused defects at early stages of spermatogenesis upon forced expression either in germ cells or in surrounding somatic support cells Most strikingly our analysis of forced expression indicated that repression of bam expression in male GSC is important for male GSC survival while activity of the TGF beta signal transduction pathway may play a permissive role in maintenance of GSCs in Drosophila testes In addition forced activation of the TGF beta signal transduction pathway in germ cells inhibits the transition from the spermatogonial mitotic amplification

mechanism Drosophila mutants defective in meiotic cytokinesis can be easily identified by their multinucleate spermatids Moreover the large size of meiotic spindles allows characterization of mutant phenotypes with exquisite cytological resolution We have screened a collection of 1955 homozygous mutant male sterile lines for those with multinucleate spermatids and thereby identified mutations in 19 genes required for cytokinesis These include 16 novel loci and three genes diaphanous four wheel drive and pebble already known to be involved in Drosophila cytokinesis To define the primary defects leading to failure of cytokinesis we analyzed meiotic divisions in male mutants for each of these 19 genes Examination of preparations stained for tubulin anillin KLP3A and revealed discrete defects in the components of the cytokinetic apparatus suggesting that these genes act at four major points in a stepwise pathway for cytokinesis Our results also indicated that the central spindle and the contractile ring are interdependent structures that interact throughout cytokinesis Moreover our genetic and cytological analyses provide further evidence for a cell control of Drosophila

Abstract A robust developmentally regulated and cell type specific transcriptional programme is activated in primary spermatocytes in preparation for differentiation of the male gametes during spermatogenesis Work in Drosophila is beginning to reveal the genetic networks that regulate this gene expression The Drosophila meiotic arrest loci are essential for activation of transcription of many genes as well as several genes important for meiotic cell cycle progression thus linking meiotic cell cycle progression to cellular differentiation during spermatogenesis The three previously described proteins aly comr and form a complex and are associated with chromatin in primary spermatocytes We identify clone and characterize a new meiotic arrest gene matotopetli topi which encodes a protein that physically interacts with Comr The topi mutant phenotype is most like in that topi function is not required for the nuclear localization of Aly or Comr but is required for their accumulation on chromatin Most target genes in the transcriptional programme depend on both topi and however a small subset of target genes are differentially sensitive to loss of topi or suggesting

may regulate mitochondrial morphogenesis and underlie complementation between mitochondrial genomes in mammalian cells The nuclear encoded mitochondrial proteins Mfn1 and Mfn2 are human homologues of the only known protein mediators of mitochondrial fusion the Drosophila Fzo GTPase and Saccharomyces cerevisiae yFzo1p Although the Mfn1 and Mfn2 genes were broadly expressed the two genes showed different levels of mRNA expression in different tissues Two Mfn1 transcripts were detected at similar levels in a variety of human tissues and were dramatically elevated in heart while Mfn2 mRNA was abundantly expressed in heart and muscle tissue but present only at low levels in many other tissues Human Mfn1 protein localized to mitochondria and participated in a high molecular weight detergent extractable protein complex Forced expression of Mfn1 in cultured cells caused formation of characteristic networks of mitochondria Introduction of a point mutation in the conserved G1 region of the predicted GTPase domain Mfn1K88T dramatically decreased formation of mitochondrial networks upon Mfn1 overexpression suggesting that network formation required completion of the Mfn1 GTPase cycle Conversely a protein variant carrying a point mutation in the G2 motif of the Mfn1 GTPase domain acted as a dominant negative overexpression of Mfn1T109A resulted in fragmentation of mitochondria We propose that Mfn1T109A interferes with fusion activity of endogenous Mfn1 protein possibly by binding necessary cofactors so to allow unopposed mitochondrial fission Thus Mfn1 appears to be a key

Abstract The multisubunit conserved oligomeric Golgi COG complex has been shown previously to be involved in Golgi function in yeast and mammalian tissue culture cells Despite this broad conservation several subunits including Cog5 were not essential for growth and showed only mild effects on secretion when mutated in yeast raising questions about what functions these COG complex subunits play in the life of the cell Here we show that function of the gene four way stop fws which encodes the Drosophila Cog5 homologue is necessary for dramatic changes in cellular and subcellular morphology during spermatogenesis mutations in fws caused failure of cleavage furrow ingression in dividing spermatocytes and failure of cell elongation in differentiating spermatids and disrupted the formation stability of the spermatid acroblast Consistent with the lack of a growth defect in yeast lacking Cog5 animals lacking fws function were viable although males were sterile Fws protein localized to Golgi structures throughout spermatogenesis We propose that Fws may directly or indirectly facilitate efficient vesicle traffic through the Golgi to support rapid and extensive increases in cell

up the special relationship between germ cells and somatic support cells and the signals that mediate the crucial communications between the two cell types are poorly understood We show that interactions between germ cells and somatic support cells in Drosophila depend on function of the stet gene In males stet acts in germ cells to allow their encapsulation by somatic cyst cells and is required for germ cell differentiation In females stet function allows inner sheath cells to enclose early germ cells correctly at the tip of the germarium stet encodes a homolog of rhomboid a component of the epidermal growth factor receptor signaling pathway involved in ligand activation in the signaling cell The stet mutant phenotype suggests that stet facilitates signaling from germ

growth zpg locus of Drosophila encodes a gap junction protein Innexin 4 that is required for survival of differentiating early germ cells during gametogenesis in both sexes Animals with a null mutation in zpg are viable but sterile and have tiny gonads Adult gonads contain small numbers of early germ cells resembling stem cells or early spermatogonia or oogonia but lack later stages of germ

surfaces both those adjacent to surrounding somatic cells and those adjacent to other germ cells We propose that gap junctional hemichannels in the germ cell plasma membrane may connect with

Abstract Stem cells maintain populations of highly differentiated including blood skin and sperm throughout adult life Understanding the mechanisms that regulate stem cell behaviour is crucial for realizing their potential in regenerative medicine A fundamental characteristic of stem cells is their capacity for asymmetric division daughter cells either retain stem cell identity or initiate

present evidence that support cells surrounding the stem cells restrict and control stem cell number by ensuring asymmetric division Loss of function of the Drosophila Epidermal growth factor receptor

coordinate the onset of spermatid differentiation with meiosis I in Drosophila DEVELOPMENT Schafer Alphey Fuller 1998 125 1 Abstract The aly can mia and sa genes of Drosophila are essential in males both for the I transition and for onset of spermatid differentiation Function of all four genes is required for transcription in primary spermatocytes of a suite of spermatid differentiation genes aly is also required for transcription of the cell cycle control genes cyclin B and twine in primary spermatocytes In contrast can mia and sa are required for accumulation of twine protein but not twine transcript We propose that the can mia and sa gene products act together or in a pathway to turn on transcription of spermatid differentiation genes and that aly acts upstream of can mia and sa to regulate spermatid differentiation We also propose that control of translation or protein stability regulates entry into the first meiotic division We suggest that a gene or genes transcribed under the control of can mia and sa allow s accumulation of twine protein thus coordinating meiotic division with onset of spermatid differentiation View details for Web of Science ID 000071652400013 View

Tub23C in Drosophila Zheng et 1991 We now report identification of a second gene gamma Tub37CD Immunoblot analysis and immunolocalization show that gamma Tub37CD and gamma Tub23C are differentially expressed during gametogenesis and development During oogenesis gamma Tub23C was detected at centrosomes and in the cytoplasm of mitotic germ cells but was not detected in germ cells following completion of mitosis Conversely gamma Tub37CD was not detected in proliferating germ cells but appeared to accumulate in germ cells during egg chamber development Neither isoform was detected at the anterior or posterior poles of developing oocytes During spermatogenesis only gamma Tub23C was detected at centrosomes where it showed cell and organization During the transition into the first meiotic division gamma Tub23C became organized as a corpuscular focus at centrioles until completion of meiosis II During postmeiotic spermatid differentiation gamma Tub23C was detected first as a rod and then as a structure near the juncture of the nucleus and the elongating flagellum but was not detected in bundles of mature sperm The CDC25 encoded by twine is required for organization of gamma Tub23C into corpuscular focus in spermatocytes but not for separation of centriole pairs in or postmeiotic organization of gamma Tub23C at centrioles Following reconstitution of a canonical centrosome at fertilization only gamma Tub37CD was detected at centrosomes in syncytial embryos but both gamma Tub37CD and gamma Tub23C were detected at centrosomes in cellularized embryos Colocalization of

mitotic spindle assembly is the view that centrosomes are essentially permanent structures Yet immunofluorescence revealed that spindles in larval brains of urchin mutants in Drosophila were frequently monastral but bipolar the astral pole contained a centrosome while the opposing anastral pole showed neither gamma tubulin nor a radial array of astral microtubules Thus mutations in the urchin gene seem to uncouple centrosome organization and spindle bipolarity in mitotic cells Hypomorphic mutants showed a high frequency of monastral bipolar spindles but low frequencies of polyploidy suggesting that monastral bipolar spindles might be functional To test this hypothesis we performed pedigree analysis of centrosome distribution and spindle structure in the four mitotic divisions of gonial cells Prophase gonial cells showed two centrosomes suggesting cells entered mitosis with the normal number of centrosomes and that centrosomes separated during prophase Despite a high frequency of monastral bipolar spindles the end products of the four mitotic divisions were equivalent in size and chromatin content These results indicate that monastral bipolar spindles are functional and that the daughter cell derived from the anastral pole can assemble a functional bipolar spindle in the subsequent cell cycle Cell proliferation despite high frequencies of monastral bipolar spindles can be explained if centrosome structure in mitotic cells is dynamic allowing transient and benign disorganization of pericentriolar components Since urchin proved to be allelic to KLP61F which encodes a kinesin related motor protein Heck et al 1993 J Cell Biol 123 our results suggest that motors influence the dynamic organization of centrosomes View details for Web of Science ID

Abstract Stable intercellular bridges called ring canals form following incomplete cytokinesis and interconnect mitotically or meiotically related germ cells We show that ring canals in Drosophila melanogaster males are surprisingly different from those previously described in females Mature ring canal walls in males lack actin and appear to derive directly from structural proteins associated with the contractile ring Ring canal assembly in males as in females initiates during cytokinesis with the appearance of a ring of phosphotyrosine epitopes at the site of the contractile ring Following constriction actin and myosin II disappear However at least four proteins present at the contractile ring remain the three septins Pnut Sep1 and Sep2 and anillin In sharp contrast in ovarian ring canals septins have not been detected anillin is lost from mature ring canals and filamentous actin is a major component In both males and females a highly branched vesicular structure termed the fusome interconnects developing germ cells via the ring canals and is thought to coordinate mitotic germ cell divisions We show that in males unlike females the fusome persists and enlarges following cessation of the mitotic divisions developing additional branches during meiosis During differentiation the fusome and its associated ring canals localize to the distal tip of the elongating

males DEVELOPMENT Lin Viswanathan Wood Wilson Wolf Fuller 1996 122 4 Abstract function of four Drosophila genes spermatocyte arrest cannonball always early and meiosis I arrest is required both for progression through the transition of meiosis I in males and for onset of spermatid differentiation In males mutant for any one of these meiotic arrest genes mature primary spermatocytes with partially condensed chromosomes accumulate and postmeiotic cells are lacking The arrest in progression occurs prior to degradation of cyclin A protein The block in spermatogenesis in these mutants is not simply a secondary consequence of meiotic arrest as spermatid differentiation proceeds in males mutant for the cell cycle activating phosphatase twine Instead the arrest of both meiosis and spermiogenesis suggests a control point that may serve to coordinate the male meiotic cell cycle with the spermatid differentiation program The phenotype of the Drosophila meiotic arrest mutants is strikingly similar to the histopathological features of meiosis I maturation arrest infertility in human males suggesting that the control point may be conserved from flies to man View details for Web

of Drosophila melanogaster fails to complement mutations in an locus alpha 1t mutations in a locus B2t or a mutation in the haywire locus However wrl fails to map to any of the known or genes The extragenic failure to complement could indicate that the wrl product participates in structural interactions with microtubule proteins The whirligig locus appears to be haploinsufficient for male fertility Both a deficiency of wrl and possible loss of function alleles obtained by reverting the failure to complement between wrlnc4 and B2tn are dominant male sterile in a genetic background wild type for tubulin The dominant male sterility of the revertant alleles is suppressed if the flies are also heterozygous for B2tn for a deficiency of alpha 1t or for the haync2 allele These results suggest that it is not the absolute level of wrl gene product but its level relative to tubulin or microtubule function that is important for normal spermatogenesis The phenotype of homozygous wrl mutants suggests that the whirligig product plays a role in postmeiotic spermatid differentiation possibly in organizing the microtubules of the sperm flagellar axoneme Flies homozygous for either wrlnc4 or revertant alleles are viable and female fertile but male sterile Premeiotic and meiotic stages of spermatogenesis appear normal However in stages flagellar axonemes show loss of the

Regan Fuller 1990 125 1 Abstract The recessive male sterile mutation haync2 of Drosophila melanogaster fails to complement certain beta and mutations suggesting that the haywire product plays a role in microtubule function perhaps as a structural component of microtubules The genetic interaction appears to require the presence of the aberrant product encoded by haync2 which may act as a structural poison Based on this observation we have isolated ten new mutations that revert the failure to complement between haync2 and B2tn The revertants tested behaved as intragenic mutations of hay in recombination tests and fell into two phenotypic classes suggesting two functional domains of the hay gene product Some revertants were hemizygous viable and less severe than haync2 in their recessive phenotype These mutations might revert the poison by restoring the aberrant product encoded by the haync2 allele to more function Most of the revertants were recessive lethal mutations indicating that the hay gene product is essential for viability These more extreme mutations could revert the poison by destroying the ability of the aberrant haywirenc2 product to interact structurally with microtubules Flies heterozygous for the original haync2 allele and an extreme revertant show defects in both the structure and the function of the male meiotic spindle View details

genes that encode interacting structural proteins A mutation nc33 identified because it failed to complement mutant alleles of the gene encoding the beta of Drosophila melanogaster B2t did not map to the B2t locus We show that this noncomplementing mutation is a missense mutation in that results in substitution of methionine in place of valine at amino acid 177 Because and form a heterodimer our results suggest that the genetic interaction failure to complement is based on the structural interaction between the protein products of the two genes Although the nc33 mutation failed to complement a null allele of B2t B2tn a deletion of the gene to which nc33 mapped complemented B2tn Thus the failure to complement appears to require the presence of the altered encoded by the nc33 allele which may act as a structural poison when incorporated into either the tubulin heterodimer or microtubules View details for Web of Science ID A1989T444300001 View details for PubMedID 2498648 INTERACTING

arrays Kemphues et 1982 Two recessive mutations in the B2t locus that encode partially functional stable variant forms of beta 2 tubulin cause defects in only certain processes during spermatogenesis These mutations could thus identify aspects of beta tubulin primary structure critical for function only in specific microtubule arrays In males carrying the B2t6 mutation meiotic chromosome segregation and nuclear shaping are normal and flagellar axonemes are formed but there is a subtle defect in axoneme structure the outer doublet microtubules fill in with a central core normally seen only in the central pair and accessory microtubules In homozygous B2t7 males chromosome movement is usually normal during meiosis but cytokinesis often fails cytoplasmic microtubules are assembled and nuclear shaping appears to be normal but the flagellar axoneme lacks structural integrity In contrast the B2t8 allele affects a general property of tubulin the ability to form normal association of protofilaments Fuller et 1987 and causes defects in meiosis axoneme assembly and nuclear shaping Certain combinations of these beta 2 tubulin mutations show interallelic complementation in males functional sperm are produced and both variant subunits are incorporated into mature sperm in the absence of beta 2 tubulin Comparison of the phenotypes of the three partially functional beta 2

REVEALED BY DISTRIBUTION OF A TUBULIN ISOFORM DEVELOPMENT Wolf Regan Fuller 1988 102 2 Abstract Immunofluorescence staining of Drosophila embryos with a monoclonal antibody specific for acetylated has revealed that acetylated and nonacetylated isoforms have different patterns of distribution during early development Acetylated was not detected in either interphase or mitotic spindle microtubules during the rapid early cleavage or syncytial blastoderm divisions Acetylated was first observed as interphase lengthened at the end of syncytial blastoderm and at cycle 14 was localized to a ring of structures clustered around the interphase nuclei These structures probably represent a set of stable microtubules involved in nuclear elongation Absence of detectable acetylated prior to cellular blastoderm seems to be due to rapid turnover of microtubule arrays rather than to lack of the enzyme required for modification since acetylated appeared in early embryos when were stabilized by taxol treatment or anoxia Because acetylated seems to be characteristic of stable microtubule arrays the appearance of the antigen at cycle 14 represents a fundamental change in microtubule behaviour in the somatic cells of the embryo Acetylated was not detected in pole cells during the blastoderm or early gastrula stages indicating that acetylation of is not merely a consequence of cellularization After the onset of gastrulation interphase microtubule arrays in most cell types contain acetylated However cells in mitosis lack antibody staining The resulting unstained patches reveal the stereotyped spatial pattern of cell division during gastrulation Although the cells that give rise to the amnioserosa have acetylated in their interphase arrays at early gastrulation by germ band elongation these large plastic cells completely lack staining with In contrast differentiated cell types such as neurones which have arrays of stable axonal microtubules stain brightly with the specific antibody

melanogaster maps to a separate locus haywire located at map units in polytene region mutations such as haync2 and B2t alleles could identify genes that encode products that participate in the same functions or that interact in the same structure Consistent with a structural interaction between the hay gene product and beta the genetic interaction between haync2 and B2t requires the presence of the mutant hay gene product a deficiency for the hay region complements the same alleles of B2t that haync2 fails to complement haync2 is a recessive male sterile mutation in a genetic background that is wild type at the B2t locus Homozygous males have defects in meiosis flagellar elongation and nuclear shaping the three major processes in which the beta participates The haync2 allele also has effects outside of spermatogenesis It is a semilethal mutation and homozygous haync2 females have reduced fertility These phenotypes are consistent with a role for the haywire gene product in general

104 3 Abstract A recessive male sterile mutation B2t8 that encodes a stable variant of the beta of Drosophila causes the assembly of aberrant microtubules both in vivo and in vitro The B2t8 mutation appears to cause defects in the formation of interprotofilament bonds In testes from homozygous mutant males the most commonly observed aberrant structures were sheets of protofilaments curved to form an S in cross section rather than a normal closed microtubule These characteristic structures appear in the meiotic spindle in place of axonemes in differentiating spermatids and in cytoplasmic microtubules including those that lie next to the nucleus during nuclear elongation Homozygous mutant males exhibit defects in chromosome movement and cytokinesis during meiosis flagellar elongation and nuclear shaping indicating that the ability to form normal closed microtubules is required for each of these events The presence of the aberrant microtubules in three architecturally different microtubule arrays demonstrates conclusively the multifunctional nature of the beta gene product Although the mutant beta subunit causes assembly of aberrant microtubules in vitro and in homozygous

thermal stability of tyrosyl interactions were observed between scaffolding protein extracted from the procapsid and within the procapsid These differences correspond to different hydrogen bonding

proteins and the genetic control of virus shell assembly Quarterly review of biology KING Fuller 1980 55 4 Abstract Historically a gap has existed between the study of the organization of hereditary information in genes and of the organization of macromolecules in biological structures In this article we describe progress in closing this gap through the genetic and biochemical analysis of the assembly of the icosahedral shells of spherical viruses a class of subcellular structures whose subunit organization is relatively well understood The genes specifying the proteins required for capsid assembly have been identified for many bacterial viruses By using mutants defective in these genes it has been possible to identify intermediates in shell morphogenesis and DNA condensation and to unravel the different levels of the genetic control of macromolecular assembly processes In general a precursor shell or procapsid is first constructed and the DNA is subsequently coiled within it The construction of a closed shell poses as difficult a problem for a virus as for an architect In the bacteriophage P22 of Salmonella typhimurium the construction of the procapsid requires the interaction of about 200 molecules of the scaffolding protein with 420 molecules of the coat protein forming a structure with the scaffolding protein on the inside Once completed procapsids undergo substantial alteration in the course of encapsulating the viral DNA In P22 the initiation of DNA packaging triggers the exit of all of the scaffolding molecules from within the capsid probably through the lattice These released molecules are interacting with newly synthesized coat subunits to form further procapsids Thus the scaffolding protein functions catalytically in capsid assembly All of the DNA phages require a scaffolding protein species for procapsid assembly though their properties vary Purified coat and scaffolding subunits by themselves show little tendency to polymerize and are stable as monomers in solution Upon mixing together under the appropriate conditions however the proteins copolymerize into double shells Their interaction with each other appears to be critical for efficient assembly this interaction probably occurs on the edges of growing shells and not among subunits in solution We have termed this kind of process which we previously described in T4 tail morphogenesis assembly The subunits are synthesized in a nonreactive form and are activated not in solution but upon incorporation into the growing substrate structure A number of further transformations of the capsid subunits occur only within the organized structure and not as free subunits Thus aspects of the genetic information controlling the assembly process are not fully expressed at the level of the properties of protein subunits but become manifest only through interactions with other proteins or at a higher level after completion of the correct organized structure

DNA phages a precursor protein shell empty of DNA is first assembled and then filled with DNA The assembly of the correctly dimensioned precursor shell procapsid of Salmonella bacteriophage P22 requires the interaction of some 420 coat protein subunits with approximately 200 scaffolding protein subunits to form a double shelled particle with the scaffolding protein on the inside In the course of DNA packaging all of the scaffolding protein subunits exit from the procapsid and participate in further rounds of procapsid assembly King and Casjens 1974 Nature To study the mechanism of shell assembly we have purified the coat and scaffolding protein subunits by selective dissociation of isolated procapsids Both proteins can be obtained as soluble subunits in Tris buffer at near neutral pH The coat protein sedimented in sucrose gradients as a roughly spherical monomer while the scaffolding protein sedimented as if it were an elongated monomer When the two proteins were mixed together in M guanidine hydrochloride and dialyzed back to buffer at room temperature procapsids formed which were very similar in morphology sedimentation behavior and protein composition to procapsids formed in vivo Incubation of either protein alone under the same conditions did not yield any large structures We interpret these results to mean that the assembly of the shell involves a switching of both proteins from their nonaggregating to their aggregating forms through their mutual interaction The results are discussed in terms of the general problem of assembly and the control of protein polymerization in morphogenesis View details for Web of Science ID A1980KM03600053 View details for PubMedID 7018607 STUDIES OF VIRUS STRUCTURE BY SPECTROSCOPY INVESTIGATION OF SECONDARY
