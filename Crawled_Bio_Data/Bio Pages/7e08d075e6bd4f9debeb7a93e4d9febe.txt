research focuses on the development and function of glial cells in the vertebrate nervous system Glia are cells with many essential functions ranging from forming the myelin sheath to defending the brain against of our goals is to use genetic approaches in zebrafish to discover new genes with essential functions in the glial cells that form the myelin sheath which allows for rapid axonal conduction in vertebrates Disruption of myelin underlies important human diseases including Multiple Sclerosis and peripheral neuropathies The formation of myelin which involves reciprocal signaling between neurons and glial cells a dramatic morphological transformation of the glial cells and organization of the axon into different specialized domains is fascinating but nonetheless poorly understood In genetic screens we have identified mutations in more than 15 different genes that have specific functions in the development of myelinated axons Among these are a novel coupled receptor that instructs Schwann cells to make myelin in peripheral nerves receptors that control migration of glial cells along growing axons a kinesin motor protein that is essential for mRNA localization and normal membrane compaction in myelinating oligodendrocytes and a transcription factor that regulates the migration of the cells that form myelin in the brain and spinal cord Another goal of our research is to identify new genes that regulate microglia which are specialized macrophages that are dedicated to the immune defense of the brain Microglia also have critical roles in regulating synaptic connectivity and engulfing dead neurons to maintain homeostasis in the brain Microglial dysfunction has been implicated a wide array of disorders including autism and Alzheimer with screens for mutants with abnormal microglia we have identified novel genes regulate microglial development and function Examples include a receptor that suppresses inappropriate inflammation a phosphate exporter that functions specifically in microglia and other tissue macrophages and a regulator of lysosomal action that allows microglia to digest material that they projects provide new insights into glial cell development and function generate new animal models of human disease define pathways that may be disrupted in disease and may provide new avenues toward therapies for diseases of glia

Iyer Bouchard Williams Talbot 2018 47 3 319 Abstract Myelin allows for fast and efficient axonal conduction but much remains to be determined about the mechanisms that regulate myelin formation To investigate the genetic basis of myelination we carried out a genetic screen using zebrafish Here we show that the lysosomal G protein RagA is essential for CNS myelination In mutant oligodendrocytes target genes of the lysosomal transcription factor Tfeb are upregulated consistent with previous evidence that RagA represses Tfeb activity Loss of Tfeb function is sufficient to restore myelination in RagA mutants indicating that hyperactive Tfeb represses myelination Conversely single mutants exhibit ectopic myelin further indicating that Tfeb represses myelination during development In a mouse model of and remyelination TFEB expression is increased in oligodendrocytes but the protein is localized to the cytoplasm and hence inactive especially during remyelination These results define essential regulators of myelination and may advance approaches to therapeutic remyelination View details for PubMedID 30399334 An Receptor Is Required for Microglia Development CELL REPORTS Shiau Monk Joo Talbot 2013 5 5 Abstract Microglia are phagocytic cells that form the basis of the brain immune system They derive from primitive macrophages that migrate into the brain during embryogenesis but the genetic control of microglial development remains elusive Starting with a genetic screen in zebrafish we show that the noncanonical receptor NLR is essential for microglial formation Although most NLRs trigger inflammatory signaling acts cell autonomously in microglia precursor cells to suppress unwarranted inflammation in the absence of overt immune challenge In mutants primitive macrophages initiate a systemic inflammatory response with increased proinflammatory cytokines and actively aggregate instead of migrating into the brain to form microglia requires both its pyrin and NACHT domains and it can bind the inflammasome component protein Our studies suggest that may regulate the inflammasome and other inflammatory pathways Together these results demonstrate that prevents inappropriate macrophage activation thereby allowing normal microglial development View details for DOI View details for Web of Science ID 000328266400017 View details for PubMedID 24316075 View

nerves Schwann cells form the myelin sheath that insulates axons and allows rapid propagation of action potentials Although a number of regulators of Schwann cell development are known the signaling pathways that control myelination are incompletely understood In this study we show that Gpr126 is essential for myelination and other aspects of peripheral nerve development in mammals A mutation in Gpr126 causes a severe congenital hypomyelinating peripheral neuropathy in mice and expression of differentiated Schwann cell markers including Pou3f1 Egr2 myelin protein zero and myelin basic protein is reduced Ultrastructural studies of mice showed that axonal sorting by Schwann cells is delayed Remak bundles Schwann cells associated with small caliber axons are not observed and Schwann cells are ultimately arrested at the promyelinating stage Additionally ectopic perineurial fibroblasts form aberrant fascicles throughout the endoneurium of the mutant sciatic nerve This analysis shows that Gpr126 is required for Schwann cell myelination in mammals and defines new roles for Gpr126 in axonal sorting formation of mature Schwann cells and organization of the perineurium View details for DOI

SCIENCE Monk Naylor Glenn Mercurio Perlin Dominguez Moens Talbot 2009 325 5946 Abstract The myelin sheath allows axons to conduct action potentials rapidly in the vertebrate nervous system Axonal signals activate expression of specific transcription factors including Oct6 and Krox20 that initiate myelination in Schwann cells Elevation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate cAMP can mimic axonal contact in vitro but the mechanisms that regulate cAMP levels in vivo are unknown Using mutational analysis in zebrafish we found that the G receptor Gpr126 is required autonomously in Schwann cells for myelination In gpr126 mutants Schwann cells failed to express oct6 and krox20 and were arrested at the promyelinating stage Elevation of cAMP in gpr126 mutants but not krox20 mutants could restore myelination We propose that Gpr126 drives the differentiation of promyelinating Schwann cells by elevating cAMP levels thereby triggering Oct6 expression and myelination View details for DOI View

Cell reports Shen Sidik Talbot 2016 14 3 Abstract Microglia are resident macrophages of the CNS that are essential for phagocytosis of apoptotic neurons and weak synapses during development We show that RagA and Lamtor4 two components of the complex are essential regulators of lysosomes in microglia In zebrafish lacking RagA function microglia exhibit an expanded lysosomal compartment but they are unable to properly digest apoptotic neuronal debris Previous biochemical studies have placed the complex upstream of mTORC1 activation in response to cellular nutrient availability Nonetheless RagA and mTOR mutant zebrafish have distinct phenotypes indicating that the complex has functions independent of mTOR signaling Our analysis reveals an essential role of the complex in proper lysosome

Carvalho Carvalho Kok Talbot Melki Laing 2015 96 6 Abstract Arthrogryposis multiplex congenita is defined by the presence of contractures across two or more major joints and results from reduced or absent fetal movement Here we present three consanguineous families affected by lethal arthrogryposis multiplex congenita By or targeted exome sequencing it was shown that the probands each harbored a different homozygous mutation one missense one nonsense and one frameshift mutation in GPR126 GPR126 encodes receptor 126 which has been shown to be essential for myelination of axons in the peripheral nervous system in fish and mice A previous study reported that Gpr126 mice have a lethal arthrogryposis phenotype We have shown that the peripheral nerves in affected individuals from one family lack myelin basic protein suggesting that this disease in affected individuals is due to defective myelination of the peripheral axons during fetal development Previous work has suggested that autoproteolytic cleavage is important for activating GPR126 signaling and our biochemical assays indicated that the missense substitution A impairs autoproteolytic cleavage of GPR126 Our data indicate that GPR126 is critical for myelination of peripheral nerves in humans This study adds to the literature implicating defective axoglial function as a key cause of severe arthrogryposis multiplex congenita and suggests that GPR126 mutations should be investigated in individuals affected by this disorder View details for DOI View details for PubMedID 26004201 Glial Cell Development and Function

Adult Macrophages in Zebrafish PloS one Shiau Kaufman Meireles Talbot 2015 10 1 Abstract Interferon regulatory factor 8 Irf8 is critical for mammalian macrophage development and innate immunity but its role in teleost myelopoiesis remains incompletely understood In particular genetic tools to analyze the role of Irf8 in zebrafish macrophage development at larval and adult stages are lacking We generated irf8 null mutants in zebrafish using targeting Our analysis defines different requirements for irf8 at different stages irf8 is required for formation of all macrophages during primitive and transient definitive hematopoiesis but not during definitive hematopoiesis starting at days postfertilization At early stages irf8 mutants have excess neutrophils and excess cell death in myeloid cells Macrophage fates were recovered in irf8 mutants after wildtype irf8 expression in neutrophil and macrophage lineages suggesting that irf8 regulates macrophage specification and survival In juvenile irf8 mutant fish mature macrophages are present but at numbers significantly reduced compared to wildtype indicating an ongoing requirement for irf8 after embryogenesis As development progresses tissue macrophages become apparent in zebrafish irf8 mutants with the possible exception of microglia Our study defines distinct requirement for irf8 in myelopoiesis before and after

GPCR that is essential for the development of diverse organs We found that type IV collagen a major constituent of the basement membrane binds to Gpr126 and activates its signaling function Type IV collagen stimulated the production of cyclic adenosine monophosphate in rodent Schwann cells which require Gpr126 activity to differentiate and in human embryonic kidney HEK 293 cells expressing exogenous Gpr126 Type IV collagen specifically bound to the extracellular region of Gpr126 containing the CUB complement Uegf Bmp1 and pentraxin domains Gpr126 derivatives lacking the entire region were constitutively active suggesting that this region inhibits signaling and that ligand binding relieves this inhibition to stimulate receptor activity A new zebrafish mutation that truncates Gpr126 after the CUB and pentraxin domains disrupted development of peripheral nerves and the inner ear Thus our findings identify type IV collagen as an activating ligand for GPR126 define its mechanism of

cell response to injury Current opinion in neurobiology Glenn Talbot 2013 23 6 Abstract In peripheral nerves Schwann cells form myelin which facilitates the rapid conduction of action potentials along axons in the vertebrate nervous system Myelinating Schwann cells are derived from neural crest progenitors in a process that is regulated by extracellular signals and transcription factors In addition to forming the myelin sheath Schwann cells orchestrate much of the regenerative response that occurs after injury to peripheral nerves In response to injury myelinating Schwann cells dedifferentiate into repair cells that are essential for axonal regeneration and then redifferentiate into myelinating Schwann cells to restore nerve function Although this remarkable plasticity has long been recognized many questions remain unanswered regarding the signaling pathways regulating both myelination and the Schwann cell response to injury View details for DOI View details for PubMedID 23896313 View details for PubMedCentralID PMC3830599 Analysis of Gpr126 function defines distinct mechanisms controlling the initiation and maturation of myelin DEVELOPMENT Glenn Talbot 2013 140 15 Abstract In peripheral nerves Schwann cells form the myelin sheath which allows the efficient propagation of action potentials along axons The transcription factor Krox20 regulates the initiation of myelination in Schwann cells and is also required to maintain mature myelin The adhesion G receptor GPCR Gpr126 is essential for Schwann cells to initiate myelination but previous studies have not addressed the role of Gpr126 signaling in myelin maturation and maintenance Through analysis of Gpr126 in zebrafish we define two distinct mechanisms controlling the initiation and maturation of myelin We show that gpr126 mutant Schwann cells elaborate mature myelin sheaths and maintain krox20 expression for months provided that the early signaling defect is bypassed by transient elevation of cAMP At the onset of myelination Gpr126 and protein kinase A PKA function as a switch that allows Schwann cells to initiate krox20 expression and myelination After myelination is initiated krox20 expression is maintained and myelin maturation proceeds independently of Gpr126 signaling Transgenic analysis indicates that the Krox20 myelinating Schwann cell element MSE becomes active at the onset of myelination and that this activity is dependent on Gpr126 signaling Activity of the MSE declines after initiation suggesting that other elements are responsible for maintaining krox20 expression in mature nerves We also show that elevated cAMP does not initiate myelination in the absence of functional Neuregulin 1 Nrg1 signaling These results indicate that the mechanisms regulating the initiation of myelination are distinct from those mediating the maturation and maintenance of myelin View details for DOI View details for Web of Science ID 000321864900010 View details for PubMedID

liver disease in humans Sec63 is a member of the endoplasmic reticulum ER translocon machinery although it is unclear how mutations in SEC63 lead to liver cyst formation in humans Here we report the identification and characterization of a zebrafish sec63 mutant which was discovered in a screen for mutations that affect the development of myelinated axons Accordingly we show that disruption of sec63 in zebrafish leads to abnormalities in myelinating glia in both the central and peripheral nervous systems In the vertebrate nervous system segments of myelin are separated by the nodes of Ranvier which are unmyelinated regions of axonal membrane containing a high density of sodium channels We show that sec63 mutants have morphologically abnormal and reduced numbers of clusters of sodium channels in the spinal cord and along peripheral nerves Additionally we observed reduced myelination in both the central and peripheral nervous systems as well as swollen ER in myelinating glia Markers of ER stress are upregulated in sec63 mutants Finally we show that sec63 mutants develop liver pathology As in glia the primary defect detectable at 5 dpf is fragmentation and swelling of the ER indicative of accumulation of proteins in the lumen At 8 dpf ER swelling is severe other pathological features include disrupted bile canaliculi altered cytoplasmic matrix and accumulation of large lysosomes Together our analyses of sec63 mutant zebrafish highlight the possible role of ER stress in polycystic liver disease and suggest that these mutants will serve as a model for understanding the pathophysiology of this disease and other abnormalities involving ER stress View details for DOI View details for Web of Science ID 000314865700015 View details for PubMedID 22864019 View details

covalent modification by cholesterol and palmitate Hedgehog Hh signaling proteins are localized predominantly to the plasma membrane of expressing cells Yet Hh proteins are also capable of mobilizing to and eliciting direct responses from distant cells The zebrafish you gene identified genetically 15 years ago was more recently shown to encode a secreted glycoprotein that acts in the Hh signaling pathway by an unknown mechanism We investigated the function of the protein encoded by murine Scube2 an ortholog of you and found that it mediates release in soluble form of the mature and Sonic hedgehog protein signal ShhNp when added to cultured cells or purified membrane microdomains containing ShhNp The efficiency of release of ShhNp is enhanced by the palmitate adduct of ShhNp and by coexpression in cells of mDispatchedA mDispA a protein with a previously defined role in the release of Hh signals The structural determinants of Scube2 required for its activity in cultured cell assays match those required for rescue of you mutant zebrafish embryos and we thus conclude that the role of proteins in Hh signaling in vivo is to facilitate the release and mobilization of Hh

single Schwann cell Tight regulation of Schwann cell movement proliferation and differentiation is essential to ensure that these glial cells properly associate with axons ErbB receptors are required for Schwann cell migration but the operative ligand and its mechanism of action have remained unknown We demonstrate that zebrafish Neuregulin 1 Nrg1 type III which signals through ErbB receptors controls Schwann cell migration in addition to its previously known roles in proliferation and myelination Chimera analyses indicate that ErbB receptors are required in all migrating Schwann cells and that Nrg1 type III is required in neurons for migration Surprisingly expression of the ligand in a few axons is sufficient to induce migration along a chimeric nerve constituted largely of nrg1 type III mutant axons These studies also reveal a mechanism that allows Schwann cells to fasciculate axons regardless of nrg1 type III expression imaging of transgenic embryos demonstrated that misexpression of human NRG1 type III results in ectopic Schwann cell migration allowing them to aberrantly enter the central nervous system These results demonstrate that Nrg1 type III is an essential

2011 59 7 Abstract In the peripheral nervous system Schwann cells make myelin a specialized sheath that is essential for rapid axonal conduction of action potentials Immature Schwann cells initially interact with many axons but through a process termed radial sorting eventually interact with one segment of a single axon as promyelinating Schwann cells Previous studies have identified genes that are required for Schwann cell process extension and proliferation during radial sorting Previous analyses also show that ErbB signaling is required for Schwann cell proliferation myelination radial sorting and the proper formation of unmyelinated Remak bundles Because ErbB signaling and Schwann cell proliferation are both required during radial sorting we sought to determine if the primary function of ErbB signaling in this process is to regulate Schwann cell proliferation or if ErbB signaling also controls other aspects of radial sorting To address this question we applied small molecule inhibitors in vivo in zebrafish to independently block ErbB signaling and proliferation Ultrastructural analysis of treated animals revealed that both ErbB signaling and Schwann cell proliferation are required for radial sorting in vivo ErbB signaling however is required for Schwann cell process extension while Schwann cell proliferation is not These results provide in vivo evidence that ErbB signaling plays a direct role in process extension during radial sorting in addition to its role in regulating Schwann cell proliferation View details for DOI View details for Web

its targets DEVELOPMENT Raphael Perlin Talbot 2010 137 21 Abstract Although much is known about the initial construction of the peripheral nervous system PNS less well understood are the processes that maintain the position and connections of nerves during postembryonic growth Here we show that the posterior lateral line nerve in zebrafish initially grows in the epidermis and then rapidly transitions across the epidermal basement membrane into the subepidermal space Our experiments indicate that Schwann cells which myelinate axons in the PNS are required to reposition the nerve In mutants lacking Schwann cells the nerve is mislocalized and the axons remain in the epidermis Transplanting Schwann cells into these mutants rescues the position of the nerve Analysis of chimeric embryos suggests that the process of nerve relocalization involves two discrete steps the degradation and recreation of the epidermal basement membrane Although the outgrowth of axons is normal in mutants lacking Schwann cells the nerve becomes severely disorganized at later stages In embryos exclusion of the nerve from the epidermis isolates axons from migration of their targets sensory neuromasts within the epidermis Without Schwann cells axons remain within the epidermis and are dragged along with the migrating neuromasts Our analysis of the posterior lateral line system defines a new process in which Schwann cells relocate a nerve beneath the epidermal basement membrane to insulate axons from the postembryonic remodeling of their targets View details for DOI View details for

action potentials in myelinated axons Sodium channels localize to the AIS through an mechanism driven by ankyrin G while clustering at the nodes requires cues from myelinating glia that interact with axonal neurofascin186 Sherman et 2005 Dzhashiashvili et 2007 Yang et 2007 Here we report that in zebrafish mutants lacking Schwann cells in peripheral nerves erbb2 erbb3 and axons form numerous aberrant sodium channel clusters throughout their length Morpholino knockdown of ankyrin G but not neurofascin reduces the number of sodium channel clusters in Schwann mutants suggesting that these aberrant clusters form by an mechanism We also find that gpr126 mutants in which Schwann cells are arrested at the promyelinating stage Monk et 2009 are deficient in the clustering of neurofascin at the nodes of Ranvier When Schwann cell migration in gpr126 mutants is blocked there is an increase in the number of neurofascin clusters in peripheral axons Our results suggest that Schwann cells

myelin proteins in kif1b mutant oligodendrocyte cell bodies These observations suggest that oligodendrocytes localize certain mRNA molecules namely those encoding small basic proteins such as MBP to prevent aberrant effects of these proteins elsewhere in the cell We also find that Kif1b is required for outgrowth of some of the longest axons in the peripheral and central nervous systems Our data

development shows that the speed of early axonal outgrowth is reduced in both the peripheral and central nervous systems in kbp mutants Ultrastructural studies reveal that kbp mutants have disruption to axonal microtubules during outgrowth These results together suggest that kbp is an important regulator of the microtubule dynamics that drive the forward propulsion of axons At later stages we observe that many affected axons degenerate Ultrastructural analyses at these stages demonstrate mislocalization of axonal mitochondria and a reduction in axonal number in the peripheral central and enteric nervous systems We propose that kbp is an important regulator of axonal development and that axonal cytoskeletal defects underlie the nervous system defects in GSS View details for DOI View

Imai Draper Moens Talbot 2007 310 1 Abstract Bone morphogenetic proteins BMPs are key mediators of dorsoventral patterning in vertebrates and are required for the induction of ventral fates in fish and frogs A widely accepted model of dorsoventral patterning postulates that a morphogenetic BMP activity gradient patterns cell fates along the dorsoventral axis Recent work in zebrafish suggests that the role of BMP signaling changes over time with BMPs required for global dorsoventral patterning during early gastrulation and for tail patterning during late gastrulation and early somitogenesis Key questions remain about the late phase including which BMP ligands are required and how the functions of BMPs differ during the early and late gastrula stages In a screen for dominant enhancers of mutations in the homeobox genes vox and vent which function in parallel to bmp signaling we identified an insertion mutation in bmp4 We then performed a reverse genetic screen to isolate a null allele of bmp4 We report the characterization of these two alleles and demonstrate that BMP4 is required during the later phase of BMP signaling for the specification of ventroposterior cell fates Our results indicate that different bmp genes are essential at different stages In addition we present genetic evidence supporting a role for a morphogenetic BMP gradient in establishing mesodermal fates during the later phase of BMP signaling View details for DOI View details for Web of Science ID 000250080000007 View details for PubMedID 17727832 View details for PubMedCentralID

second SDF1 receptor CXCR7 is required only in the trailing cells of the primordium and they explore how these two receptors orchestrate migration of the primordium CXCR4b and CXCR7 are expressed in complementary domains possibly through mutual repression in which each receptor inhibits expression of the other These studies illustrate how the entire primordium can respond to a single signal yet generate cell responses by using different receptors View details for PubMedID 17712137 Putting the glue in glia Necls mediate Schwann adhesion JOURNAL OF CELL BIOLOGY Perlin Talbot 2007 178 5

Ultrastructural studies show that myelin forms in the posterior lateral line nerve and in the ventral spinal cord in mutants and that the node is abnormally long these findings indicate that is required for the assembly of a mature node of the correct length We find that is enriched in nodes and paranodes at early stages and that the nodal expression diminishes as nodes mature Our results

saltatory conduction Specialized glial cells termed Schwann cells in the PNS and oligodendrocytes in the CNS wrap axons to form myelin a compacted multilayered sheath comprising specific proteins and lipids Disruption of myelinated axons causes human diseases including multiple sclerosis and peripheral neuropathies Despite the progress in identifying human disease genes and other mutations disrupting glial development and myelination many important unanswered questions remain about the mechanisms that coordinate the development of myelinated axons To address these questions we began a genetic dissection of myelination in zebrafish Here we report a genetic screen that identified 13 mutations which define 10 genes disrupting the development of myelinated axons We present the initial characterization of seven of these mutations defining six different genes along with additional characterization of mutations that we have described previously The different mutations affect the PNS the CNS or both and phenotypic analyses indicate that the genes affect a wide range of steps in glial development from fate specification through terminal differentiation The analysis of these mutations will advance our understanding of myelination and the mutants will serve as models of human diseases of myelin View details for DOI View details for Web of Science ID 000241071100011 View

rapid conduction of action potentials in the vertebrate nervous system Of particular importance are the nodes of Ranvier sites of sodium channel clustering that allow action potentials to be propagated along myelinated axons by saltatory conduction Despite their critical role in the function of myelinated axons little is known about the mechanisms that organize the nodes of with a forward genetic screen in zebrafish we have identified an essential requirement for nsf sensitive factor in the organization of myelinated axons Previous work has shown that NSF is essential for membrane fusion in eukaryotes and has a critical role in vesicle fusion at chemical synapses Zebrafish nsf mutants are paralyzed and have impaired response to light reflecting disrupted nsf function in synaptic transmission and neural activity In addition nsf mutants exhibit defects in Myelin basic protein expression and in localization of sodium channel proteins at nodes of Ranvier Analysis of chimeric larvae indicates that nsf functions autonomously in neurons such that sodium channel clusters are evident in neurons transplanted into the nsf mutant hosts Through pharmacological analyses we show that neural activity and function of chemical synapses are not required for sodium channel clustering and myelination in the larval nervous nsf mutants provide a novel vertebrate system to investigate Nsf function in vivo Our results reveal a previously unknown role for nsf independent of its function in synaptic vesicle fusion in the formation of the nodes of Ranvier in the vertebrate

RESEARCH Woods Wilson Friedlander Chang Reyes Nix Kelly Chu Postlethwait Talbot 2005 15 9 Abstract Genetic screens in zebrafish Danio rerio have identified mutations that define the roles of hundreds of essential vertebrate genes Genetic maps can link mutant phenotype with gene sequence by providing candidate genes for mutations and polymorphic genetic markers useful in positional cloning projects Here we report a zebrafish genetic map comprising 4073 polymorphic markers with more than twice the number of coding sequences localized in previously reported zebrafish genetic maps We use this map in comparative studies to identify numerous regions of synteny conserved among the genomes of zebrafish Tetraodon and human In addition we use our map to analyze gene duplication in the zebrafish and Tetraodon genomes Current evidence suggests that a duplication occurred in the teleost lineage after it split from the tetrapod lineage and that only a subset of the duplicates have been retained in modern teleost genomes It has been proposed that differential retention of duplicate genes may have facilitated the isolation of nascent species formed during the vast radiation of teleosts We find that different duplicated genes have been retained in zebrafish and Tetraodon although similar numbers of duplicates remain in both genomes Finally we use comparative mapping data to address the proposal that the common ancestor of vertebrates had a genome consisting of 12 chromosomes In a comparison between the genomes of zebrafish Tetraodon and human our analysis delineates the gene content for 11 of these 12 proposed ancestral chromosomes View details for DOI View details for PubMedID 16109975 erbb3 and erbb2 are essential for Schwann cell migration and myelination in zebrafish CURRENT BIOLOGY Lyons Pogoda Voas Woods Diamond Nix Arana Jacobs Talbot 2005 15 6 Abstract Myelin is critical for efficient axonal conduction in the vertebrate nervous system Neuregulin Nrg ligands and their ErbB receptors are required for the development of Schwann cells the glial cells that form myelin in the peripheral nervous system Previous studies have not determined whether signaling is essential in vivo for Schwann cell fate specification proliferation survival migration or the onset of genetic screens for mutants with disruptions in myelinated nerves we identified mutations in erbb3 and erbb2 which together encode a heteromeric tyrosine kinase receptor for Neuregulin ligands Phenotypic analysis shows that both genes are essential for development of Schwann cells studies and analysis reveal that Schwann cell proliferation and migration but not survival are disrupted in erbb3 mutants We show that Schwann cells can migrate in the absence of DNA replication This uncoupling of proliferation and migration indicates that erbb gene function is required independently for these two processes Pharmacological inhibition of ErbB signaling at different stages reveals a continuing requirement for ErbB function during migration and also provides evidence that ErbB signaling is required after migration for proliferation and the terminal differentiation of myelinating Schwann results provide in vivo evidence that signaling is essential for directed Schwann cell migration and demonstrate that this pathway is also required for the onset of myelination in postmigratory

of cancer genetic screens in zebrafish have identified a group of mutations termed mutations that share common defects in somite shape and in most cases disrupt Hedgehog signaling These mutant embryos exhibit somites characteristic of defects in slow muscle development In addition Hedgehog pathway mutations disrupt spinal cord patterning We report the positional cloning of you one of the original mutations and show that it is required for Hedgehog signaling in the development of slow muscle and in the specification of ventral fates in the spinal cord The you gene encodes a novel protein with conserved EGF and CUB domains and a secretory pathway signal sequence Epistasis experiments support an extracellular role for You upstream of the Hedgehog response mechanism Analysis of chimeras

Molecular genetics of axis formation in zebrafish ANNUAL REVIEW OF GENETICS Schier Talbot 2005 39 Abstract The basic vertebrate body plan of the zebrafish embryo is established in the first 10 hours

cells During the past 10 years a combination of genetic embryological and molecular analyses has provided detailed insights into the mechanisms underlying this process Maternal determinants control the expression of transcription factors and the location of signaling centers that pattern the blastula and gastrula Bmp Nodal FGF canonical Wnt and retinoic acid signals generate positional information that leads to the restricted expression of transcription factors that control cell type specification Noncanonical Wnt signaling is required for the morphogenetic movements during

of the TGFbeta superfamily of secreted factors induce formation of mesoderm and endoderm in vertebrate embryos We have examined the possible dorsoventral and patterning roles for Nodal signals by using mutations in two zebrafish genes squint and cyclops to manipulate genetically the levels and timing of Nodal activity squint mutants lack dorsal mesendodermal gene expression at the late blastula stage and fate mapping and gene expression studies in sqt cyc and sqt cyc mutants show that some dorsal marginal cells inappropriately form hindbrain and spinal cord instead of dorsal mesendodermal derivatives The effects on ventrolateral mesendoderm are less severe although the endoderm is reduced and muscle precursors are located nearer to the margin than in wild type Our results support a role for Nodal signals in patterning the mesendoderm along the axis and indicate that dorsal and ventrolateral mesoderm require different levels of squint and cyclops function Dorsal marginal cells were not transformed toward more lateral fates in either sqt cyc or sqt cyc embryos arguing against a role for the graded action of Nodal signals in dorsoventral patterning of the mesendoderm Differential regulation of the cyclops gene in these cells contributes to the different requirements for gene function in these cells Dorsal expression of cyclops requires autoregulation whereas other factors induce cyclops expression in ventrolateral cells In addition the differential timing of dorsal mesendoderm induction in squint and cyclops mutants suggests that dorsal marginal

and regulate key events in vertebrate embryogenesis including mesoderm formation establishment of asymmetry and neural patterning Nodal ligands are thought to act with protein to activate activin type I and II or related receptors which phosphorylate Smad2 and trigger nuclear translocation of a complex The transcription factor forkhead activin signal acts as a for Smad2 Xenopus is thought to function as a transcriptional effector of Nodal signals during mesoderm formation 17 but no mutations in the gene have been identified We report the identification of the zebrafish fast1 gene and show that it is disrupted in schmalspur sur mutants which have defects in the development of dorsal midline cell types and establishment of asymmetry We find that prechordal plate and notochord are strongly reduced in sur mutants whereas other mesendodermal structures are present a less severe phenotype than that caused by complete loss of Nodal signaling These results show that fast1 is required for development of dorsal axial structures and asymmetry and suggest that Nodal signals act through and independent pathways View details for PubMedID 10996072 Bozozok and squint act in parallel to specify dorsal mesoderm and anterior neuroectoderm in zebrafish DEVELOPMENT Sirotkin Dougan Schier Talbot 2000 127 12 Abstract In vertebrate embryos maternal beta protein activates the expression of zygotic genes that establish the dorsal axial structures Among the zygotically acting genes with key roles in the specification of dorsal axial structures are the homeobox gene bozozok boz and the beta family gene squint sqt Both genes are expressed in the dorsal yolk syncytial layer a source of dorsal mesoderm inducing signals and mutational analysis has indicated that boz and sqt are required for dorsal mesoderm development Here we examine the regulatory interactions among boz sqt and a second gene cyclops cyc Three lines of evidence indicate that boz and sqt act in parallel to specify dorsal mesoderm and anterior neuroectoderm First boz requires sqt function to induce high levels of ectopic dorsal mesoderm consistent with sqt acting either downstream or in parallel to boz Second sqt mRNA is expressed in blastula stage boz mutants indicating that boz is not essential for activation of sqt transcription and conversely boz mRNA is expressed in blastula stage sqt mutants Third boz sqt double mutants have a much more severe phenotype than boz and sqt single mutants Double mutants consistently lack the anterior neural tube and axial mesoderm and ventral fates are markedly expanded Expression of chordin and noggin1 is greatly reduced in boz sqt mutants indicating that the boz and sqt pathways have overlapping roles in activating secreted BMP antagonists In striking contrast to boz sqt double mutants anterior neural fates are specified in boz sqt cyc triple mutants This indicates that cyc represses anterior neural development and that boz and sqt counteract this repressive function Our results support a model in which boz and sqt act in parallel to induce dorsalizing and to counteract the repressive function of cyc in neural patterning View

mutations induced by treatment of spermatogonial premeiotic cells with the chemical mutagen ENU Treatment of postmeiotic gametes with ENU induces mutations at a higher rate than premeiotic regimens suggesting that postmeiotic mutagenesis protocols could be useful in some screening strategies Whereas there is extensive evidence that ENU induces point mutations in premeiotic cells the range of mutations induced in postmeiotic zebrafish germ cells has been less thoroughly characterized Here we report the identification and analysis of five mutations induced by postmeiotic ENU treatment One mutation snh st1 is a translocation involving linkage group LG 11 and LG 14 The other four mutations oep st2 kny st3 Df LG 13 st4 and cyc st5 are deletions ranging in size from less than 3 cM to greater than 20 cM These results show that germ cell stage is an important determinant of the type of mutations induced The induction of chromosomal rearrangements may account for the elevated

isolated mutations in hundreds of genes essential for vertebrate development physiology and behavior We have constructed a genetic linkage map that will facilitate the identification of candidate genes for these mutations and allow comparisons among the genomes of zebrafish and other vertebrates On this map we have localized 771 zebrafish genes and expressed sequence tags ESTs by scoring conformational polymorphisms SSCPs in a meiotic mapping panel Of these sequences 642 represent previously unmapped genes and ESTs The mapping panel was comprised of 42 homozygous diploid individuals produced by heat shock treatment of haploid embryos at the stage HS diploids This doubled haploid strategy combines the advantages of mapping in haploid and standard diploid systems because heat shock diploid individuals have only one allele at each locus and can survive to adulthood enabling a relatively large quantity of genomic DNA to be prepared from each individual in the mapping panel To integrate this map with others we also scored 593 previously mapped length polymorphisms SSLPs in the mapping panel This map will accelerate the molecular analysis of zebrafish mutations and

region of dorsal mesoderm which is termed the organizer pattern the body axis by specifying the fates of neighbouring cells The organizer is itself induced by earlier signals Although members of the transforming growth and Wnt families have been implicated in the formation of the organizer no endogenous signalling molecule is known to be required for this process Here we report that the zebrafish squint sqt and cyclops cyc genes have essential although partly redundant functions in organizer development and also in the formation of mesoderm and endoderm We show that the sqt gene encodes a member of the superfamily that is related to mouse nodal cyc encodes another proteins which is consistent with our genetic evidence that sqt and cyc have overlapping functions The sqt gene is expressed in a dorsal region of the blastula that includes the extraembryonic yolk syncytial layer YSL The YSL has been implicated as a source of signals that induce organizer development and mesendoderm formation Misexpression of sqt RNA within the embryo or specifically in the YSL induces expanded or ectopic dorsal mesoderm These results establish an essential role for signals in
