DOC Current Research and Scholarly Interests Design clinical trials to evaluate new treatments for bladder pain syndrome Clinical Trials Naltrexone for Bladder Pain Syndrome Not Recruiting Interstitial Pain Syndrome is a constellation of symptoms of pelvic discomfort that includes both pain as well as urinary frequency urgency and nocturia in the absence of an identifiable etiology that affects likely more than million patients in the United States There is a significant overlap in patients with and those with fibromyalgia and chronic pelvic pain syndrome naltrexone LDN has been shown to be effective for the treatment of chronic pain conditions The primary aim of this study is to evaluate if LDN improves pain scores and lower urinary tract symptoms in patients with A

histopathology natural history epidemiology prognosis and treatment Cystoscopy is the method of choice to identify Hunner lesions histopathology the method to confirm it You can not distinguish between main forms of BPS by means of symptoms physical examination or laboratory tests Epidemiologic data are incomplete HLD seems relatively uncommon although more frequent in older patients than No indication has been presented of BPS and HLD as a continuum of conditions one developing into the A paradigm shift in the understanding of is urgent A highly topical issue is to separate HLD and BPS treatment results and prognoses differ substantially Since historically IC was tantamount to Hunner lesions and interstitial inflammation in the bladder wall still a valid definition the term IC

of the Japanese Urological Association Akiyama Luo Hanno Maeda Homma Y 2020 Abstract Interstitial pain syndrome is a debilitating condition of unknown etiology characterized by persistent pelvic pain with lower urinary tract symptoms and comprises a wide variety of potentially clinically useful phenotypes with different possible etiologies Current clinicopathological and genomic evidence suggests that interstitial pain syndrome should be categorized by the presence or absence of Hunner lesions rather than by clinical phenotyping based on symptomatology The Hunner lesion subtype is a distinct inflammatory disease with proven bladder etiology characterized by epithelial denudation and enhanced immune responses frequently accompanied by clonal expansion of infiltrating B cells with potential engagement of infection Meanwhile the lesion subtype is a disorder with little evidence of bladder etiology It is potentially associated with urothelial malfunction and neurophysiological dysfunction and frequently presents with somatic psychological symptoms that commonly result in central nervous sensitization Animal models of autoimmune cystitis and neurogenic sensitization might serve as disease models for the Hunner lesion and lesion subtypes respectively Here we revisit the taxonomy of interstitial pain syndrome according to current research and discuss its potential pathophysiology and representative animal models Categorization of interstitial pain syndrome based on cystoscopy is mandatory to design optimized treatment and research strategies for each subtype A tailored approach that specifically targets the characteristic inflammation and epithelial denudation for the Hunner lesion subtype or the urothelial malfunction nervous system and psychosocial problems for the lesion subtype is essential for better clinical management and research progress in this complex condition View details for DOI View details for PubMedID 32246572 LEGENDS IN UROLOGY CANADIAN

Network Study Grp 2019 317 2 Abstract factor CRF regulates stress responses and aberrant CRF signals are associated with depressive disorders Crf expression is responsive to arachidonic acid AA where CRF is released from the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus PVN to initiate the axis culminating in glucocorticoid stress hormone release Despite this biological and clinical significance Crf regulation is unclear Here we report that acyloxyacyl hydrolase encoded by Aoah is expressed in the PVN and Aoah regulates Crf through the aryl hydrocarbon receptor AhR We previously showed that mice mimicked interstitial pain syndrome a condition frequently associated with comorbid anxiety and depression With the use of feeding and sucrose preference assays to quantify rodent correlates of mice exhibited depressive behaviors mice also had increased CNS AA increased Crf expression in the PVN and elevated serum corticosterone consistent with dysfunction of the axis The human Crf promoter has putative binding sites for AhR and peroxisome receptor PPARγ PPARγ did not affect Crf expression in vitro and conditional Pparγ knockout did not alter the depressive phenotype despite previous studies implicating PPARγ as a therapeutic target for depression In contrast Crf induction was mediated by AhR binding sites in vitro and increased by AhR overexpression Furthermore conditional Ahr knockout rescued the depressive phenotype of mice Finally an AhR antagonist rescued the depressive phenotype Together our results demonstrate that Aoah is a novel genetic regulator of Crf mediated through AhR and AhR is a therapeutic target for depression View details for DOI View details for Web of Science ID 000481616900008 View details for PubMedID 31017816 Targeting the SHIP1 Pathway Fails to Show

Japanese Urological Association Akiyama Hanno 2019 26 Suppl 1 Abstract Interstitial pain syndrome is a chronic potentially debilitating condition characterized by pain perceived to be related to the bladder in conjunction with lower urinary tract symptoms and includes a wide variety of clinical phenotypes with diverse etiologies Currently the only clinically relevant proven phenotype of interstitial pain syndrome is the Hunner lesion Whether the presence of Hunner lesions is a hallmark of a distinct disease cohort or a potentially transient feature of lesion phenotype has been debated but remains controversial There are few documented examples of a patient converting between the two forms Growing clinical and basic evidence supports eliminating the Hunner lesion phenotype from the bladder pain syndrome umbrella and considering it a distinct disease The Hunner lesion phenotype is characterized by distinct bladder histology including subepithelial chronic inflammatory changes and epithelial denudation and specific clinical characteristics older onset age severe symptoms reduced bladder capacity and favorable response to the therapies To define the Hunner lesion phenotype it is necessary to develop an atlas of standardized images of cystoscopic and if possible pathological appearances of Hunner lesions A true potential and clinically relevant phenotype of interstitial pain syndrome may be patients with symptoms characterized by the affect dysregulation and somatic symptoms and a greater bladder capacity in absence of Hunner lesions In the present workshop we concluded that the Hunner lesion is a valid phenotype and can reasonably be considered a disease in its own right Assessment of bladder capacity and the extent of symptoms bladder beyond or bladder centric may help phenotyping of interstitial pain syndrome Proper phenotyping is essential for the diagnosis and treatment of interstitial pain syndrome and for facilitating research View

Abstract Recent data suggest the urinary tract hosts a microbial community of varying composition even in the absence of infection methodologies such as sequencing of conserved ribosomal DNA sequences provide an expansive look at these communities identifying both common commensals and fastidious organisms A fundamental challenge has been the isolation of DNA representative of the entire resident microbial community including evaluated multiple modifications of DNA extraction procedures using standardized male and female urine samples comparing resulting overall fungal and bacterial DNA yields by quantitative PCR After identifying protocol modifications that increased DNA yields digestion bead beating cycles proteinase K treatment and carrier DNA use all modifications were combined for systematic confirmation of optimal protocol conditions This optimized protocol was tested against commercially available methodologies to compare overall and microbial DNA yields community representation and diversity by sequencing NGS and DNA yields from standardized urine samples demonstrated that microbial abundances differed significantly among the eight methods used Methodologies that included multiple disruption steps including enzymatic mechanical and thermal disruption and proteinase digestion particularly in combination with small volume processing and pooling steps provided more comprehensive representation of the range of bacterial and fungal species Concentration of larger volume urine specimens at low speed centrifugation proved highly effective increasing resulting DNA levels and providing greater microbial representation and in the methodology of urine storage preparation and DNA processing improve microbial community profiling using sequencing methods Our optimized protocol for DNA extraction from urine samples provided improved fungal community representation Use of this technique resulted in equivalent representation of the bacterial populations as well making this a useful technique for the concurrent evaluation of bacterial and fungal populations by NGS View details for DOI View details for Web of Science ID 000465519100004 View

well as positive controls meeting the associated syndromes NUAS criteria for one or more of the target conditions of Fibromyalgia FM Chronic Fatigue Syndrome CFS or Irritable Bowel Syndrome IBS were also evaluated Additional complementary studies addressing diverse hypotheses are integrated into the EP Study to provide a systemic characterization of study participants including biomarker discovery studies of infectious agents quantitative sensory testing and structural and resting state neuroimaging and functional neurobiology studies A highly novel effort to develop and assess clinically relevant animal models of UCPPS was also undertaken to allow improved translation between clinical and mechanistic studies Recruitment into the central study occurred at six Discovery Sites in the United States resulting in a total of enrolled participants exceeding the original targets The biospecimen collection rate at baseline visits reached nearly 100 and 279 participants underwent common neuroimaging through a standardized protocol An extended study for 161 of the UCPPS participants is MAPP Research Network represents a novel comprehensive approach to the study of UCPPS as well as other concomitant NUAS Findings are expected to provide significant advances in understanding UCPPS pathophysiology that will ultimately inform future clinical trials and lead to improvements in

Foster Hanno Nickel Payne Mayer Burks Yang Chai Kreder Peters Lukacz FitzGerald Cen Landis Propert Yang Kusek Nyberg 2010 183 5 Abstract Amitriptyline is frequently used to treat patients with interstitial bladder syndrome The evidence to support this practice is derived mainly from a small single site clinical trial and case conducted a multicenter randomized placebo controlled clinical trial of amitriptyline in subjects with interstitial bladder syndrome who were naïve to therapy Study participants in both treatment arms received a standardized education and behavioral modification program The drug dose was increased during a period from 10 up to 75 mg once daily The primary outcome was a patient reported global response assessment of symptom improvement evaluated after 12 weeks of total of 271 subjects were randomized and 231 85 provided a global response assessment at 12 weeks of followup Study participants were primarily women 83 and white 74 with a median age of 38 years In an intent to treat analysis 271 the rate of response of subjects reporting moderate or marked improvement from baseline in the amitriptyline and placebo groups was 55 and 45 respectively p Of the subgroup of subjects 207 who achieved a drug dose of at least 50 mg a significantly higher response rate was observed in the amitriptyline group 66 compared to placebo 47 p all randomized subjects were considered amitriptyline plus an education and behavioral modification program did not significantly improve symptoms in treatment naïve patients with interstitial bladder syndrome However amitriptyline may be beneficial in persons who can achieve a daily dose of 50 mg or greater although this subgroup comparison was not specified in advance View details for DOI View details for Web of

interstitial cystitis JOURNAL OF UROLOGY Nickel Tripp Teal Propert Burks Foster Hanno Mayer Payne Peters Kusek Nyberg 2007 177 5 Abstract Interstitial cystitis significantly negatively impacts quality of life The demographic and clinical factors associated with decreased quality of life in these patients have not been well with interstitial cystitis enrolled in a clinical trial of intravesical bacillus were studied Demographic data and responses to questionnaires were evaluated at baseline including the Interstitial Cystitis Symptom Index and Problem Index University of Wisconsin Interstitial Cystitis Inventory Medical Outcomes Study sexual functioning scale and the physical composite and mental composite scales of the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form Health Status Survey Three composite indexes were constructed from the Interstitial Cystitis Symptom Index Interstitial Cystitis Problem Index Likert scales and voiding diary to document the severity frequency and bother of pain urinary urgency and frequency frequency composite index Linear and multivariate regression models were used to examine predictors of the physical composite and mental composite scales of the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form Health Status Survey Medical Outcomes Study sexual functioning scale data were available for 163 of the 217 women in the composite scale median 36 and mental composite scale median 42 were lower than the standard population value of 50 Multivariate models showed that employment pain composite index and Medical Outcomes Study sexual functioning scale all p predicted physical composite scale while only Medical Outcomes Study sexual functioning scale p remained a strong predictor of mental composite functioning employment and pain issues predict mental and physical quality of life In particular this study identifies sexual functioning as a primary predictor of mental quality of life in women with interstitial cystitis It is suggested that sexual functioning may be a salient therapeutic target in the multifaceted treatment of patients with interstitial cystitis View details for DOI View details for Web of Science ID 000245764900066 View

Diokno Hanno Landis Madigan Messing Nickel Sant Warren WEIN Kusek Nyberg Foster 2005 173 4 Abstract We compared intravesical bacillus BCG to placebo instillations in patients with treatment refractory interstitial cystitis IC who met the National Institutes of Institute for Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases criteria for IC and reported at least moderate pain and frequency for a minimum of 6 months before study entry were randomized to 6 weekly intravesical instillations of either BCG or placebo and then followed for a total of 34 weeks The primary outcome was a patient reported global response assessment at week 34 supplemented with medications for IC during weeks 31 to 34 Secondary outcomes included a voiding diary pain urgency validated IC symptom indexes and adverse events The target sample size was 260 participants designed to detect a difference in response rates between placebo and BCG of 30 and 50 total of 265 participants were randomized and 17 6 patients withdrew from study The response rates for the primary outcome were 12 for placebo and 21 for BCG p Small improvements were observed for all secondary outcomes some more so with BCG but these differences were of borderline statistical significance Although a large number of adverse events were reported in the BCG arm there was no statistically significant difference between the treatment arms in overall adverse event the BCG safety profile was acceptable the response rate for the primary outcome was low Effective medical treatment for patients with moderate to severe interstitial cystitis remains
