clinics of North America Cahan Mittal Shah 2020 67 4 Abstract Pediatric practice increasingly involves providing care for children with medical complexity Telehealth offers a strategy for providers and health care systems to improve care for these patients and their families However lack of awareness related to the unintended negative consequences of telehealth on vulnerable populations coupled with failure to intentional design best practices for telehealth initiatives implies that these novel technologies may worsen health disparities in the long run This article reviews the positive and negative implications of telehealth In addition to achieve optimal implementation of telehealth it discusses 10 considerations to promote optimal care of children using these technologies View details

promote health and decrease To evaluate impacts of a social needs screening and navigation program for adult predicted high utilizers on total medical visit A prospective study using an approach Stratified analyses assessed intervention effects among three status patients in areas in areas and with Medicaid Predicted high predicted to be in the highest 1 for total utilization in a large integrated health A telephonic social needs screening and navigation MEASURES Primary analyses compared total visit count utilization including outpatient emergency department ED and inpatient utilization between the intervention and control groups at both and facilities Prevalence of social needs among sample patients and their connection rates to social needs resources are also RESULTS The study included patients 7107 intervention control Most 53 patients screened reported social needs but only a minority 10 of those with a need were able to connect with resources to address these needs Primary analysis found total utilization visits decreased 95 CI in the intervention group Stratified analyses showed decreases in total utilization for all status subgroups receiving the intervention compared with controls 95 CI in the area group p in the area group and p in the Medicaid Social needs navigation programs for patients may have modest effects on utilization for the population overall However significant decreases in utilization were found among status patients more likely to experience social needs View details for DOI View details for PubMedID 31228054 Segmentation of Adults in an Integrated Healthcare System Based on Empirical Clustering of Acute and Chronic Conditions JOURNAL OF GENERAL INTERNAL MEDICINE Davis Shen Shah Glenn B Ponce Telesca Gould Needleman J 2018 33 12 Abstract patients are a frequent focus of improvement projects based on primary care and other settings Efforts to characterize patients are needed to inform care planning but such efforts often rely on a priori assumptions masking underlying complexities of a heterogenous define recognizable subgroups of patients among adults based on clinical conditions and describe their survival and future observational cohort a large integrated delivery system with million adult members we selected the top 1 of continuously enrolled adults with respect to total healthcare expenditures during used latent class analysis to identify clusters of alike patients based on 53 hierarchical condition categories Prognosis as measured by healthcare spending and survival was assessed through 2014 for the resulting classes of adults seven clinically distinctive subgroups of patients emerged Classes included renal disease 12 of population cardiopulmonary conditions 17 diabetes with multiple comorbidities 8 acute illness superimposed on chronic conditions 11 conditions requiring highly specialized care 14 neurologic and catastrophic conditions 5 and patients with few comorbidities the largest class 33 Over 4 years of 6566 31 patients died and survival in the classes ranged from 43 to 88 Spending regressed to the mean in all classes except the ESRD and diabetes with multiple comorbidities characterization of adults yielded clinically intuitive classes that were associated with survival and reflected markedly different healthcare needs Relatively few patients remain persistently high cost over 4 years Our results suggest that patients while not a monolithic group can be segmented into few subgroups These subgroups may be the focus of future work to understand appropriateness of care and design interventions accordingly View details for PubMedID 30182326 View details for PubMedCentralID PMC6258619 Putting the Health of Communities and Populations

Regulatory Framework for Ambulatory Care Services in New York MILBANK QUARTERLY Chokshi Rugge Shah 2014 92 4 Abstract Policy Points The landscape of ambulatory care services in the United States is rapidly changing on account of payment reform primary care transformation and the rise of convenient care options such as retail clinics New York State has undertaken a redesign of regulatory policy for ambulatory care rooted in the Triple Aim better health care lower costs a particular emphasis on continuity of care for patients Key tenets of the regulatory approach include defining and tracking the taxonomy of ambulatory care services as well as ensuring that convenient care options do not erode continuity of care for hospitals remain important centers of gravity in the health system services are increasingly being delivered through ambulatory care This shift to ambulatory care is giving rise to new delivery structures such as retail clinics and urgent care centers as well as reinventing existing ambulatory care capacity as seen with the medical home model and the movement toward care To protect the public interests oversight of ambulatory care services must keep pace with these rapid changes With this purpose in January 2013 the New York Public Health and Health Planning Council undertook a redesign of the regulatory framework for the state ambulatory care services This article describes the principles undergirding the framework as well as the regulatory recommendations explored and analyzed the regulation of ambulatory care services in New York in accordance with the available gray and literature and legislative documents The deliberations of the Public Health and Health Planning Council informed our vision of ambulatory care should be rooted in the Triple Aim better health care lower costs with a particular emphasis on continuity of care for patients There is a pressing need to better define the taxonomy of ambulatory care services From the state government perspective this clarification requires better reporting from new health care entities eg retail clinics connections with regional and state health information technology hubs and coordination among state agencies A uniform nomenclature also would improve consumers understanding of rights and responsibilities Finally the regulatory mechanisms mandatory reporting to licensure to regional planning to the certificate of remain flexible and match the degree of consensus regarding the appropriate regulatory other states have embarked on a assessment of their regulation of ambulatory care services By moving toward adopting the regulatory approach described here New York aims to balance sound oversight with pluralism and innovation in health care delivery View details

HEALTH AFFAIRS Stewart Shah Selna Paulus Walker 2007 26 2 Abstract Most clinical decisions involve bridging the inferential gap Clinicians are required to fill in where they lack knowledge or where no knowledge yet exists In this context we consider how the inferential gap is a product in part of how knowledge is created the limits to gaining access to such knowledge and the variable ways in which knowledge is translated into decisions We consider how electronic health records EHRs will help narrow this gap by accelerating the creation of evidence relevant to everyday practice needs and facilitating use of knowledge in practice View details for DOI View details for Web of Science ID 000244763500057 View details for PubMedID 17259202 View details for PubMedCentralID PMC2670472 What is

controlled trials observational studies and the hierarchy of research designs NEW ENGLAND JOURNAL OF MEDICINE Concato Shah Horwitz I 2000 342 25 Abstract In the hierarchy of research designs the results of randomized controlled trials are considered to be evidence of the highest grade whereas observational studies are viewed as having less validity because they reportedly overestimate treatment effects We used published to identify randomized clinical trials and observational studies that examined the same clinical topics We then compared the results of the original reports according to the type of research search of the Medline data base for articles published in five major medical journals from 1991 to 1995 identified of randomized controlled trials and of either cohort or studies that assessed the same intervention For each of five topics summary estimates and 95 percent confidence intervals were calculated on the basis of data from the individual randomized controlled trials and the individual observational the five clinical topics and 99 reports evaluated the average results of the observational studies were remarkably similar to those of the randomized controlled trials For example analysis of 13 randomized controlled trials of the effectiveness of bacille vaccine in preventing active tuberculosis yielded a relative risk of 95 percent confidence interval to among vaccinated patients as compared with an odds ratio of 95 percent confidence interval to from 10 studies In addition the range of the point estimates for the effect of vaccination was wider for the randomized controlled trials to than for the observational studies to results of observational studies with either a cohort or a design do not systematically overestimate the magnitude of the effects of treatment as compared with those in randomized controlled trials on the same topic View details for Web of Science ID 000087704700007 View details for PubMedID 10861325 View details
