patients with psoriatic arthritis who were treated with ixekizumab in three clinical trials Integrated safety data from three trials controlled and uncontrolled including two pivotal phase 3 randomized clinical trials and were assessed Safety data were integrated from the all ixekizumab exposure safety population defined as all patients receiving dose of ixekizumab We report incidence rates IRs per 100 PY at intervals up to 3years for adverse Total exposure to IXE reached PY 1118 patients The PY for the following treatment discontinuations were as follows adverse events serious infections reactions infections and deaths The IRs for adverse events decreased or remained stable over time the most common being upper respiratory tract infection nasopharyngitis and reactions The IRs for serious adverse events and serious infections remained stable over time whereas for reactions and general infections IRs decreased with longer ixekizumab exposure Opportunistic infections were limited to oral and esophageal candida and localized herpes zoster No suicide or behaviors were reported The PY for safety topics of special interest included inflammatory bowel disease adjudicated depression malignancies and major adverse cardiovascular events The findings of this integrated safety analysis in patients with psoriatic arthritis are consistent with the known safety profile of

rheumatoid arthritis RA who achieved sustained disease control with baricitinib 4 mg once a who completed a baricitinib phase 3 study could enter a extension LTE In the LTE patients who received baricitinib 4 mg for months and maintained CDAI low disease activity LDA or remission REM were blindly randomised to continue 4 mg or taper to 2 mg Patients could rescue to 4 mg if needed Efficacy and safety were assessed through 48 in both groups maintained LDA 80 4 mg 67 2 mg or REM 40 4 mg 33 2 mg over 48 weeks However dose reduction resulted in small statistically significant increases in disease activity at 12 24 and 48 weeks Dose reduction also produced earlier and more frequent relapse loss of criteria over 48 weeks compared with 4 mg maintenance 23 4 mg vs 37 2 mg Rescue rates were 10 for baricitinib 4 mg and 18 for baricitinib 2 mg Dose reduction was associated with a numerically lower rate of infections for baricitinib 4 mg vs for 2 mg Rates of serious adverse events and adverse events leading to discontinuation were similar across a large randomised blinded phase 3 study maintenance of RA control following induction of sustained with baricitinib 4 mg was greater with continued 4 mg than after taper to 2 mg Nonetheless most patients tapered to 2 mg could maintain or recapture with return to 4 mg if needed View details for PubMedID 30194275 View details for

OSK1 2 and 3 studies Phase III clinical trials testing efficacy of fostamatinib with baseline serum biomarkers C1M C3M CRP and RF were included Van der Heijde mTSS was calculated at baseline and Progression was defined as moderate or rapid by DeltamTSS Patients were divided into subgroups low L high H or very high V C1M C3M and CRP or RF negative positive and high positive Difference in clinical parameters were analyzed by or chi2tests and modelling for prediction of progression by logistic regression including covariates age gender BMI and clinical assessment scores Levels of C1M C3M CRP and RF were significantly p associated with measures of disease activity and mTSS at baseline For prognostic measures there were and as many rapid progressors in the C1MH and CRPH p and in the C1MV and CRPV groups p compared C1ML and CRPL respectively C1M and CRP performed similarly in the predictive analysis where high levels predicted moderate and rapid progression with odds ratio of to

data from electronic health records EHRs On behalf of the American College of Rheumatology ACR we sought to develop and test eCQMs for rheumatoid arthritis RA from published ACR guidelines a working group developed candidate RA process measures and subsequently assessed face validity through an interdisciplinary panel of health care stakeholders A public comment period followed Measures that passed these levels of review were electronically specified using the quality data model which provides standard nomenclature for data elements category datatype and value sets obtained through an EHR For each eCQM 3 clinical sites using different EHR systems tested the scientific feasibility and validity of measures Measures appropriate for accountability were presented for national panel validity ratings were high for all measures median of 9 Health system performance on the eCQMs was for RA disease activity assessment for functional status assessment for antirheumatic drug DMARD use and for tuberculosis screening Kappa statistics which evaluated whether the eCQM validly captured data obtained from manual EHR chart review demonstrated moderate to substantial agreement for functional status assessment for tuberculosis screening for disease activity and for DMARD use eCQMs for RA have achieved national endorsement and are recommended for use in federal quality reporting programs

EPIDEMIOLOGY AND INFECTION Mukherjee Herzig Jeon Lee Apa Genovese Gage Koenigsmann Lowy Larson 2014 142 3 Abstract To assess the prevalence and risk factors for colonization with Staphylococcus aureus in inmates entering two prisons in New York State USA inmates were interviewed and anterior nares and oropharyngeal samples collected Isolates were characterized using spa typing Overall of women and of men were colonized with aureus and of women and of men were colonized with MRSA at either or both body sites Of MSSA isolates the major subtypes were spa type 008 and 002 Overall risk factors for aureus colonization varied by gender and were only found in women and included younger age general health and longer length of prior incarceration Prevalence of MRSA colonization was nearly 10 times greater than in the general population Control of epidemic aureus in prisons should consider the constant introduction of strains by new inmates View details for DOI View details for Web of Science ID

treatment of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases is under development These therapies interrupt intracellular signalling through kinase inhibition By interrupting one or more kinases it is possible to modulate the function of cellular structures such as surface receptors signalling proteins and transcription of nuclear proteins and thus influence the behaviour of the cell types targeted With these advances comes the significant potential to develop highly effective orally bioavailable therapeutics The targets generating the greatest enthusiasm at this time for the treatment of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases include kinase spleen tyrosine kinase Bruton tyrosine kinase and kinase Ultimately human trials will help us understand the potential risks and benefits of these novel

Effects of sclerostin antibody on healing of a size femoral bone defect JOURNAL OF ORTHOPAEDIC RESEARCH Jawad Fritton Ma Ren Goodman Ke Babij Genovese 2013 31 1 Abstract Sclerostin is a glycoprotein secreted by osteocytes and inhibits osteoblastogenesis via inhibition of Wnt signaling We hypothesized that sclerostin antibody would accelerate the healing of a murine femoral size bone defect model A unilateral and unicortical drill hole was made in the proximal femoral shaft of adult female nude mice One group of mice received subcutaneous injections of and a second group received vehicle only Reporter MC3T3 osteoprogenitor cells were injected via the tail vein 3 days after surgery to monitor systemic trafficking of exogenous osteoprogenitors Bioluminescence imaging BLI microcomputed tomography microCT micropositron emission tomography microPET and histological analysis were used to compare the bone healing responses to treatment Bone mineral density BMD significantly increased at the defect site after week 1 and was significantly higher in the treatment compared with the control group at all time points This finding was also confirmed on histological analysis by increased deposition of new woven bone MicroPET scanning showed a trend for greater activity in the control group at day 21 compared with the group indicating early bone maturation following treatment with Whereas the BLI signals derived from the injected osteoprogenitor cells showed no differences between vehicle and treated groups systemic migration of MC3T3 cells to the bone defect was clearly identified in both groups using immunohistochemistry Systemic administration of resulted in earlier healing and maturation of a size bone defect These findings underscore the potential use of for

osteolysis due to wear particles Previous studies demonstrated that an oral p38 MAPK inhibitor did not suppress bone formation when given during the initial phase of tissue differentiation However the oral p38 MAPK inhibitor also did not curtail the foreign body and chronic inflammatory response to particles when given simultaneously The purpose of the current study was to examine the efficacy of a p38 MAPK inhibitor on mitigating an established inflammatory reaction that parallels the clinical situation more closely The Bone Harvest Chamber was implanted in rabbits and submicron polyethylene particles were placed in the chamber for 6 weeks The contents of the chambers were harvested every 6 weeks Oral treatment with the included delivery for 3 weeks and stopping for 3 weeks delivery for 3 weeks after an initial delay and delivery for 6 weeks continuously Administration of the continuously for 6 weeks the presence of particles or for the initial 3 of 6 weeks had minor effects on bone ingrowth After establishing a chronic inflammatory reaction for 3 weeks administration of for a subsequent 3 weeks suppressed net bone formation The activity of cells remained low among all treatments when compared with the first control Using the present model the oral p38 MAPK inhibitor was ineffective in improving bone ingrowth in the presence of polyethylene particles View details for DOI View

Abstract therapies have revolutionized the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis RA a common systemic autoimmune disease involving destruction of the synovial joints However in the practice of rheumatology approximately of patients demonstrate no clinical improvement in response to treatment with therapies while another third demonstrate a partial response and an excellent and sustained response Since no clinical or laboratory tests are available to predict response to therapies great need exists for predictive we present a proteomics approach using arthritis antigen arrays a multiplex cytokine assay and conventional ELISA with the objective to identify a biomarker signature in three ethnically diverse cohorts of RA patients treated with the therapy identified a signature that enabled prediction of a positive clinical response to etanercept in all three cohorts positive predictive values 58 to 72 negative predictive values 63 to 78 identified a protein biomarker that enables pretreatment classification and prediction of etanercept responders and tested this biomarker using three independent cohorts of RA patients Although further validation in prospective and larger cohorts is needed our observations demonstrate that multiplex characterization of autoantibodies and cytokines provides clinical utility for predicting response to the therapy etanercept in RA

is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor developed to treat leukemias and subsequently found to treat gastrointestinal stromal tumors We demonstrate that imatinib potently prevents and treats murine arthritis CIA We further show that micromolar concentrations of imatinib abrogate multiple signal transduction pathways implicated in RA pathogenesis including mast cell signaling and release macrophage activation and cytokine production and fibroblast PDGFR signaling and proliferation In our studies imatinib attenuated PDGFR signaling in synoviocytes FLSs and production in synovial fluid mononuclear cells SFMCs derived from human RA patients inhibition of a spectrum of signal transduction pathways and the downstream pathogenic cellular responses may provide a powerful approach to treat RA and

recognition of autoantibody results CLINICAL AND DIAGNOSTIC LABORATORY IMMUNOLOGY Binder Genovese Merrill Morris Metzger 2005 12 12 Abstract antibody ANA screens are increasingly used in the initial evaluation of autoimmune disorders but these tests offer no pattern information comparable to the information from indirect fluorescence screens Thus there is no indication of next steps when a positive result is obtained To improve the utility of ANA screening we evaluated a new method that combines a multiplex immunoassay with a k nearest neighbor kNN algorithm for pattern recognition We assembled a training set consisting of sera from patients with various rheumatic diseases and patients The clinical sensitivity and specificity of the multiplex method and algorithm were evaluated with a test set that consisted of 173 sera collected at a rheumatology clinic from patients diagnosed by using standard criteria as well as 152 and sera from presumably healthy individuals sera collected at a blood bank The test set was also evaluated with a immunosorbent assay ELISA Both the ELISA and multiplex immunoassay results were positive for 94 of the systemic lupus erythematosus SLE patients The kNN algorithm correctly proposed an SLE pattern for 84 of the SLE patients For patients with no connective tissue disease the multiplex method found fewer positive results than the ELISA screen and no disease was proposed by the kNN algorithm for most of these patients In conclusion the automated algorithm could identify SLE patterns and may be useful in the identification of patients who would benefit from early referral to a specialist as well as patients who do not require further evaluation View details for DOI View details for Web of Science ID 000234061400001 View details for

therapeutic objective in patients with rheumatoid arthritis RA is reduction of disease activity with an ultimate goal of disease remission Limitations of currently available antirheumatic drugs and biologic therapies suggest that there remains an unmet need for agents that advance these goals in a greater proportion of patients Progress in our understanding of the regulatory molecules and pathways that mediate the immune and inflammatory responses necessary for the initiation and perpetuation of RA has led to the identification of new targets for therapy It is expected that the therapeutic modulation of these targets which include proinflammatory cytokines T and B cells adhesion molecules chemokines and and extracellular signaling pathways can provide new treatment strategies in patients with RA and other autoimmune disorders Toward this end a series of novel agents with diverse mechanisms of action are in development Although many of these agents are still beyond the clinical horizon several of them have shown promise in recent trials This article reviews a few of the many treatment strategies currently being evaluated which are hoped to lead to greater benefits and better disease management in the clinical setting View details for DOI View details for Web of Science ID 000230136100003 View details for PubMedID 16357750 Temporal effects of a NSAID on

Trindade Ma Genovese Smith 2005 Abstract Wear and periprosthetic osteolysis of total joint replacements continue to be the most important problems in arthroplasty surgery Despite the introduction of improved technologies including alternative bearing surfaces for TJRs wear is inevitable because of relative movement at different interfaces and processes such as electrolysis and material degradation Worn clinically failing implants need to be followed closely and revised when appropriate However early wear and minor osteolysis do not result necessarily in progressive failure of the prosthesis Indeed such cases may be followed up clinically and radiographically to establish the functional and biologic sequelae of wear and the timeline of these events This scenario provides an opportunity to modulate the adverse biologic reaction associated with wear particles that includes chronic inflammation the foreign body response and periprosthetic bone destruction Currently immunological events associated with wear particles are becoming understood more clearly Strategies to mitigate adverse processes associated with wear debris include local or systemic administration of immune modulators signaling molecules agents and growth factors and altering osteoclast function Ultimately prevention of accelerated wear and periprosthetic osteolysis will be achieved with improved bearing surfaces and prosthetic designs View details for DOI View details for PubMedID 15662302 A multicentre randomised double blind placebo controlled phase II study of subcutaneous

signs and symptoms In this paper we will examine the relationship of TNFalpha antagonism and demyelinating disease Reviewing early laboratory and animal models we discuss the mechanism of TNFalpha in central nervous system CNS injury and repair Two negative studies of TNFa inhibitor therapy in the treatment of refractory multiple sclerosis MS are considered From the manufacturers clinical development programs and adverse event reporting data we report the current incidence of demyelinating symptoms associated with each of the commercially available agents Comparing these reports to the incidence of MS in society as a whole we find the rate of new cases of neurologic disease in exposed patients is not different from the rate of expected cases Finally we explore arguments that support and refute a potential biologic relationship between TNFa neutralization and demyelinating disease View details for Web of Science ID 000224406600021 View details for PubMedID 15552527 Effects of

profound reduction in radiographic progression of joint damage as well as a reduction in signs and symptoms of disease Etanercept showed slight superiority to methotrexate in reducing subsequent radiographic erosions and in the rapidity of the clinical response Both therapies proved to be safe and well tolerated and importantly the relative safety and tolerance of a rapidly escalated dosing

MEDICINE Robinson DiGennaro Hueber Haab B KAMACHI Dean Fournel Fong Genovese de Vegvar Skriner Hirschberg Morris Muller Pruijn van Venrooij Smolen Brown Steinman Utz J 2002 8 3 Abstract We constructed miniaturized autoantigen arrays to perform multiplex characterization of autoantibody responses directed against structurally diverse autoantigens using submicroliter quantities of clinical samples Autoantigen microarrays were produced by attaching hundreds of proteins peptides and other biomolecules to the surface of derivatized glass slides using a robotic arrayer Arrays were incubated with patient serum and spectrally resolvable fluorescent labels were used to detect autoantibody binding to specific autoantigens on the array We describe and characterize arrays containing the major autoantigens in eight distinct human autoimmune diseases including systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis This represents the first report of application of such technology to multiple human disease sera and will enable validated detection of antibodies recognizing autoantigens including proteins peptides enzyme complexes ribonucleoprotein complexes DNA and modified antigens Autoantigen microarrays represent a powerful tool to study the specificity and pathogenesis of autoantibody responses and to identify and define relevant autoantigens in human autoimmune diseases View

Boisvert Murphy Vierra Genovese Wardlaw Greenberg Hodge Wu BUTCHER Campbell J 2002 160 1 Abstract Differential expression of adhesion molecules and chemokine receptors has been useful for identification of peripheral blood memory lymphocyte subsets with distinct tissue and microenvironmental tropisms Expression of CCR4 by circulating memory CD4 lymphocytes is associated with cutaneous and other systemic populations while expression of CCR9 is associated with a small subset CCR5 and CXCR3 are also expressed by discrete memory CD4 populations in blood as well as by lymphocytes from a number of sites To characterize the similarities and differences among lymphocytes and to shed light on the specialization of lymphocyte subsets that mediate inflammation and immune surveillance in particular tissues we have examined the expression of CCR4 CXCR3 and CCR5 on CD4 lymphocytes directly isolated from a wide variety of normal and inflamed tissues tissues contained only memory lymphocytes many of which were activated CD69 As predicted by classical studies skin lymphocytes were enriched in CLA expression whereas intestinal lymphocytes were enriched in alpha 4 beta 7 expression CCR4 was expressed at high levels by lymphocytes at lower levels by lung and synovial fluid lymphocytes but never by intestinal lymphocytes Only the high CCR4 levels characteristic of skin lymphocytes were associated with robust chemotactic and adhesive responses to TARC consistent with a selective role for CCR4 in skin lymphocyte homing In contrast CXCR3 and CCR5 were present on the majority of lymphocytes from each tissue examined suggesting that these receptors are unlikely to determine tissue specificity but rather may play a wider role in tissue inflammation View details for

Andrew Wu BUTCHER 2001 108 9 Abstract Current concepts of chemokine receptor CKR association with Th1 and Th2 cell polarization and effector function have largely ignored the diverse nature of effector and memory T cells in vivo Here we systematically investigated the association of 11 CKRs singly or in combination with CD4 T cell polarization We show that Th1 Th2 Th0 and nonpolarized T cells in blood and tissue can express any of the CKRs studied but that each CKR defines a characteristic pool of polarized and nonpolarized CD4 T cells Certain combinations of CKRs define populations that are markedly enriched in major subsets of Th1 versus Th2 cells For example although Th0 Th1 and Th2 cells are each found among blood CD4 T cells coordinately expressing CXCR3 and CCR4 Th1 but not Th2 cells can be CXCR3 CCR4 and Th2 but only rare Th1 cells are CCR4 CXCR3 Contrary to recent reports although CCR7 cells contain a higher frequency of polarized CD4 T cells most Th1 and Th2 effector cells are CCR7 and thus may be capable of lymphoid organ homing Interestingly CKRs show little or no preference for Th1 cells except when they are coexpressed with CXCR3 We conclude that the combinatorial expression of CKRs which allow and targeting of effector cells during chemotactic navigation defines physiologically significant subsets of polarized and nonpolarized T cells View

TLI has been used to treat rheumatoid arthritis RA since the 1970s This study reviews mortality outcomes of patients treated with TLI for RA at Stanford University Medical Center and compares these outcomes with those in patients treated with antirheumatic drugs DMARDs patients with RA were treated with TLI at Stanford University Medical Center All had failed previous therapy with gold salts and penicillamine One hundred six control patients were selected from the Arthritis Rheumatism and Aging Medical Information Systems database and were matched with the patients for age sex disease duration and mean Health Assessment Questionnaire HAQ score Survival was analyzed using methods and Cox proportional hazards significant difference in age and sex was found between patients and controls patients had more education mean years versus years P and received more DMARDs prior to TLI mean versus P patients had lower mean HAQ scores at the time of TLI versus P TLI had no significant overall effect on survival in treated patients compared with controls P The survival curves appeared to cross over at approximately 11 years of followup with better early survival in the TLI group and better late survival in the control group There was a total of 25 deaths in the TLI group There were 45 deaths in the control group with causes of death available for 20 patients There were 3 patients with lymphoma and 2 with myelodysplastic syndrome in the TLI group and none in the control group The most common cause of death in both groups was had no significant effect on overall survival with trends toward higher early mortality in controls and trends toward higher late mortality in patients Overall there was no difference in mortality but it appears that there may have been more lymphoproliferative malignancies in the TLI cohort We would recommend that TLI be used cautiously for patients with refractory RA in whom the benefits outweigh the risks View details for Web of

identified chemokine receptor is expressed by subsets of Th1 or 1 Tc1 cells but not by Th2 or Tc2 cells establishing Bonzo as a differential marker of polarized type 1 T cells in vitro and in vivo Priming of naive T cells by dendritic cells induces expression of Bonzo on T cells enhances this dendritic upregulation while inhibits it In blood of CD4 T cells are Th1 cells and of CD8 T cells are Tc1 cells while few cells are type 2 T cells Almost all Tc1 cells contain preformed granzyme A and display cytotoxic effector phenotype Most T cells lack CCR7 homing receptors for lymphoid tissues Instead T cells are dramatically enriched among T cells in tissue sites of inflammation such as rheumatoid joints and inflamed livers Bonzo may be important in trafficking of effector T cells that mediate type 1 inflammation making it a potential target for therapeutic modulation of inflammatory diseases View details for Web of Science ID 000167337800009 View details for PubMedID 11238560 View

166 2 Abstract CCR7 along with and mediates homing of T cells to secondary lymphoid organs via high endothelial venules HEV CCR7 has also been implicated in microenvironmental positioning of lymphocytes within secondary lymphoid organs and in return of lymphocytes and dendritic cells to the lymph after passage through nonlymphoid tissues We have generated mAbs to human CCR7 whose specificities correlate with functional migration of lymphocyte subsets to known CCR7 ligands We find that CCR7 is expressed on the vast majority of peripheral blood T cells including most cells that express adhesion molecules cutaneous lymphocyte Ag alpha 4 beta 7 integrin required for homing to nonlymphoid tissues A subset of CD27 neg memory CD4 T cells from human peripheral blood is greatly enriched in the CCR7 neg population as well as neg cells suggesting that these cells are incapable of homing to secondary lymphoid organs Accordingly CD27 neg T cells are rare within tonsil a representative secondary lymphoid organ All resting T cells within secondary lymphoid organs express high levels of CCR7 but many activated cells lack CCR7 CCR7 loss in activated CD4 cells accompanies CXC chemokine receptor CXCR 5 gain suggesting that the reciprocal expression of these two receptors may contribute to differential positioning of resting vs activated cells within the organ Lymphocytes isolated from nonlymphoid tissues such as skin lung or intestine contain many CD27 neg cells lacking CCR7 The ratio of CD27 neg neg cells to CD27 pos pos cells varies from tissue to tissue

preventing joint damage in patients with active early rheumatoid arthritis is treated 632 patients with early rheumatoid arthritis with either subcutaneous etanercept 10 or 25 mg or weekly oral methotrexate mean 19 mg per week for 12 months Clinical response was defined as the percent improvement in disease activity according to the criteria of the American College of Rheumatology Bone erosion and narrowing were measured radiographically and scored with use of the Sharp scale On this scale an increase of 1 point represents one new erosion or minimal compared with patients who received methotrexate patients who received the dose of etanercept had a more rapid rate of improvement with significantly more patients having 20 percent 50 percent and 70 percent improvement in disease activity during the first six months P The mean increase in the erosion score during the first 6 months was in the group assigned to receive 25 mg of etanercept and in the methotrexate group and the respective increases during the first 12 months were and Among patients who received the dose of etanercept 72 percent had no increase in the erosion score as compared with 60 percent of patients in the methotrexate group This group of patients also had fewer adverse events and fewer infections than the group that was treated with compared with oral methotrexate subcutaneous corrected

2000 165 6 Abstract epithelial chemokine MEC is a novel chemokine whose mRNA is most abundant in salivary gland with strong expression in other mucosal sites including colon trachea and mammary gland MEC is constitutively expressed by epithelial cells MEC mRNA is detected in cultured bronchial and mammary gland epithelial cell lines and in epithelia isolated from salivary gland and colon using laser capture microdissection but not in the endothelial hemolymphoid or fibroblastic cell lines tested Although MEC is poorly expressed in skin its closest homologue is the cutaneous T chemokine CTACK CCL27 and MEC supports chemotaxis of transfected lymphoid cells expressing CCR10 a known CTACK receptor In contrast to CTACK however MEC also supports migration through CCR3 Consistent with this MEC attracts eosinophils in addition to memory lymphocyte subsets These results suggest an important role for MEC in the physiology of extracutaneous epithelial tissues including diverse mucosal

Roberts Ebert Vierra Goodman Genovese Wardlaw Greenberg Parker Butcher Andrew Agace 2000 192 5 Abstract The immune system has evolved specialized cellular and molecular mechanisms for targeting and regulating immune responses at epithelial surfaces Here we show that small intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytes and lamina propria lymphocytes migrate to chemokine TECK This attraction is mediated by CC chemokine receptor CCR 9 a chemoattractant receptor expressed at high levels by essentially all CD4 and CD8 T lymphocytes in the small intestine Only a small subset of lymphocytes in the colon are CCR9 and lymphocytes from other tissues including tonsils lung inflamed liver normal or inflamed skin inflamed synovium and synovial fluid breast milk and seminal fluid are universally CCR9 TECK expression is also restricted to the small intestine immunohistochemistry reveals that intense reactivity characterizes crypt epithelium in the jejunum and ileum but not in other epithelia of the digestive tract including stomach and colon skin lung or salivary gland These results imply a restricted role for lymphocyte CCR9 and its ligand TECK in the small intestine and provide the first evidence for distinctive mechanisms of lymphocyte recruitment that may permit functional specialization of immune responses in different segments of the gastrointestinal tract Selective expression of chemokines by differentiated epithelium may represent an important mechanism for targeting and specialization of immune responses View details for PubMedID 10974041 A clinical trial of

noted with the DHEA group having greater disease activity at baseline P by physician global assessment Eleven patients were responders patients on DHEA patients on placebo P Of the secondary outcomes mean improvement in SLE disease activity index score was greater in the DHEA group P Bone mineral density at the spine showed significant reduction in the placebo group but was maintained in the DHEA therapy when added to conventional treatment for severe SLE may at most have a small added benefit with respect to lupus outcomes but baseline imbalances in the study population limit the

Toronto SLE Disease Activity Index have been recorded at least quarterly since 1987 on 185 SLE patients We developed a definition of SLE flare and a description of its clinical epidemiology Disease flare was defined as a change of greater than or equal to in the physician global assessment of disease activity measured on a scale from the previous visit or from a visit within the last 93 days Of the 185 patients 98 53 had greater than or equal to 1 flare the total number of flares was 146 The incidence of flare was per of followup The median time from the first study visit to a flare was 12 months Flares were frequently characterized by constitutional symptoms musculoskeletal involvement cutaneous involvement and decreasing levels of C3 and C4 At the time of flare the mean University of Toronto SLE Disease Activity Index score increased by and the mean Lupus Activity Index score modified to omit the physician global assessment increased by Overall of the flares prompted a change in treatment Patients who experienced flares fulfilled more of the SLE criteria at entry and had been followed up for a longer duration after entry into the study compared with those who did not have
