Academic medicine journal of the Association of American Medical Colleges Plowman Peters Brady Osterberg 2019 Abstract The importance of safe effective and prescribing habits can hardly be overstated in the current environment The prescribing process taught in most medical curricula focuses primarily on accurate medical indications While this may be of utmost importance from the clinician perspective it falls short of addressing the other key elements of highly effective prescribing These other elements are often paramount in the minds of patients A framework that associates and incorporates the necessary components of optimal prescribing is overdue Building this framework into medical curricula will foster increased teamwork among providers and enhance shared decision making between patients and clinicians In addition to establishing accurate medical indications prescribing teams need to assure every prescribed medication is desired effective affordable and safe for patients who receive them Prescription writing is an honorable prerogative and doing so safely effectively and requires both teamwork and technology Highly effective prescribing teams can implement the IDEAS Indicated Desired Effective Affordable Safe framework through appropriate and deliberate delegation By empowering members of the care team to support and educate patients this framework will allow physicians to focus on ensuring appropriate indications and effectiveness This novel IDEAS framework serves as an important mental model for medical trainees and reinforces sound prescribing habits among seasoned clinicians and partnerships have the potential to maximize the triple aim improving the patient experience of care improving the health of populations and reducing the per capita cost of health care In an era when costs overwhelm quality providing a fiduciary framework to instill responsibility for optimal prescribing especially among young is invaluable View details for DOI

American Society of Nephrology JASN Brady Ragavan Simon Chertow Milstein A 2019 Abstract Despite growth in payment attributes of nephrology care associated with value remains national health insurance claims data from private preferred provider organization plans we ranked nephrology practices using total cost of care and a composite of common quality metrics Blinded to practice rankings we conducted site visits at four highly ranked and three average ranked practices to identify care attributes more frequently present in highly ranked practices A panel of nephrologists used a modified Delphi method to score each distinguishing attribute on its potential to affect quality and cost of care and ease of transfer to other nephrology with peers practices were located in areas with a relatively higher proportion of black and Hispanic patients and a lower proportion of patients aged 65 years Mean per capita monthly total spending was 24 lower for practices Twelve attributes comprising five general themes were observed more frequently in nephrology practices preventing costly health crises supporting patient maximizing effectiveness of office visits selecting diagnostic and treatment options and developing infrastructure to support care The Delphi panel rated four attributes highly on effect and transferability rapidly adjustable office visit frequency for unstable
