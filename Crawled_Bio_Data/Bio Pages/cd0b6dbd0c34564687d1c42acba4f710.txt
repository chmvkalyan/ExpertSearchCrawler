exploring survival outcomes for patients with bladder cancer most studies rely on conventional statistical methods such as proportional hazards models Given the successful application of machine learning to handle big data in many disciplines outside of medicine we sought to determine if machine learning could be used to improve our ability to predict survival in bladder cancer patients We compare the performance of artificial neural networks ANN a type of machine learning algorithm with that of multivariable Cox proportional hazards CPH models in the prediction of survival DSS and overall survival OS in patients with bladder AND METHODS The National Cancer Institute Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results SEER 18 program database was queried to identify adult patients with bladder cancer diagnosed between 1995 and 2010 yielding patients who met our inclusion criteria ANNs were trained and tested on an split of the dataset Multivariable CPH models were developed in parallel Variables used for prediction included age sex race grade SEER stage tumor size lymph node involvement degree of extension and surgery received The primary outcomes were DSS and OS Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was conducted and ANN models were tested for The area under the curve for the ANN models was for the OS model and for the DSS model Area under the curve for the CPH models was for OS and for DSS The ANN OS model achieved a calibration slope of and a calibration intercept of while the ANN DSS model achieved a calibration slope of and a calibration intercept of Machine learning algorithms can improve our ability to predict bladder cancer prognosis Compared to CPH models ANNs predicted OS more accurately and DSS with similar accuracy Given the inherent

surgical management of muscle invasive bladder cancer Indian journal of urology IJU journal of the Urological Society of India Kukreja J Shah J 33 2 Abstract Bladder cancer remains a disease of the elderly with relatively few advances that have improved survival over the last 20 years Radical cystectomy RC has long remained the principal treatment for bladder cancer MIBC literature search of PubMed was performed The content was reviewed for continuity with the topic of surgical advances in MIBC Articles and society guidelines were included in this the associated morbidity even in the elderly RC is still a reasonable option Modifications during RC may have a positive or negative impact on survival and quality of life The extent of pelvic lymph node dissection is one such factor which may positively impact survival outcomes In addition preservation of pelvic organs robotic surgery and the adoption of enhanced recovery after surgery principles continues to improve the postoperative recovery and quality of life in RC are some ongoing studies in many of these areas but overall the new advances in MIBC may improve patient quality and quantity of life The advances in surgical treatment of MIBC are important and the focus of the review here View details for PubMedID 28469297 View details for PubMedCentralID PMC5396397 Radical cystectomy in women Impact of the

Shariat 2020 Abstract To assess the effect of patient sex on response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy NAC in patients with clinically nonmetastatic bladder cancer MIBC pathologic response defined as ypT0N0 at radical cystectomy and downstaging were evaluated using univariable and multivariable logistic regression modeling We used interaction terms to account for age of menopause and smoking status The association of sex with overall survival and survival was evaluated using Cox regression total of patients were included in the analysis 227 22 of whom were female Female patients had a higher rate of extravesical disease extension P After the administration of NAC ypT stage was equally distributed between sexes P On multivariable logistic regression analyses there was no difference between the sexes or age of menopause with regards to ypT0N0 rates or downstaging all P On Cox regression analyses sex was associated with neither overall survival hazard ratio 95 confidence interval P nor survival hazard ratio 95 confidence interval P study generates the hypothesis that NAC equalizes the preoperative disparity in pathologic stage between males and females suggesting a possible differential response between sexes This might be the explanation underlying the comparable survival outcomes between sexes despite females presenting with more advanced tumor stage View details for

Thorpe Morgan Holzbeierlein Bivalacqua North Barocas Lotan Grivas Stephenson Shah J van Rhijn Spiess Daneshmand Sridhar Black 2019 Abstract INTRODUCTION The ratio NLR is an attractive marker because it is derived from routine bloodwork NLR has shown promise as a prognostic factor in muscle invasive bladder cancer MIBC but its value in patients receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy NAC before radical cystectomy RC is not yet established Since NLR is related to an oncogenic environment and poor antitumor host response we hypothesized that a high NLR would be associated with a poor response to NAC and would remain a poor prognostic indicator in patients receiving A retrospective analysis was performed on patients with nonmetastatic MIBC who received NAC prior to RC between 2000 and 2013 at 1 of 19 centers across Europe and North America The NLR was used to split patients into a low NLR 3 and high NLR 3 group Demographic and clinical parameters were compared between the groups using Student t test or Fisher exact test Putative risk factors for and overall survival were analyzed using Cox regression while predictors of response to NAC defined as absence of MIBC in RC specimen were investigated using logistic Data were available for 340 patients 199 NLR 3 141 NLR 3 Other than age and rate of lymphovascular invasion demographic and pretreatment characteristics did not differ significantly More patients in the NLR 3 group had residual MIBC after NAC than the NLR 3 group P NLR was the only significant predictor of response odds ratio P in logistic regression NLR was a significant risk factor for both hazard ratio HR P and overall survival P NLR 3 was associated with a decreased response to NAC and shorter and overall survival This suggests that NLR is a simple tool

Dose Dense MVAC versus Gemcitabine and Cisplatin in Patients with Bladder Cancer Treated with Radical Cystectomy JOURNAL OF UROLOGY Zargar Shah J van Rhijn Daneshmand Bivalacqua Spiess Black Kassouf 2018 199 6 Abstract Level I evidence supports the usefulness of neoadjuvant cisplatin based chemotherapy for muscle invasive bladder cancer Since dose dense MVAC methotrexate vinblastine doxorubicin and cisplatin has mostly replaced traditional MVAC we compared pathological response and survival rates in patients with locally advanced bladder cancer who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy with dose dense MVAC vs gemcitabine and retrospectively reviewed the records of patients with urothelial cancer who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy and underwent cystectomy at a total of 20 contributing institutions from 2000 to 2015 Patients with disease were selected for this analysis The rates of ypT0N0 and ypT1N0 or less were compared between the gemcitabine and cisplatin and dose dense MVAC regimens Two multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression models of overall mortality were generated using preoperative and postoperative the patients who underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy and radical cystectomy during the study period 319 met our inclusion criteria A significantly lower rate of ypT0N0 was observed in the gemcitabine and cisplatin arm than in the dose dense MVAC arm vs p The rate of ypT1N0 or less was for gemcitabine and cisplatin compared to for dose dense MVAC p The mean estimates of overall survival in the gemcitabine and cisplatin and dose dense MVAC groups were

cancer is a disease of the elderly that is associated with high morbidity in those treated with radical cystectomy In this observational study of patients with bladder cancer undergoing radical cystectomy we analyzed and compared outcomes from those treated with Enhanced Recovery After Surgery ERAS methods versus those who received traditional perioperative enrolled patients who underwent radical cystectomy at a tertiary care referral center from November 2013 to December 2016 when the ERAS concept was being introduced into postoperative care at our institution Patients reported symptom outcomes using the MD Anderson Symptom Inventory preoperatively and on postoperative days 1 to 5 U tests were used to compare symptom burden between the ERAS and groups General linear models were used for longitudinal data linear regression models were used for multivariable N 383 reported dry mouth disturbed sleep drowsiness fatigue pain and lack of appetite as the most severe symptoms Compared with the group the ERAS group had significantly less pain est P drowsiness est P dry mouth est P disturbed sleep est P and interference with functioning est P adjusted for age sex surgical technique and neoadjuvant chemotherapy status results suggest that ERAS practice significantly reduced immediate postoperative symptom burden in bladder cancer patients recovering from radical

therapy and to evaluate its significance in clinical trial reviewed our database of 917 patients who underwent transurethral resection and induction of BCG from 1995 to 2012 Clinical characteristics were compared between recurrence resection of bladder tumor and intravesical analysis and Student t test were used to compare clinical characteristics between recurrence stages method was used to determine time survival and identified 84 patients who met the study criteria 66 patients with cTa and 18 patients with clinical T1 cT1 The median for the entire cohort was 74 mo Of the patients with cTa recurrence 60 continued with therapy Patients with a cTa recurrence who continued therapy had a 17 incidence of disease progression and a 62 incidence of recurrence within 1 No patients with cTa recurrence developed disease progression or underwent radical cystectomy Patients with an initial cTa at diagnosis had a higher bladder preservation rate than those with an initial cT1 diagnosis 84 vs

multimodality treatments for all bladder cancers For superficial disease intravesical instillation of chemotherapeutic agents after transurethral resection is quickly becoming the standard of care Novel therapeutic modalities under investigation include DNA vaccines magnetically targeted carriers bioadhesive microspheres and antisense oligodeoxynucleotides Treatment goals for superficial bladder cancer are complete removal of the initial tumor prevention of disease recurrence and inhibition of progression to invasive disease The myriad novel therapeutic modalities under exploration suggest that these goals may be achievable within our lifetime View details for PubMedID 16618384 Does year of radical prostatectomy independently predict outcome in prostate cancer Urology Mitchell Shah J Olsson Benson McKiernan 2006 67 2 Abstract To examine how the biochemical outcomes after radical prostatectomy RP have changed in the antigen PSA era when controlling for the effects of other prognostic variables Since the beginning of the PSA era the presentation treatment and therapeutic outcomes of prostate cancer have reviewed the Columbia University Comprehensive Urologic Oncology Database and identified 1319 patients who had undergone RP without adjuvant therapy performed by three surgeons between 1988 and 2003 minimal of 12 months Univariate Cox proportional hazards models were used to determine which variables affect the hazard of biochemical failure BCF defined as a PSA level of or greater on at least two occasions after RP Multivariate analysis controlling for the effects of other prognostic variables was used to determine the effect that the year of surgery had on hazard of analysis confirmed the importance of the year of surgery preoperative PSA level pathologic stage Gleason sum and surgical margin status in estimating the hazard of BCF P Age at surgery did not have a statistically significant effect A multivariate Cox model showed that the year of surgery had a highly significant impact on the hazard of BCF even when controlling for PSA stage Gleason sum and surgical margin undergoing RP in more recent years are at significantly less risk of BCF compared with patients who underwent surgery earlier in the PSA era even when controlling for the effects of other prognostic variables The factors that account for this change in outcomes over time have yet to be identified View details for PubMedID 16461087 PSA updated Still relevant in the new millennium EUROPEAN UROLOGY Shah J Reese McKiernan Benson 2005 47 4 View details for DOI View

Fisch Shabsigh 2005 174 3 Abstract Metabolic syndrome characterized by central obesity insulin resistance dyslipidemia and hypertension is highly prevalent in the United States When left untreated it significantly increases the risk of diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease It has been suggested that hypogonadism may be an additional component of metabolic syndrome This has potential implications for the treatment of metabolic syndrome with testosterone We reviewed the available literature on metabolic syndrome and hypogonadism with a particular focus on testosterone comprehensive MEDLINE review of the world literature from 1988 to 2004 on hypogonadism testosterone and metabolic syndrome was data suggest that metabolic syndrome is strongly associated with hypogonadism in men Multiple interventional studies have shown that exogenous testosterone has a favorable impact on body mass insulin secretion and sensitivity lipid profile and blood pressure which are the parameters most often disturbed in metabolic is likely a fundamental component of metabolic syndrome Testosterone therapy may not only treat hypogonadism but may also have tremendous potential to slow or halt the progression from metabolic syndrome to overt diabetes or cardiovascular disease via beneficial effects on insulin regulation lipid profile and blood pressure Furthermore the use of testosterone to treat metabolic syndrome may also lead to the prevention of urological complications commonly associated with these chronic disease states such as neurogenic bladder and erectile dysfunction Physicians must be mindful to evaluate hypogonadism in all men diagnosed with metabolic syndrome as well as metabolic syndrome in all men diagnosed with hypogonadism Future research in the form of randomized clinical trials should focus on further defining the role of testosterone for metabolic syndrome View details for PubMedID 16093964 Novel therapeutics in the treatment of bladder cancer Current opinion in urology Shah J McKiernan 2004 14 5 Abstract The successful treatment of bladder cancer remains a challenge for urologists and oncologists There have been substantial changes in the therapeutic options for the management of both superficial and bladder cancer in the last 5 years Here we review the preclinical and clinical developments over the last year in bladder cancer is a growing trend toward the use of multimodal treatments for all bladder cancers For superficial disease intravesical instillation of chemotherapeutic agents after transurethral resection is quickly becoming the standard of care Novel therapeutic modalities under investigation include DNA vaccines magnetically targeted carriers microspheres and antisense oligodeoxynucleotides For bladder cancer systemic perioperative chemotherapy is being used with increasing frequency and the latest preclinical research efforts are focused on the inhibition of angiogenesis and other processes predisposing to metastatic goals for bladder cancer of any stage are complete removal of the initial tumor prevention of disease recurrence and effective inhibition of progression to advanced disease with the ultimate aim of reducing mortality The myriad novel therapeutic modalities currently being explored suggest that these goals may perhaps be achievable within our lifetime View details for PubMedID

increased amount of free damage in diseased vs healthy tissue from patients with chronic study Samples of heathly and diseased tissue were taken from each patient Lipid peroxides LPOs are a of free damage LPO levels and ratios were determined for each series of 13 human subjects undergoing functional endoscopic sinus surgery to treat chronic mean ratio for healthy tissue was x 10 while that for the diseased tissue was x 10 There was no statistically significant difference in the ratio between healthy and diseased tissue 95 confidence interval x 10 to x 10 damage if present was the same in infected and control tissues in this pilot investigation into the pathophysiologic characteristics of human chronic rhinosinusitis View details for PubMedID 12220211 Report Accessibility Issues
