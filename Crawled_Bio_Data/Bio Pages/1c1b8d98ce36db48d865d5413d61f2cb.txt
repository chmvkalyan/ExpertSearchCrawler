physiology lifestyle and behavior They also differ in disease susceptibility and life span Although the genomes of many organisms have now been completely sequenced we still know relatively little about the specific DNA sequence changes that underlie interesting traits My laboratory is using a combination of genetic and genomic approaches to identify the detailed molecular mechanisms that control evolutionary change in vertebrates with a focus on five fundamental questions 1 Are new evolutionary traits controlled by countless genetic differences of small effect or by a few genetic changes with large effects 2 What specific genes have changed to produce interesting evolutionary differences seen in nature 3 What kinds of mutations have occurred in these genes dominant or recessive coding or regulatory preexisting or de novo 4 How predictable is evolution If you know how evolution has occurred in one population is it possible to predict the genes and mutations that also underlie the same trait in different populations 5 How has evolution produced the unique characteristics of humans We study these questions using a variety of methods in mice sticklebacks and people Mice are often the best system available for asking detailed mechanistic questions in mammals or testing the phenotypic effects of particular sequence changes seen in other species We have used classical genetics in mice to identify fundamental pathways that control formation and patterning of cartilage bone and joints We also make extensive use of mice identifying the regulatory mechanisms that lay out expression of key developmental control genes with the ultimate aim of identifying how vertebrate morphology itself is encoded in the offer an unusually powerful system for studying the molecular basis of evolutionary change in naturally occurring species Our lab has pioneered the development of a large number of new genetic and genomic resources for the fish and has worked with Hudson Alpha Institute and the Broad Institute to develop a whole genome sequence assembly for sticklebacks Using these new tools we have now successfully identified both the molecular mechanisms that control repeated evolution of armor plate patterning pelvic reduction and spine and skin color changes in nature Our studies show that big evolutionary changes can be controlled by single chromosome regions The big changes are controlled by alterations in major developmental control genes key signaling molecules and transcription factors Although null mutations in these genes are typically deleterious or lethal sticklebacks have made regulatory alterations in these genes that produce large morphological effects in particular tissues while preserving overall viability Interestingly the same genes are used repeatedly when similar phenotypes evolve in different populations revealing a surprising commonality to the molecular mechanisms that control rapid evolutionary change in diverse organisms Although many of our studies have begun in mice or sticklebacks the genes and mechanisms that we have also turn out to control major differences in human morphology hair color arthritis susceptibility and incidence of major psychiatric diseases in billions of people around the world Building on this work we have now begun a variety of projects to identify other mechanisms responsible for key evolutionary traits and diseases in humans Although we are still far from knowing the detailed molecular basis of most human traits we are optimistic that many aspects of this problem can now be studied both computationally and experimentally and will provide new insights into both human origins and human medicine Courses Genetics and Developmental Biology Training CampDBIO 200 GENE 200

fragility in the parallel evolution of pelvic reduction in stickleback fish Science New York Xie Wang Thompson Wucherpfennig Reimchen MacColl Schluter Bell Vasquez Kingsley 2019 363 6422 Abstract Evolution generates a remarkable breadth of living forms but many traits evolve repeatedly by mechanisms that are still poorly understood A classic example of repeated evolution is the loss of pelvic hindfins in stickleback fish Gasterosteus aculeatus Repeated pelvic loss maps to recurrent deletions of a pelvic enhancer of the Pitx1 gene Here we identify molecular features contributing to these recurrent deletions Pitx1 enhancer sequences form alternative DNA structures in vitro and increase breaks and deletions in vivo Enhancer mutability depends on DNA replication direction and is caused by repeats Modeling shows that elevated mutation rates can influence evolution under demographic conditions relevant for sticklebacks and humans DNA fragility may thus help explain why the same loci are often used repeatedly during parallel adaptive evolution View details for PubMedID 30606845 Characterization of a Tandem Repeat Associated with Bipolar Disorder and Schizophrenia American journal of human genetics Song Lowe Kingsley 2018 Abstract Bipolar disorder BD and schizophrenia SCZ are highly heritable diseases that affect more than 3 of individuals worldwide association studies have strongly and repeatedly linked risk for both of these neuropsychiatric diseases to a 100 kb interval in the third intron of the human calcium channel gene CACNA1C However the causative mutation is not yet known We have identified a tandem repeat in this region that is composed of 30bp units often repeated hundreds of times This large tandem repeat is unstable using standard polymerase chain reaction and bacterial cloning techniques which may have resulted in its incorrect size in the human reference genome The large repeat region is polymorphic in both size and sequence in human populations Particular sequence variants of the are associated with risk status at several flanking polymorphisms in the third intron of CACNA1C that have previously been linked to BD and SCZ The tandem repeat arrays function as enhancers that increase reporter gene expression in a human neural progenitor cell line Different human arrays vary in the magnitude of enhancer activity and the arrays associated with increased psychiatric disease risk status have decreased enhancer activity Changes in the structure and sequence of these arrays likely contribute to changes in CACNA1C function during human evolution and may modulate neuropsychiatric disease risk in modern human populations View details for PubMedID 30100087 Ancient selection for derived alleles at a GDF5 enhancer influencing human growth and osteoarthritis risk Nature genetics Capellini Chen Cao Doxey Kiapour Schoor Kingsley 2017 49 8 Abstract Variants in GDF5 are associated with human arthritis and decreased height but the causal mutations are still unknown We surveyed the Gdf5 locus for regulatory regions in transgenic mice and separate enhancers controlling expression in joints versus growing ends of long bones A large downstream regulatory region contains a novel growth enhancer GROW1 which is required for normal Gdf5 expression at ends of developing bones and for normal bone lengths in vivo Human GROW1 contains a common change that decreases enhancer activity and colocalizes with peaks of positive selection in humans The derived allele is rare in Africa but common in Eurasia and is found in Neandertals and Denisovans Our results suggest that an ancient regulatory variant in GROW1 has been repeatedly selected in northern environments and that past selection on growth phenotypes explains the high frequency of a GDF5 haplotype that also increases arthritis susceptibility in many human populations View details for PubMedID 28671685 Evolving New Skeletal Traits by Changes in Bone Morphogenetic Proteins Cell Indjeian Kingman Jones Guenther Grimwood Schmutz Myers Kingsley 2016 164 Abstract Changes in bone size and shape are defining features of many vertebrates Here we use genetic crosses and comparative genomics to identify specific regulatory DNA alterations controlling skeletal evolution Armor differences in sticklebacks map to a major effect locus overlapping BMP family member GDF6 Freshwater fish express more GDF6 due in part to a transposon insertion and transgenic overexpression of GDF6 phenocopies evolutionary changes in size The human GDF6 locus also has undergone distinctive regulatory evolution including complete loss of an enhancer that is otherwise highly conserved between chimps and other mammals Functional tests show that the ancestral enhancer drives expression in hindlimbs but not forelimbs in locations that have been specifically modified during the human transition to bipedalism Both gain and loss of regulatory elements can localize BMP

obvious examples of phenotypic variation in humans Although association studies GWAS have implicated multiple loci in human pigment variation the causative changes are still largely unknown Here we dissect a regulatory region of the KITLG gene encoding KIT ligand that is significantly associated with common blond hair color in northern Europeans Functional tests demonstrate that the region contains a regulatory enhancer that drives expression in developing hair follicles This enhancer contains a common SNP rs12821256 that alters a binding site for the lymphoid factor 1 LEF1 transcription factor reducing LEF1 responsiveness and enhancer activity in cultured human keratinocytes Mice carrying ancestral or derived variants of the human KITLG enhancer exhibit significant differences in hair pigmentation confirming that altered regulation of an essential growth factor contributes to the classic blond hair phenotype found in northern Europeans View details for DOI View

colonized and adapted to thousands of streams and lakes formed since the last ice age providing an exceptional opportunity to characterize genomic mechanisms underlying repeated ecological adaptation in nature Here we develop a reference genome assembly for threespine sticklebacks By sequencing the genomes of twenty additional individuals from a global set of marine and freshwater populations we identify a set of loci that are consistently associated with divergence Our results indicate that reuse of globally shared standing genetic variation including chromosomal inversions has an important role in repeated evolution of distinct marine and freshwater sticklebacks and in the maintenance of divergent ecotypes during early stages of reproductive isolation Both coding and regulatory changes

Bejerano Kingsley 2011 471 7337 Abstract Humans differ from other animals in many aspects of anatomy physiology and behaviour however the genotypic basis of most traits remains unknown Recent comparisons have made it possible to identify genes with elevated rates of amino acid change or divergent expression in humans and sequences with accelerated base pair changes Regulatory alterations may be particularly likely to produce phenotypic effects while preserving viability and are known to underlie interesting evolutionary differences in other species Here we identify molecular events particularly likely to produce significant regulatory changes in humans complete deletion of sequences otherwise highly conserved between chimpanzees and other mammals We confirm 510 such deletions in humans which fall almost exclusively in regions and are enriched near genes involved in steroid hormone signalling and neural function One deletion removes a sensory vibrissae and penile spine enhancer from the human androgen receptor AR gene a molecular change correlated with anatomical loss of sensory vibrissae and penile spines in the human lineage Another deletion removes a forebrain subventricular zone enhancer near the tumour suppressor gene growth arrest and gamma GADD45G a loss correlated with expansion of specific brain regions in humans Deletions of enhancers may thus accompany both loss and gain traits in the human lineage and provide specific examples of the kinds of regulatory alterations and inactivation events long proposed to have an important role in human

Kingsley 2010 327 5963 Abstract The molecular mechanisms underlying major phenotypic changes that have evolved repeatedly in nature are generally unknown Pelvic loss in different natural populations of threespine stickleback fish has occurred through regulatory mutations deleting a enhancer of the Pituitary homeobox transcription factor 1 Pitx1 gene The high prevalence of deletion mutations at Pitx1 may be influenced by inherent structural features of the locus Although Pitx1 null mutations are lethal in laboratory animals Pitx1 regulatory mutations show molecular signatures of positive

Infante Menke Kingsley 2018 7 Abstract Vertebrate pelvic reduction is a classic example of repeated evolution Recurrent loss of pelvic appendages in sticklebacks has previously been linked to natural mutations in a pelvic enhancer that maps upstream of Pitx1 The sequence of this upstream PelA enhancer is not conserved to mammals so we have surveyed a large region surrounding the mouse Pitx1 gene for other possible hind limb control sequences Here we identify a new pelvic enhancer PelB that maps downstream rather than upstream of Pitx1 PelB drives expression in the posterior portion of the developing hind limb and deleting the sequence from mice alters the size of several hind limb structures PelB sequences are broadly conserved from fish to mammals A wild stickleback population lacking the pelvis has an mutation that disrupts the structure and function of PelB suggesting that changes in this ancient enhancer contribute to evolutionary modification of pelvic appendages in nature View

method to detect copy number variants CNVs that are differentially present between two groups of sequenced samples We use a transducer where the emitted read depth is conditioned on the mappability and of all reads that occur at a given base position In this model the read depth within a region is a mixture of binomials which in simulations matches the read depth more closely than the negative binomial distribution The method analyzes all samples simultaneously preserving uncertainty as to the breakpoints and magnitude of CNVs present in an individual when it identifies CNVs differentially present between the two groups We apply this method to identify CNVs that are recurrently associated with postglacial adaptation of marine threespine stickleback Gasterosteus aculeatus to freshwater We identify 6664 regions of the stickleback genome totaling Mbp which show consistent copy number differences between marine and freshwater populations These deletions and duplications affect both genes elements including a noncoding intronic telencephalon enhancer ofDCHS1The functions of the genes near or included within the 6664 CNVs are enriched for immunity and muscle development as well as head and limb morphology Although freshwater stickleback have repeatedly evolved from marine populations we show that freshwater stickleback also act as reservoirs for ancient ancestral sequences that are highly conserved among distantly related teleosts but largely missing from marine stickleback due to recent selective sweeps in marine populations View details for PubMedID 29229672 View details

Abstract A substantial part of biodiversity is thought to have arisen from adaptive radiations in which one lineage rapidly diversified into multiple lineages specialized to many different niches However selection and drift reduce genetic variation during adaptation to new niches and may thus prevent or slow down further niche shifts We tested whether rapid adaptation is still possible from a highly derived ecotype in the adaptive radiation of threespine stickleback on the Haida Gwaii archipelago Western Canada In a selection experiment we let giant sticklebacks from a large blackwater lake evolve in a small clearwater pond without vertebrate predators A total of 56 whole genomes from the experiment and 26 natural populations revealed that adaptive genomic change was rapid in many small genomic regions and encompassed 75 of the change between ecotypes Genomic change was as fast as phenotypic change in defence and trophic morphology and both were largely parallel between the selection experiment and natural adaptive radiation Our results show that functionally relevant standing genetic variation can persist in derived radiation members allowing adaptive radiations to unfold very rapidly View details for PubMedID 29942074 Convergent evolution of SWS2 opsin facilitates adaptive radiation of threespine stickleback into different light environments PLOS BIOLOGY Marques Taylor Jones Di Palma Kingsley Reimchen 2017 15 4 Abstract Repeated adaptation to a new environment often leads to convergent phenotypic changes whose underlying genetic mechanisms are rarely known Here we study adaptation of color vision in threespine stickleback during the repeated postglacial colonization of clearwater and blackwater lakes in the Haida Gwaii archipelago We use whole genomes from 16 clearwater and 12 blackwater populations and a selection experiment in which stickleback were transplanted from a blackwater lake into an uninhabited clearwater pond and resampled after 19 y to test for selection on cone opsin genes Patterns of haplotype homozygosity genetic diversity site frequency spectra and change support a selective sweep centered on the adjacent and sensitive opsins SWS2 and LWS The haplotype under selection carries seven amino acid changes in SWS2 including two changes known to cause a in light absorption and is favored in blackwater lakes but disfavored in the clearwater habitat of the transplant population Remarkably the same amino acid changes occurred after the duplication of SWS2 198 million years ago in the ancestor of most fish Two distantly related fish species bluefin killifish and black bream express these old paralogs divergently in and clearwater habitats while sticklebacks lost one paralog Our study thus shows that convergent adaptation to the same environment can involve the same genetic changes on very different evolutionary time scales by reevolving lost mutations and reusing them repeatedly from standing

MSX2A BMC biology Howes Summers Kingsley 2017 15 1 115 Abstract Dorsal spine reduction in threespine sticklebacks Gasterosteus aculeatus is a classic example of recurrent skeletal evolution in nature Sticklebacks in marine environments typically have long spines that form part of their skeletal armor Many derived freshwater populations have evolved shorter spines Changes in spine length are controlled in part by a quantitative trait locus QTL previously mapped to chromosome 4 but the causative gene and mutations underlying the repeated evolution of this interesting skeletal trait have not been mapping of the spine length QTL shows that it lies near the MSX2A transcription factor gene MSX2A is expressed in developing spines In F1 marine freshwater fish the marine allele is preferentially expressed Differences in expression can be attributed to splicing regulation Due to the use of an alternative site within the first exon the freshwater allele produces greater amounts of a shortened transcript and makes less of the transcript Sequence changes in the MSX2A region are shared by many freshwater fish suggesting that repeated evolution occurs by reuse of a variant To demonstrate the effect of MSX2A on spine length we produced transgenic freshwater fish expressing a copy of marine MSX2A The spines of the transgenic fish were significantly longer on average than those of their siblings partially reversing the reduced spine lengths that have evolved in freshwater is a major gene underlying dorsal spine reduction in freshwater sticklebacks The gene is linked to a separate gene controlling bony plate loss helping explain the concerted effects of chromosome 4 on multiple traits The nature of the molecular changes provides an interesting example of morphological evolution occurring not through a simple amino acid change nor through a change only in gene expression levels but through a change in the ratio of splice products encoding both normal and truncated proteins View details for PubMedID 29212540 View details for PubMedCentralID PMC5719529 Genetic Coupling of Female Mate Choice with Polygenic Ecological Divergence Facilitates Stickleback Speciation Current biology CB Bay Arnegard Conte Best Bedford McCann Dubin Chan Jones Kingsley Schluter Peichel 2017 27 21 Abstract Ecological speciation with gene flow is widespread in nature 1 but it presents a conundrum how are associations between traits under divergent natural selection and traits that contribute to assortative mating maintained Theoretical models suggest that genetic mechanisms inhibiting free recombination between loci underlying these two types of traits hereafter genetic coupling can facilitate speciation Here we perform a direct test for genetic coupling by mapping both divergent traits and female mate choice in a classic model of ecological speciation sympatric benthic and limnetic threespine stickleback Gasterosteus aculeatus By measuring mate choice in F2 hybrid females we allowed for recombination between loci underlying assortative mating and those under divergent ecological selection In mating arenas in which females had access to both benthic and limnetic males we found that F2 females mated with males similar to themselves in body size and shape In addition we found two quantitative trait loci QTLs associated with female mate choice that also predicted female morphology along the trait axis Furthermore a polygenic genetic model that explains adaptation to contrasting benthic and limnetic feeding niches 5 also predicted F2 female mate choice Together these results provide empirical evidence that genetic coupling of assortative mating with traits under divergent ecological selection helps maintain species in the face of gene flow despite a polygenic basis for adaptation to divergent environments View details for PubMedID 29056455 View details for PubMedCentralID PMC5687276 Beautiful Piles of Bones An Interview with

the field of genetics in the last 15 years Recipients of the GSA Medal are recognized for elegant and highly meaningful contributions to modern genetics exemplifying the ingenuity of GSA membership The 2017 recipient is David Kingsley whose work in mouse sticklebacks and humans has shifted paradigms about how vertebrates evolve Kingsley first fell in love with genetics in graduate school where he worked on receptor mediated endocytosis with Monty Krieger In his postdoctoral training he was able to unite genetics with his first scientific love vertebrate morphology He joined the group of Neal Copeland and Nancy Jenkins where he led efforts to map the classical mouse skeletal mutationshort earConvinced that experimental genetics had a unique power to reveal the inner workings of evolution Kingsley then established the stickleback fish as an extraordinarily productive model of quantitative trait evolution in wild species He and his colleagues revealed many important insights including the discoveries that major morphological differences can map to key loci with large effects that regulatory changes in essential developmental control genes have produced advantageous new traits and that nature has selected the same genes over and over again to drive the stickleback skeletal evolution Recently Kingsley group has been using these lessons to reveal more about how our own

dissection of conserved transcriptional regulation in intestinal epithelial cells PLoS biology Lickwar Camp Weiser Cocchiaro Kingsley Furey Sheikh Rawls 2017 15 8 e2002054 Abstract The intestinal epithelium serves critical physiologic functions that are shared among all vertebrates However it is unknown how the transcriptional regulatory mechanisms underlying these functions have changed over the course of vertebrate evolution We generated mRNA and accessible chromatin data from adult intestinal epithelial cells IECs in zebrafish stickleback mouse and human species to determine if conserved IEC functions are achieved through common transcriptional regulation We found evidence for substantial common regulation and conservation of gene expression regionally along the length of the intestine from fish to mammals and identified a core set of genes comprising a vertebrate IEC signature We also identified transcriptional start sites and other putative regulatory regions that are differentially accessible in IECs in all 4 species Although these sites rarely showed sequence conservation from fish to mammals surprisingly they drove highly conserved IEC expression in a zebrafish reporter assay Common putative transcription factor binding sites TFBS found at these sites in multiple species indicate that sequence conservation alone is insufficient to identify much of the functionally conserved IEC regulatory information Among the rare highly regulatory regions we discovered an ancient enhancer upstream from that is active in a distinct population of cells in the intestinal epithelium Together these results show how combining accessible chromatin and mRNA datasets with TFBS prediction and in vivo reporter assays can reveal regulatory information conserved across 420 million years of vertebrate evolution We define an IEC transcriptional regulatory network that is shared between fish and mammals and establish an experimental platform for studying how evolutionarily distilled regulatory information commonly controls IEC development and physiology View details for PubMedID 28850571 View details for PubMedCentralID PMC5574553 An Unexpectedly Complex Architecture for Skin Pigmentation in Africans Cell Martin Lin Granka Myrick Liu Sockell Atkinson Werely Möller Sandhu Kingsley Hoal Liu Daly Feldman Gignoux Bustamante Henn 2017 171 6 Abstract Approximately 15 genes have been directly associated with skin pigmentation variation in humans leading to its characterization as a relatively simple trait However by assembling a global survey of quantitative skin pigmentation phenotypes we demonstrate that pigmentation is more complex than previously assumed with genetic architecture varying by latitude We investigate polygenicity in the KhoeSan populations indigenous to southern Africa who have considerably lighter skin than equatorial Africans We demonstrate that skin pigmentation is highly heritable but known pigmentation loci explain only a small fraction of the variance Rather baseline skin pigmentation is a complex polygenic trait in the KhoeSan Despite this we identify canonical and skin pigmentation loci including near SLC24A5 TYRP1 and SNX13 using a association approach complemented by targeted resequencing By considering diverse African populations we show how the architecture of skin pigmentation can vary across humans subject to different local evolutionary pressures View details for PubMedID 29195075 Heads Shoulders Elbows Knees and Toes Modular Gdf5 Enhancers Control Different Joints in the Vertebrate

skeletal defects and degenerative diseases in humans Growth and differentiation factor 5 Gdf5 is one of the earliest markers of joint formation is required for normal joint development in both mice and humans and has been genetically linked to risk of common osteoarthritis in Eurasian populations Here we systematically survey the mouse Gdf5 gene for regulatory elements controlling expression in synovial joints We identify separate regions of the locus that control expression in axial tissues in proximal versus distal joints in the limbs and in remarkably specific of composite joints like the elbow Predicted transcription factor binding sites within Gdf5 regulatory enhancers are required for expression in particular joints The multiple enhancers that control Gdf5 expression in different joints are distributed over a hundred kilobases of DNA including regions both upstream and downstream of Gdf5 coding exons Functional rescue tests in mice confirm that the large flanking regions are required to restore normal joint formation and patterning Orthologs of these enhancers are located throughout the large genomic region previously associated with common osteoarthritis risk in humans The large array of modular enhancers for Gdf5 provide a new foundation for studying the spatial specificity of joint patterning in vertebrates as well as new candidates for regulatory regions that may also influence osteoarthritis risk in human populations View details for DOI View details for Web of Science ID 000392129600046 View details for PubMedID 27902701 View details for PubMedCentralID

tissues Previous studies have shown that null mutations in the mouse Bmp5 gene alter the size shape and number of multiple bone and cartilage structures during development Bmp5 mutations also delay healing of rib fractures in adult mutants suggesting that the same signals used to pattern embryonic bone and cartilage are also reused during skeletal regeneration and repair Despite intense interest in BMPs as agents for stimulating bone formation in clinical applications little is known about the regulatory elements that control developmental or BMP expression To compare the DNA sequences that activate gene expression during embryonic bone formation and following acute injuries in adult animals we assayed regions surrounding the Bmp5 gene for their ability to stimulate lacZ reporter gene expression in transgenic mice Multiple genomic fragments distributed across the Bmp5 locus collectively coordinate expression in discrete anatomic domains during normal development including in embryonic ribs In contrast a distinct regulatory region activated expression following rib fracture in adult animals The same injury control region triggered gene expression in mesenchymal cells following tibia fracture in migrating keratinocytes following dorsal skin wounding and in regenerating epithelial cells following lung injury The Bmp5 gene thus contains an injury response control

hypothesis that changes often underlie morphological evolution However because most of these studies focus on evolved loss of traits the genetic architecture and possible association with changes of gain traits are less understood Here we show that a derived benthic freshwater stickleback population has evolved an approximate twofold gain in ventral pharyngeal tooth number compared with their ancestral marine counterparts Comparing developmental time courses of a marine population and this benthic population reveals that increases in tooth number and tooth plate area and decreases in tooth

Marchinko Conte Kabir Bedford Bergek Chan Jones Kingsley Peichel Schluter 2014 511 7509 Abstract Ecological differences often evolve early in speciation as divergent natural selection drives adaptation to distinct ecological niches leading ultimately to reproductive isolation Although this process is a major generator of biodiversity its genetic basis is still poorly understood Here we investigate the genetic architecture of niche differentiation in a sympatric species pair of threespine stickleback fish by mapping the effects of phenotypic traits on hybrid feeding and performance under conditions We show that multiple unlinked loci act largely additively to determine position along the major niche axis separating these recently diverged species We also find that functional mismatch between phenotypic traits reduces the growth of some stickleback hybrids beyond that expected from an intermediate phenotype suggesting a role for epistasis between the underlying genes This functional mismatch might lead to hybrid incompatibilities that are analogous to those underlying intrinsic reproductive isolation but depend on the ecological context View details for DOI View

Summers Jones Brady Kingsley 2014 4 Abstract Armor plate changes in sticklebacks are a classic example of repeated adaptive evolution Previous studies identified ectodysplasin EDA gene as the major locus controlling recurrent plate loss in freshwater fish though the causative DNA alterations were not known Here we show that freshwater EDA alleles have regulatory changes that reduce expression in developing plates and spines An identical T G base pair change is found in EDA enhancers of divergent fish Recreation of the T G change in a marine enhancer strongly reduces expression in posterior armor plates Bead implantation and cell culture experiments show that Wnt signaling strongly activates the marine EDA enhancer and the freshwater T G change reduces Wnt responsiveness Thus parallel evolution of sticklebacks has occurred through a shared DNA regulatory change which reduces the sensitivity of an EDA enhancer to Wnt signaling and alters expression in developing armor plates while preserving expression in other tissues View details for DOI View details for PubMedID 25629660 Phylogeography and adaptation genetics of stickleback from the Haida Gwaii archipelago revealed using

evolution and the underlying genetics In lakes on the Haida Gwaii archipelago off western Canada stickleback have undergone a remarkable local radiation and show phenotypic diversity matching that seen throughout the species distribution To provide a historical context for this radiation we surveyed genetic variation at 1000 single nucleotide polymorphism SNP loci in stickleback from over 100 populations SNPs included markers evenly distributed throughout genome and candidate SNPs tagging adaptive genomic regions Based on evenly distributed SNPs the phylogeographic pattern differs substantially from the disjunct pattern previously observed between two highly divergent mtDNA lineages The SNP tree instead shows extensive within watershed population clustering and different watersheds separated by short branches deep in the tree These data are consistent with separate colonizations of most watersheds despite underlying genetic connections between some independent drainages This supports previous suppositions that morphological diversity observed between watersheds has been shaped independently with populations exhibiting complete loss of lateral plates and giant size each occurring in several distinct clades Throughout the archipelago we see repeated selection of SNPs tagging candidate freshwater adaptive variants at several genomic regions differentiated between populations on a global scale EDA ATPase In estuarine sites both marine and freshwater allelic variants were commonly detected We also found typically marine alleles present in a few freshwater lakes especially those with completely plated morphology These results provide a general model for postglacial colonization of freshwater habitat by sticklebacks and illustrate the

Kingsley Menke B 2013 374 1 Abstract Extensive functional analyses have demonstrated that the pituitary homeodomain transcription factor Pitx1 plays a critical role in specifying hindlimb morphology in vertebrates However much less is known regarding the target genes and elements through which Pitx1 acts Earlier studies suggested that the hindlimb transcription factors Tbx4 HoxC10 and HoxC11 might be transcriptional targets of Pitx1 but definitive evidence for direct regulatory interactions has been lacking Using on embryonic mouse hindlimbs we have pinpointed the location of Pitx1 binding sites during mouse hindlimb development and identified potential gene targets for Pitx1 We determined that Pitx1 binding is significantly enriched near genes involved in limb morphogenesis including Tbx4 HoxC10 and HoxC11 Notably Pitx1 is bound to the previously identified HLEA and HLEB hindlimb enhancers of the Tbx4 gene and to a newly identified Tbx2 hindlimb enhancer Moreover Pitx1 binding is significantly enriched on hindlimb relative to features that are differentially marked by H3K27ac However our analysis revealed that Pitx1 also strongly associates with many functionally verified limb enhancers that exhibit similar levels of activity in the embryonic mesenchyme of forelimbs and hindlimbs We speculate that Pitx1 influences hindlimb morphology both through the activation of enhancers as well as through the modulation of enhancers that are active in both sets of limbs View details for DOI View details for Web of Science ID 000314145300021 View details for

sensory systems have evolved remarkable diversity but little is known about the underlying genetic mechanisms The lateral line sensory system of aquatic vertebrates is a promising model for genetic investigations of sensory evolution because there is extensive variation within and between species and this variation is easily quantified In the present study we compare the lateral line sensory system of threespine sticklebacks Gasterosteus aculeatus from an ancestral marine and a derived benthic lake population We show that individuals from these populations display differences in sensory neuromast number neuromast patterning and groove morphology Using genetic linkage mapping we identify regions of the genome that influence different aspects of lateral line morphology Distinct loci independently affect neuromast number on different body regions suggesting that a modular genetic structure underlies the evolution of peripheral receptor number in this sensory system Pleiotropy tight linkage are also important as we identify a region on linkage group 21 that affects multiple aspects of lateral line morphology Finally we detect epistasis between a locus on linkage group 4 and a locus on linkage group 21 interactions between these loci contribute to variation in neuromast pattern Our results reveal a complex genetic architecture underlying the evolution of the stickleback lateral line sensory system This study further uncovers a genetic relationship between sensory morphology and traits bony lateral plates creating an opportunity to investigate morphological

PEAK SHIFT IN THREESPINE STICKLEBACK EVOLUTION Rogers Tamkee Summers Balabahadra Marks Kingsley Schluter 2012 66 8 Abstract Transition of an evolving population to a new adaptive optimum is predicted to leave a signature in the distribution of effect sizes of fixed mutations If they affect many traits are pleiotropic large effect mutations should contribute more when a population evolves to a farther adaptive peak than to a nearer peak We tested this prediction in wild threespine stickleback fish Gasterosteus aculeatus by comparing the estimated frequency of large effect genetic changes underlying evolution as the same ancestor adapted to two lake types since the end of the ice age A higher frequency of large effect genetic changes quantitative trait loci contributed to adaptive evolution in populations that adapted to lakes representing a more distant optimum than to lakes in which the optimum phenotype was nearer to the ancestral state Our results also indicate that pleiotropy not just optimum overshoot contributes to this difference These results suggest that a series of adaptive improvements to a new environment leaves a detectable mark in the genome of wild populations Although not all assumptions of the theory are likely met in natural systems the prediction may be robust enough to the complexities of natural environments to be useful when forecasting

are important for a range of functions including camouflage and communication Repeating pigment patterns such as stripes bars and spots have been of particular interest to developmental and theoretical biologists but the genetic basis of natural variation in such patterns is largely unexplored In this study we identify a difference in a periodic pigment pattern among juvenile threespine sticklebacks Gasterosteus aculeatus from different environments Freshwater sticklebacks exhibit prominent vertical bars that visually break up the body shape but sticklebacks from marine populations do not We hypothesize that these distinct pigment patterns are tuned to provide crypsis in different habitats This phenotypic difference is widespread and appears in most of the freshwater populations that we sampled We used quantitative trait locus QTL mapping in F2 hybrids to elucidate the genetic architecture underlying divergence in this pigmentation pattern We identified two QTL that were significantly associated with variation in barring Interestingly these QTL were associated with two distinct aspects of the pigment pattern melanophore number and overall pigment level We compared the QTL locations with positions of known pigment candidate genes in the stickleback genome We also identified two major QTL for juvenile body size providing new insights into the genetic basis of juvenile growth rates in natural populations In summary although there is a growing literature describing simple genetic bases for adaptive coloration differences this study emphasizes that pigment

both turnover and speciation Although closely related species often have different systems it is unknown whether turnover contributes to the evolution of reproductive isolation between species Here we

member of a sympatric species pair in Japan We then performed genetic linkage mapping of traits important for reproductive isolation between the Japanese species pair The chromosome contains loci for male courtship display traits that contribute to behavioural isolation whereas the ancestral X chromosome contains loci for both behavioural isolation and hybrid male sterility Our work not only

Bell Kingsley 2009 19 13 Abstract The history of life offers plentiful examples of convergent evolution the independent derivation of similar phenotypes in distinct lineages The emergence of convergent phenotypes among closely related lineages frequently termed parallel evolution is often assumed to result from changes in similar genes or developmental pathways but the genetic origins of convergence remains poorly understood Ninespine Pungitius pungitius and threespine Gasterosteus aculeatus stickleback fish provide many examples of convergent evolution of adaptive phenotypes both within and between genera The genetic architecture of several important traits is now known for threespine sticklebacks thus ninespine sticklebacks provide a unique opportunity to critically test whether similar or different chromosome regions control similar phenotypes in these lineages We have generated the first linkage map for ninespine sticklebacks and used quantitative trait locus mapping to identify chromosome regions controlling several skeletal traits and sex determination In ninespine sticklebacks these traits mapped to chromosome regions not previously known to control the corresponding traits in threespine sticklebacks Therefore convergent morphological evolution in these related but independent vertebrate lineages might have different genetic origins Comparative

blueprints for individual cartilage and bony structures must somehow be encoded in the genome we currently know little about the detailed genomic mechanisms that direct precise growth patterns for particular bones We have carried out enhancer surveys to identify the regulatory architecture controlling developmental expression of the mouse Bmp5 gene which encodes a secreted signaling molecule required for normal morphology of specific skeletal features Although Bmp5 is expressed in many skeletal precursors different enhancers control expression in individual bones Remarkably we show here that different enhancers also exist for highly restricted spatial subdomains along the surface of individual skeletal structures including ribs and nasal cartilages Transgenic null and regulatory mutations confirm that these sequences are sufficient to trigger local changes in skeletal morphology and are required for establishing normal growth rates on separate bone surfaces Our findings suggest that individual bones are composite structures whose detailed growth patterns are built from many smaller lineage and gene expression domains Individual enhancers in BMP genes provide a genomic mechanism for controlling precise growth domains in particular cartilages and bones making it possible to separately regulate skeletal anatomy at highly specific locations in the body View

known about how its highly conserved expression patterns are generated We have used comparative genomics and functional scanning in transgenic mice to identify a dispersed group of enhancers controlling Tbx4 expression in different tissues Two independent enhancers control hindlimb expression one located upstream and one downstream of the Tbx4 coding exons These two enhancers hindlimb enhancer A and hindlimb enhancer B HLEA and HLEB differ in their primary sequence in their precise patterns of activity within the hindlimb and in their degree of sequence conservation across animals HLEB is highly conserved from fish to mammals Although Tbx4 expression and hindlimb development occur at different axial levels in fish and mammals HLEB cloned from either fish or mouse is capable of driving expression at the appropriate position of hindlimb development in mouse embryos HLEA is highly conserved only in mammals Deletion of HLEA from the endogenous mouse locus reduces expression of Tbx4 in the hindlimb during embryogenesis bypasses the embryonic lethality of mutations and produces viable fertile mice with characteristic changes in the size of bones in the hindlimb but not the

hundred years ago Wolff originally observed that bone growth and remodeling are exquisitely sensitive to mechanical forces acting on the skeleton Clinical studies have noted that the size and the strength of bone increase with weight bearing and muscular activity and decrease with bed rest and disuse Although the processes of mechanotransduction and functional response of bone to mechanical strain have been extensively studied the molecular signaling mechanisms that mediate the response of bone cells to mechanical stimulation remain we identify a novel germline mutation at the mouse Bone morphogenetic protein 5 Bmp5 locus Genetic analysis shows that the mutation occurs at a site encoding the proteolytic processing sequence of the BMP5 protein and blocks proper processing of BMP5 Anatomic studies reveal that this mutation affects the formation of multiple skeletal features including several skeletal sites in vivo Biomechanical studies of osteoblasts from these anatomic sites show that the mutation inhibits the proper response of bone cells to mechanical results from these genetic biochemical and biomechanical studies suggest that BMPs are required not only for skeletal

roles and fate of progenitor cells forming synovial joints during limb skeletogenesis remain largely unclear Here we produced prenatal and postnatal genetic cell by mating mice with mice expressing at prospective joint sites under the control of Gdf5 regulatory sequences cells initially constituted the interzone a compact mesenchymal structure representing the first overt sign of joint formation and displayed a distribution along the axis The cells expressed genes such as Wnt9a Erg and collagen IIA remained predominant in the sites over time gave rise to articular cartilage synovial lining and other joint tissues but contributed little if any to underlying growth plate cartilage and shaft To study their developmental properties more directly we isolated the cells from prospective autopod joint sites using a novel microsurgical procedure and tested them in vitro The cells displayed a propensity to undergo chondrogenesis that was enhanced by treatment with exogenous rGdf5 but blocked by Wnt9a To test roles for such capacity in vivo we created conditional mutants deficient in signaling using or Synovial joints did form in both mutants however the joints displayed a defective flat cell layer normally abutting the synovial cavity and expressed markedly reduced levels of lubricin In sum our data indicate that cells present at prospective joint sites and expressing Gdf5 constitute a distinct cohort of progenitor cells responsible for limb joint formation The cells appear to be patterned along specific limb symmetry axes and rely on local signaling tools to make

allele reduces expression in gill and skin tissue and is shared by multiple derived freshwater populations with reduced pigmentation In humans Europeans and East Asians also share derived alleles at the KITLG locus Strong signatures of selection map to regulatory regions surrounding the gene and admixture mapping shows that the KITLG genomic region has a significant effect on human skin color These experiments suggest that regulatory changes in Kitlg contribute to natural variation in vertebrate pigmentation and that similar genetic mechanisms may underlie rapid evolutionary change in fish and humans View details for DOI View details for Web of Science ID 000252217100024 View details for PubMedID 18083106 View details for PubMedCentralID PMC2900316 of BMP4 and BMP5 in a child with axial

Many traits evolve in parallel in widely separated populations The evolutionary radiation of threespine sticklebacks provides a powerful model for testing the molecular basis of parallel evolution in vertebrates Although marine sticklebacks are completely covered with bony armor plates most freshwater populations have dramatic reductions in plates Recent genetic studies have shown that major changes in armor patterning are likely due to regulatory alterations in the gene encoding the secreted signaling molecule ectodysplasin EDA In mammals mutations in many different components of the pathway produce similar changes in hair teeth sweat glands and dermal bones To test whether other genes in the EDA pathway also control natural variation in armor plates we identified and mapped stickleback EDA Receptor EDAR the Death Domain adaptor Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor TNFR SuperFamily member 19 its adaptor Factor 6 and the downstream regulator nuclear factor kappa B Essential Modulator NEMO In contrast to the diversity of genes underlying ectodermal dysplasia disease phenotypes in humans none of these EDA pathway components map to chromosomes previously shown to modify armor plates in natural populations though EDAR showed a small but significant effect on plate number We further investigated whether these genes exhibit differences in copy number target size or genomic organization that might make them less suitable targets for evolutionary change In comparison with EDA all these genes have smaller surrounding noncoding putative regulatory regions with fewer evolutionarily conserved regions We suggest that the presence of highly modular control sequences may be a key factor influencing the likelihood that particular genes will serve as the basis of major

signaling 2nd Conference on Skeletal Biology and Medicine Koyama Ochiai Rountree Kingsley Iwamoto Pacifici BLACKWELL PUBLISHING 2007 Abstract Indian hedgehog Ihh has been previously found to regulate synovial joint formation To analyze mechanisms we carried out morphological molecular and cell fate map analyses of interzone and joint development in and Ihh mouse embryo long bones We found that Ihh cartilaginous digit anlagen remained fused and lacked interzones or mature joints whereas wrist skeletal elements were not fused but their joints were morphologically abnormal and digit and ankle prospective joints expressed hedgehog target genes including Gli1 and Gli2 and genes including Gdf5 Erg and but expression of all these genes was barely detectable in mutant joints For cell fate map analysis of joint progenitor cells we mated R26R double transgenic mice with heterozygous Ihh mice and monitored reporter activity and gene expression in progeny In control limbs cells were present in developing interzones articulating layers and synovial lining tissue and absent from underlying growth plates In mutant specimens cells were present also However the cells were mostly located around the prospective and uninterrupted digit joint sites and interestingly still expressed Erg and Gdf5 Topographical analysis revealed that interzone and associated cells were not uniformly distributed but were much more numerous ventrally A similar topographical bias was seen for cavitation process and capsule primordia formation In sum Ihh is a critical and possibly direct regulator of joint development In its absence distribution and function of cells are abnormal but their patterning at prospective joint sites still occurs The functions of the cells appear to normally involve a previously unsuspected asymmetric distribution along the plane of the developing joint View details for DOI View details for Web of Science ID 000251898900007 View details for PubMedID 18083924 Biochemical and genetic analysis of ANK in arthritis and bone disease AMERICAN JOURNAL OF HUMAN GENETICS Gurley Reimer Kingsley 2006 79 6 Abstract Mutations in the progressive ankylosis gene cause surprisingly different skeletal phenotypes in mice and humans In mice recessive mutations cause arthritis ectopic crystal formation and joint fusion throughout the body In humans some dominant mutations cause chondrocalcinosis an disease characterized by the deposition of ectopic joint crystals Other dominant mutations cause craniometaphyseal dysplasia a childhood disease characterized by sclerosis of the skull and abnormal modeling of the long bones with little or no joint pathology Ank encodes a transmembrane protein that regulates pyrophosphate levels inside and outside tissue culture cells in vitro but its mechanism of action is not yet clear and conflicting models have been proposed to explain the effects of the human mutations Here we test and mutant forms of ANK for radiolabeled activity in frog oocytes We also reconstruct two human mutations in a bacterial artificial chromosome and test them in transgenic mice for rescue of the Ank null phenotype and for induction of new skeletal phenotypes ANK stimulates saturable transport of pyrophosphate ions across the plasma membrane with half maximal rates attained at physiological levels of pyrophosphate Chondrocalcinosis mutations retain apparently transport activity and can rescue the phenotype of Ank null mice Craniometaphyseal dysplasia mutations do not transport pyrophosphate and can not rescue the defects of Ank null mice Furthermore microcomputed tomography revealed previously unappreciated phenotypes in Ank null mice that are reminiscent of craniometaphyseal dysplasia The combination of biochemical and genetic analyses presented here provides insight into how mutations in ANKH cause human skeletal disease View details for Web of Science ID 000242131600003 View details for PubMedID

longstanding interest in parallel evolution little is known about the genes that control similar traits in different lineages of vertebrates Pelvic reduction in stickleback fish family Gasterosteidae provides a striking example of parallel evolution in a genetically tractable system Previous studies suggest that regulatory changes at the Pitx1 locus control pelvic reduction in a population of threespine sticklebacks Gasterosteus aculeatus In this study progeny from intergeneric crosses between threespine and ninespine Pungitius pungitius sticklebacks also showed severe pelvic reduction implicating a similar genetic origin for this trait in both genera Comparative sequencing studies in complete and Pungitius revealed no differences in the Pitx1 coding sequences but Pitx1 expression was absent from the prospective pelvic region of larvae from parents A much more phylogenetically distant example of pelvic reduction loss of hindlimbs in manatees shows a similar size bias that is a morphological signature of pelvic reduction in both sticklebacks and mice These multiple lines of evidence suggest that changes in Pitx1 may represent a key mechanism of morphological evolution in multiple populations species and genera of sticklebacks as well as in distantly related vertebrate lineages View details for DOI View details for Web of Science ID 000240648300038 View details for

widespread joint mineralization similar in severity to animals harboring the original ank allele A delayed yet similar phenotype was observed in mice with loss of ANK ANK pyrophosphate regulator was originally identified and proposed to play a key role in articular cartilage maintenance based on a single spontaneous mouse mutation ank that causes severe generalized arthritis A number of human mutations have subsequently been reported in the human ortholog ANKH some of which produce skull and long bone defects with no apparent defects in joints or articular cartilage None of the currently known mouse or human mutations clearly eliminate the function of the endogenous new Ank alleles were generated using homologous recombination in mouse embryonic stem ES cells Joint range of motion assays and muCT studies were used to quantitatively assess phenotypic severity in wildtype heterozygous and homozygous mice carrying either the null Anknull or original Ankank allele A expressing line was crossed to mice harboring the conditional Ankfloxp allele to eliminate ANK function specifically in the joints Histological stains and LACZ activity were used to determine the correlation between local loss of ANK function and defective joint mice develop severe ectopic postnatal crystal deposition in almost every joint of the body leading to eventual joint fusion and loss of mobility The severity of phenotype in these mice is indistinguishable from that of mice In addition despite the widespread expression of Ank in many tissues the specific deletion of Ank in joints also produces joint mineralization and studies show that ANK function is required locally in joints to inhibit mineral formation and that the Ank gene plays a key role in postnatal maintenance of joint mobility and

regions and can reveal potential regulatory sequences The GDF6 gene controls developmental patterning of skeletal joints and is associated with numerous distant regulatory elements Using sequence data from 14 vertebrate species we performed novel multispecies comparative analyses to detect highly conserved sequences flanking GDF6 The complementary tools WebMCS and ExactPlus identified a series of multispecies conserved sequences MCSs Of particular interest are MCSs within noncoding regions previously shown to contain GDF6 regulatory elements A previously reported conserved sequence at kb was also detected by both WebMCS and ExactPlus Analysis of transgenic mice revealed that a segment from this region contains an enhancer for Gdf6 expression in developing proximal limb joints Several other MCSs represent candidate GDF6 regulatory elements many of these are not conserved in fish or frog but are strongly conserved in mammals View details for DOI View details for Web of Science ID

Schoor Chen Marks Harley Mishina Kingsley 2004 2 11 Abstract Articular cartilage plays an essential role in health and mobility but is frequently damaged or lost in millions of people that develop arthritis The molecular mechanisms that create and maintain this thin layer of cartilage that covers the surface of bones in joint regions are poorly understood in part because tools to manipulate gene expression specifically in this tissue have not been available Here we use regulatory information from the mouse Gdf5 gene a bone morphogenetic protein BMP family member to develop new mouse lines that can be used to either activate or inactivate genes specifically in developing joints Expression of Cre recombinase from Gdf5 bacterial artificial chromosome clones leads to specific activation or inactivation of floxed target genes in developing joints including early joint interzones adult articular cartilage and the joint capsule We have used this system to test the role of BMP receptor signaling in joint development Mice with null mutations in Bmpr1a are known to die early in embryogenesis with multiple defects However combining a floxed Bmpr1a allele with the driver bypasses this embryonic lethality and leads to birth and postnatal development of mice missing the Bmpr1a gene in articular regions Most joints in the body form normally in the absence of Bmpr1a receptor function However articular cartilage within the joints gradually wears away in mice after birth in a process resembling human osteoarthritis mice provide a general system that can be used to test the role of genes in articular regions BMP receptor signaling is required not only for early development and creation of multiple tissues but also for ongoing maintenance of articular cartilage

pathways can evolve very rapidly Previous cytological studies suggest that recently diverged species of stickleback fish have different sex chromosome complements Here we investigate the genetic and chromosomal mechanisms that underlie sex determination in the threespine stickleback Gasterosteus aculeatus linkage mapping identifies a single chromosome region at the distal end of linkage group LG 19 which controls male or female sexual development in threespine sticklebacks Although sex chromosomes are not cytogenetically visible in this species several lines of evidence suggest that LG 19 is an evolving sex chromosome system similar to the XX male system in many other species 1 males are consistently heterozygous for unique alleles in this region 2 recombination between loci linked to the region is reduced in male meiosis relative to female meiosis 3 sequence analysis of and bacterial artificial chromosome BAC clones from the region reveals many sequence differences between the and

ecologically important traits Demonstrations of speciation or assortative mating by selective environment link ecology and isolation but the phenotypic traits mediating isolation have not been confirmed Here we show that the parallel of mating incompatibilities between stickleback populations can be largely accounted for by assortative mating based on one trait body size which evolves predictably according to environment In addition to documenting the influence of body size on reproductive isolation for stickleback populations spread across the Northern Hemisphere we have confirmed

new traits in natural populations Are the same genetic changes seen in cases of parallel evolution Despite interest in these questions they have been difficult to address particularly in vertebrates We have analyzed the genetic basis of natural variation in three different aspects of the skeletal armor of threespine sticklebacks Gasterosteus aculeatus the pattern number and size of the bony lateral plates A few chromosomal regions can account for variation in all three aspects of the lateral plates with one major locus contributing to most of the variation in lateral plate pattern and number Genetic mapping and allelic complementation experiments show that the same major locus is responsible for the parallel evolution of armor plate reduction in two widely separated populations

be identified by simple inspection of primary DNA sequence information Here we describe an efficient method of surveying large genomic regions for gene regulatory information and subdividing complex sets of distant regulatory elements into smaller intervals for detailed study The mouse Gdf6 gene is expressed in a number of distinct embryonic locations that are involved in the patterning of skeletal and soft tissues To identify sequences responsible for Gdf6 regulation we first isolated a series of overlapping bacterial artificial chromosomes BACs that extend varying distances upstream and downstream of the gene A LacZ reporter cassette was integrated into the Gdf6 transcription unit of each BAC using homologous recombination in bacteria Each modified BAC was injected into fertilized mouse eggs and founder transgenic embryos were analyzed for LacZ expression The overlapping segments defined by the BAC clones revealed five separate regulatory regions that drive LacZ expression in 11 distinct anatomical locations To further localize sequences that control expression in developing skeletal joints we created a series of BAC constructs with precise deletions across a putative region This approach further narrowed the critical control region to an area containing several stretches of sequence that are highly conserved between mice and humans A distant fragment containing the highly conserved regions is able to direct very specific expression of a minimal reporter in proximal limb joints These results demonstrate that even distant complex regulatory

BIOLOGY Settle Rountree Sinha Thacker Higgins KINGSLEY 2003 254 1 Abstract factors 5 6 and 7 represent a distinct subgroup within the bone morphogenetic protein BMP family of secreted signaling molecules Previous studies have shown that the Gdf5 gene is expressed in transverse stripes across developing skeletal elements and is one of the earliest known markers of joint formation during embryonic development Although null mutations in this gene disrupt formation of some bones and joints in the skeleton many sites are unaffected Here we show that the closely related family members Gdf6 and Gdf7 are expressed in different subsets of developing joints Inactivation of the Gdf6 gene causes defects in joint ligament and cartilage formation at sites distinct from those seen in Gdf5 mutants including the wrist and ankle the middle ear and the coronal suture between bones in the skull Mice lacking both Gdf5 and Gdf6 show additional defects including severe reduction or loss of some skeletal elements in the limb additional fusions between skeletal structures scoliosis and altered cartilage in the intervertebral joints of the spinal column These results show that members of the subgroup are required for normal formation of bones and joints in the limbs skull and axial skeleton The diverse effects on joint development and the different types of joints affected in the mutants suggest that members of the GDF family play a key role in establishing boundaries between many different skeletal elements during normal development Some of the skeletal defects seen in single or double mutant mice resemble defects seen in human skeletal diseases which suggests that these genes may be candidates that underlie some forms of coalition conductive deafness scoliosis and

were occurring in the periodontium as well Surprisingly results indicated the absence of ankylosis however a marked increase in cementum formation on the root surfaces of fully developed teeth of these mutant mice was noted Examination of ank mutant mice at earlier ages of tooth root formation indicated that this striking observation is apparent from the onset of cementogenesis These findings

et al 1995 Hughes et al 1995 Andrew et al 1999 Here we show that two previously described families with CCAL2 have mutations in the human homolog of the mouse progressive ankylosis gene ANKH One of the human mutations results in the substitution of a highly conserved amino acid residue within a predicted transmembrane segment The other creates a new ATG start site that adds four additional residues to the ANKH protein Both mutations segregate completely with disease status and are not found in control subjects In addition 1 of 95 patients with sporadic CC showed a deletion of a single codon in the ANKH gene The same change was found in a sister who had bilateral knee replacement for osteoarthritis Each of the three human mutations was reconstructed in a ANK expression construct previously shown to regulate pyrophosphate levels in cultured cells in vitro All three of the human mutations showed significantly more activity than a previously described nonsense mutation that causes severe hydroxyapatite mineral deposition and widespread joint ankylosis in mice These results suggest that small sequence changes in ANKH are one cause of CC and joint disease in humans Increased ANK activity may explain the different types of crystals commonly deposited in human CCAL2 families and mutant mice and may provide a useful pharmacological target for treating some forms of human CC View details for Web of Science ID 000178613800019 View details for PubMedID 12297987 View details for PubMedCentralID PMC378546 Dysregulated expression of BMP5 in a patient with deformed

entirely within the small critical intervals recently defined for both the mouse and human mutations and is misexpressed at the exact time that the mouse Hx phenotype becomes apparent during limb

arise from mutations and not from haploinsufficiency Furthermore we created a mutation in the mouse Lmbr1 gene that causes digit number reduction oligodactyly on its own and in trans to a deletion chromosome The loss of digits that we observed in mice with reduced Lmbr1 activity is in contrast to the gain of digits observed in Hx mice and human polydactyly patients Our results suggest that the

of mesenchymal cells during embryonic development Recent genetic and developmental studies have identified some of the genes that play an important role in controlling both the aggregation of mesenchymal cells into rough outlines of future skeletal elements condensations and in controlling where skeletal precursors cleave or segment to produce separate skeletal elements connected by joints Members of the bone morphogenetic protein BMP family appear to play an important role in both processes Mouse and human mutations in these genes lead to defects in formation of specific bones and joints with striking specificity for particular anatomical locations Results from a range of experiments suggest that these molecules may have multiple functions during normal skeletal development and patterning A major challenge for the future is to identify genes and pathways that can maintain repair or stimulate the regeneration of bone and joint structures at later developmental stages View

mutation maps to a homologous chromosome segment and has been proposed to affect a homologous gene To understand the molecular changes underlying PPD we used a positional cloning approach to identify

distal to the Shh locus The nonrecombinant interval was completely cloned in bacterial artificial chromosomes and searched for genes using a combination of exon trapping sample sequencing and mapping

Lmbr1 gene is dramatically altered in developing limbs of Hx mutant mice The correspondence between the spatial and temporal changes in Lmbr1 expression and the embryonic onset of the Hx mutant

rapidly survey hundreds of kilobases of DNA for potential regulatory sequences surrounding the mouse bone morphogenetic Bmp5 gene Simple coinjection of large insert clones with lacZ reporter constructs recapitulates all of the sites of expression observed previously with numerous small constructs covering a large complex regulatory region The coinjection approach has made it possible to rapidly survey other regions of the Bmp5 gene for potential control elements to confirm the location of several elements predicted from previous expression studies using regulatory mutations at the Bmp5 locus to test whether Bmp5 control regions act similarly on endogenous and foreign promoters and to show that Bmp5 control elements are capable of rescuing phenotypic effects of a Bmp5 deficiency This rapid approach has identified new Bmp5 control regions responsible for controlling the development of specific anatomical structures in the vertebrate skeleton A similar approach may be useful for studying complex control regions surrounding many other genes important in embryonic development and human disease View details for Web of Science ID 000085409600060 View details for PubMedID 10677507 GDF5 coordinates bone and joint formation during digit development DEVELOPMENTAL BIOLOGY Storm KINGSLEY 1999 209 1 Abstract A functional skeletal system requires the coordinated development of many different tissue types including cartilage bones joints and tendons Members of the Bone morphogenetic protein BMP family of secreted signaling molecules have been implicated as endogenous regulators of skeletal development This is based on their expression during bone and joint formation their ability to induce ectopic bone and cartilage and the skeletal abnormalities present in animals with mutations in BMP family members One member of this family factor 5 GDF5 is encoded by the mouse brachypodism locus Mice with mutations in this gene show reductions in the length of bones in the limbs altered formation of bones and joints in the sternum and a reduction in the number of bones in the digits The expression pattern of Gdf5 during normal development and the phenotypes seen in mice with single or double mutations in Gdf5 and Bmp5 suggested that Gdf5 has multiple functions in skeletogenesis including roles in joint and cartilage development To further understand the function of GDF5 in skeletal development we assayed the response of developing chick and mouse limbs to recombinant GDF5 protein The results from these assays coupled with an analysis of the development of brachypodism digits indicate that GDF5 is necessary and sufficient for both cartilage development and the restriction of joint formation to the appropriate location Thus GDF5 function in the digits demonstrates a link between cartilage development and joint development and is an important determinant of the pattern of bones and articulations in the digits View details for Web of

Russell Kingsley 1998 148 1 Abstract Bone morphogenetic proteins BMPs are secreted signaling molecules that control important developmental events in many different organisms Previous studies have shown that BMPs are expressed at the earliest stages of skeletal development and are required for formation of specific skeletal features strongly suggesting that they are endogenous signals used to control formation of skeletal tissue Despite the importance of BMP signaling in normal development very little is known about the mechanisms that control the synthesis and distribution of BMP signals in vertebrates Here we identify a large array of control sequences that lay out expression of the mouse Bmp5 gene in specific skeletal structures and soft tissues Some of these elements show striking specificity for particular anatomical features within the skeleton rather than for cartilage and bone in general These data suggest that the vertebrate skeleton is built from the sum of many independent domains of BMP expression each of which may be controlled by separate regulatory elements driving expression at specific anatomical locations Surprisingly some of the regulatory sequences in the Bmp5 gene map over 270 kb from the Bmp5 promoter making them among the most distant elements yet identified in studies of eukaryotic gene expression View details for Web of Science ID

years of mutagenesis experiments using the mouse test have produced a large number of induced germline mutations at seven loci among them the short ear locus We have previously shown that the short ear locus encodes bone morphogenetic protein 5 BMP5 a member of a large family of secreted signaling molecules that play key roles in axis formation tissue differentiation mesenchymalepithelial interactions and skeletal development Here we examine 24 and mutations at the short ear locus Sequence changes in the Bmp5 open reading frame confirm the importance of cysteine residues in the

the bone morphogenetic protein BMP family DEVELOPMENT Storm KINGSLEY 1996 122 12 Abstract The mouse brachypodism locus encodes a bone morphogenetic protein BMP molecule called factor 5 GDF5 Here we show that Gdf5 transcripts are expressed in a striking pattern of transverse stripes within many skeletal precursors in the developing limb The number location and time of appearance of these stripes corresponds to the sites where joints will later form between skeletal elements Null mutations in Gdf5 disrupt the formation of more than 30 of the synovial joints in the limb leading to complete or partial fusions between particular skeletal elements and changes in the patterns of repeating structures in the digits wrists and ankles Mice carrying null mutations in both Gdf5 and another BMP family member Bmp5 show additional abnormalities not observed in either of the single mutants These defects include disruption of the sternebrae within the sternum and abnormal formation of the fibrocartilaginous joints between the sternebrae and ribs Previous studies have shown that members of the BMP family are required for normal development of cartilage and bone The current studies suggest that particular BMP family members may also play an essential role in the segmentation process that cleaves skeletal precursors into separate elements This process helps determine the number of elements in repeating series in both limbs and sternum and is required for normal generation of the functional articulations between many adjacent structures in the vertebrate skeleton View details

Abstract We examined the changes in femoral geometry and torsional strength in deficient mice over a time interval changes Four groups of female mice n 6 per group were examined animals and their heterozygous control littermates at 4 and 26 weeks of age In agreement with findings previously observed in a group of adult mice 26 weeks the femora of animals were significantly smaller in length and cross section at both ages The magnitudes of the differences between genotypes were comparable at each age indicating that the overall rates of appositional and endochondral growth were similar for both genotypes over the period In the adult animals femora were 27 7 weaker in torsional strength due to their smaller geometry However bone strength in adult mice appeared to be adequate for animal size No significant difference was detected in maximum femoral torque when normalized by body mass In old animals deficiency was associated with a 27 6 lower body mass but the torsional strength of the femur was not significantly different from that of controls geometry was smaller in old mice but the apparent bone material ultimate shear stress was elevated by 33 10 thereby resulting in a whole bone torsional strength equivalent to that of the larger control mice While the data suggest a higher material strength in the animals no significant difference in the level of bone mineralization was detectable between genotypes at either age View details for Web of Science ID A1996UT99700017 View details for PubMedID 8806002 The role of BMPs and GDFs in development of

Chromosome 2 by interspecific backcross mapping The map location suggests close linkage to classical mouse mutations and places Bmp7 within a chromosome region thought to contain one or more unidentified imprinted genes A direct test suggests that Bmp7 is not imprinted An examination of embryonic RNA expression patterns shows that Bmp7 is expressed in a variety of skeletal and nonskeletal tissues Both embryonic expression patterns and the human chromosomal sublocalization inferred from its mouse location make Bmp7 a candidate for the gene affected in some patients with syndrome View

morphogenetic proteins BMPs play a critical role in early skeletal development BMPs are also potential mediators of bone response to mechanical loading but their role in later stages of bone growth and adaptation has yet to be studied We characterized the postcranial skeletal defects in mature mice with BMP deficiency by measuring muscle mass and long bone geometric material and torsional mechanical properties The animals studied were short ear mice n 10 with a homozygous deletion of the gene and their heterozygous control litter mates n 15 effects which were found to be independent of genotype were also examined The femora of short ear mice were 3 shorter than in controls and had significantly lower values of many geometric and structural strength parameters p No significant differences in ash content or material properties were detected Lower femoral whole bone torsional strength was due to the smaller geometry 16 smaller section modulus in the short ear mice The diminished geometry may be commensurate with lower levels of in vivo loading as reflected by body mass and quadriceps mass While no significant gender differences were found in whole bone strength or geometry males had significantly greater body mass and quadriceps mass and lower ash content The data suggest that adult female mice have a more robust skeleton than males relative to in vivo mechanical demands Furthermore although the bones of short ear mice are smaller and weaker than in control animals they appear to be biomechanically appropriate for the in vivo mechanical loads that they experience View details for Web of Science ID A1995RB63900005 View details for PubMedID 7605705 BMP5 AND THE MOLECULAR SKELETAL AND ALTERATIONS IN SHORT EAR MICE DEVELOPMENTAL BIOLOGY King J Marker Seung KINGSLEY 1994 166 1 Abstract Mutations at the mouse short ear se locus alter the formation and repair of skeletal structures and the development of several soft tissues Most of the developmental effects of the gene have been studied using a spontaneous mutation reported over 70 years ago Here we show that this mutation consists of a nonsense mutation in a secreted signaling molecule called bone morphogenetic protein 5 BMP5 This small sequence alteration in combination with previously reported translocation and deletion mutations provides strong genetic evidence that BMP5 is the normal product of the se locus Transcripts from the Bmp5 gene are expressed at the earliest stages of normal skeletal development in patterns that closely resemble the shapes of forming skeletal elements The gene is also expressed at several sites of soft tissue abnormalities previously reported in se animals including lungs liver ureter bladder and intestines The combined genetic biochemical and expression data suggest that BMP5 is a key signal used to initiate formation of particular skeletal elements and is required for normal development of several soft tissues as well View

KINGSLEY Lee J 1994 368 6472 Abstract The mutation brachypodism bp alters the length and number of bones in the limbs of mice but spares the axial skeleton It illustrates the importance of specific genes in controlling the morphogenesis of individual skeletal elements in the tetrapod limb We now report the isolation of three new members of the transforming growth superfamily factors GDF and 7 and show by mapping expression patterns and sequencing that mutations in Gdf5 are responsible for skeletal alterations in bp mice GDF5 and the closely related GDF6 and GDF7 define a new subgroup of factors related to known and molecules the bone morphogenetic proteins BMPs Studies of Bmp5 mutations in short ear mice have shown that at least one other BMP gene is also required for normal skeletal development The highly specific skeletal alterations in bp and short ear mice suggest that different members of the BMP family control the formation of different morphological features in the

Russell Copeland Jenkins A 1992 71 3 Abstract The mouse short ear gene is required for normal growth and patterning of skeletal structures and for repair of bone fractures in adults We have carried out an extensive chromosome walk in the chromosome region that surrounds this locus Here we show that the short ear region contains the gene for a TGF protein called bone morphogenetic protein 5 This gene is deleted or rearranged in several independent mutations at the short ear locus Mice homozygous for large deletions of the coding region are viable and fertile Mutations at the short ear locus provide an important new tool for defining the normal functions of BMPs in mammals The specific skeletal defects seen in animals which occur against a background of otherwise normal skeletal structures suggest that particular aspects of skeletal morphology may be determined by individual members of a family of signaling factors that can induce the formation of cartilage and bone in vivo

initially identified from a cDNA clone of a rat brain messenger RNA expressed in particular subsets of CNS neurons and pituitary cells Although the protein encoded by this gene is of unknown function its sequence suggests that it may be related to secretogranin proteins which are found in association with secretory granules in a variety of peptidergic endocrine and neuronal cells Here we show that the mouse 1B1075 gene is located between the dilute d and short ear se genes on chromosome 9 Many different deletion mutations have previously been isolated in the genetic region that includes these genes By producing mice carrying two deletions that overlap at the 1B1075 locus the gene for this message can be completely eliminated from otherwise viable animals The animals missing the 1B1075 gene

compared to conventional genetic maps using six markers previously localized in laboratory mouse strains These markers included thymus cell cytochrome dilute transferrin cholecystokinin and the alpha inhibitory subunit No evidence was seen for segregation distortion chromosome rearrangements or altered genetic distances in the results from interspecific backcross mapping Regional map locations were determined for four genes that were previously assigned to chromosome 9 using somatic cell hybrids These genes were glutathione Ya subunit Gsta the T3 gamma subunit the low density lipoprotein receptor and the oncogene The map locations for these genes establish new regions of synteny between mouse chromosome 9 and human chromosomes 6 11 and 19 In addition the close linkage detected between

Abstract A rapidly reversible defect in protein exhibited by a line of mutant Chinese hamster ovary CHO cells was used to study the kinetics and function of of the low density lipoprotein LDL receptor The mutant line genotype LDLD can not synthesize under normal culture conditions and therefore can not add oligosaccharides to proteins The pools in LDLD cells can be filled rapidly when is added to the culture medium thus restoring normal synthesis of carbohydrates metabolic labeling experiments were used to show that i the first step in the of LDL receptors can occur posttranslationally ii after LDL receptors reach the cell surface they are not subject to subsequent sugar addition suggesting that they do not return to compartments in which takes place iii carbohydrate chains on the LDL receptor itself are required for normal stability and function and iv the instability of the LDL receptor is due to proteolytic cleavage and the release into the medium of the bulk of the extracellular domain of the receptor It appears that of the LDL receptor and several other cell surface glycoproteins permits stable expression by preventing proteolytic cleavage of the extracellular

Hobbie KINGSLEY Kozarsky Jackman Krieger 1987 235 4784 Abstract Exchange of small molecules between cells through intercellular junctions is a widespread phenomenon implicated in many physiological and developmental processes This type of intercellular communication can restore the activity of lipoprotein LDL receptors in mammalian cells that are deficient in the enzyme Pure cultures of the mutant are unable to synthesize normal carbohydrate chains on LDL receptors and many other glycoproteins and therefore do not express LDL receptor activity When these cells are cocultivated with cells expressing normal activity the structure and function of LDL receptors are restored to normal by the transfer of this enzyme products through intercellular junctions The formation of functional junctions does not require normal glycosylation of membrane proteins Because many convenient assays and selections for LDL receptor activity are available this mutant can provide a powerful new tool

DEFECTS IN THE SYNTHESIS OF AND CARBOHYDRATE CHAINS JOURNAL OF CELL BIOLOGY KINGSLEY Kozarsky Segal Krieger 1986 102 5 Abstract Biochemical immunological and genetic techniques were used to investigate the genetic defects in three types of low density lipoprotein LDL hamster cells The previously isolated ldlB ldlC and ldlD mutants all synthesized essentially normal amounts of a precursor form of the LDL receptor but were unable to process this receptor to the mature form of Instead these mutants produced abnormally small heterogeneous receptors that reached the cell surface but were rapidly degraded thereafter The abnormal sizes of the LDL receptors in these cells were due to defective processing of the LDL receptor and carbohydrate chains Processing defects in these cells appeared to be general since the ldlB ldlC and ldlD mutants also showed defective glycosylation of a viral glycoprotein alterations in glycolipid synthesis and changes in resistance to several toxic lectins Preliminary structural studies suggested that these cells had defects in multiple stages of the processing reactions responsible for synthesis of glycolipids and in the and carbohydrate chains of glycoproteins Comparisons between the ldl mutants and a large number of previously isolated CHO glycosylation defective mutants showed that the genetic defects in ldlB ldlC and ldlD cells were unique and that only very specific types of carbohydrate alteration could dramatically affect LDL receptor function View details for Web of Science ID A1986C223500005 View details for PubMedID 3700466 REVERSIBLE DEFECTS IN GLYCOSYLATION AND LDL RECEPTOR EXPRESSION IN A DEFICIENT MUTANT CELL KINGSLEY Kozarsky Hobbie Krieger 1986 44 5 Abstract We previously isolated an unusual hamster cell mutant ldlD that does not express LDL receptor activity unless it is cocultivated with other cells or grown in high concentrations of serum We now show that ldlD cells are deficient in the enzyme and GalNAc When ldlD cells are grown in media they can not synthesize enough and to allow normal synthesis of glycolipids and glycoproteins The deficiency accounts for all glycosylation defects previously observed in ldlD cells including production of abnormal LDL receptors All abnormal phenotypes of ldlD cells can be fully corrected by exogenous galactose and GalNAc The separate effects of these sugars on LDL receptor activity suggest that carbohydrate chains are crucial for receptor stability ldlD cells may be useful for structural and functional studies of many proteins proteoglycans and

mutants that are unable to bind and internalize low density lipoprotein LDL Pairwise cell fusions show that these LDL mutants fall into three recessive complementation groups ldlA ldlB and ldlC Complementation was detected by observing the uptake of fluorescent LDL and was quantitated by measuring the degradation of LDL by isolated hybrid cells Previous studies had defined a fourth recessive complementation group ldlD Complementation tests between CHO cells and human fibroblasts suggested that the defects in mutants of the ldlA complementation group are analogous to those in a patient with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia A revertant of an ldlA mutant was isolated and appeared to be heterozygous at the ldlA locus The phenotype of this revertant was similar to that of cells from patients with the heterozygous form of familial hypercholesterolemia Together with recent DNA transfection studies these results suggest that the ldlA locus is the structural gene for the LDL receptor in CHO cells Mutants in the ldlB ldlC and ldlD complementation groups must have defects in genes that are required for either the regulation synthesis transport recycling or turnover of LDL

ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF SCIENCES Krieger Martin Segal Kingsley 1983 80 18 Abstract This paper describes a rapid and efficient procedure for the isolation of mutant cells with defects in endocytosis The procedure takes advantage of two fungal metabolites compactin ML236B a potent inhibitor of cholesterol biosynthesis and amphotericin B a polyene antibiotic that forms toxic complexes with sterols in membranes Chinese hamster ovary cells were preincubated overnight in a medium containing mevalonate low density lipoprotein LDL and compactin At the end of the preincubation period cells were cholesterol replete while mutant cells that could not utilize the cholesterol in LDL were cholesterol deficient Subsequent incubation with amphotericin B for 6 hr killed most of the cells After a second round of B selection clones appeared at a frequency of approximately equal to X 10 Some of these clones expressed LDL phenotypes and fell into one of two previously defined classes of mutation Sensitivity of the mutants to infection by vesicular stomatitis virus suggested that the mutations do not disrupt the coated vesicle pathway of endocytosis Minor modifications in the B selection permit the isolation of cholesterol auxotrophs and might allow the isolation of mutations Because LDL can be coupled to ligands that bind to receptors other than the LDL receptor B selection may permit the isolation of mutant cells with defects that specifically disrupt other endocytic pathways View details for Web of Science ID A1983RH33500032 View details for PubMedID 6310583
