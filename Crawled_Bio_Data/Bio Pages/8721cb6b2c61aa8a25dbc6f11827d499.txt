Sequencing in Genomic Medicine and Public Health NSIGHT2 study was a randomized controlled trial of rapid sequencing rWGS or rapid sequencing rWES in infants with diseases of unknown etiology in intensive care units ICUs Gravely ill infants were not randomized and received sequencing urWGS Herein we report results of clinician surveys of the clinical utility of rapid genomic sequencing RGS The primary perception that RGS was was met for 154 77 of 201 infants Both positive and negative tests were rated as having clinical utility 42 of 45 93 and 112 of 156 72 respectively Physicians reported that RGS changed clinical management in 57 28 infants particularly in those receiving urWGS p and positive tests p Outcomes of 32 15 infants were perceived to be changed by RGS Positive tests changed outcomes more frequently than negative tests p In logistic regression models the likelihood that RGS was perceived as useful increased when associated with changes in management 95 CI Changes in management were more likely when results were positive 95 CI and turnaround time was shorter odds ratio 95 CI RGS seldom led to confusion or distress among families 6 of 207 3 In summary clinicians perceived high clinical utility and low likelihood of harm with RGS of infants in ICUs with diseases of unknown etiology RGS was perceived as beneficial irrespective of whether results were positive

neonatal pathogen However the cellular and molecular mechanisms for neonatal susceptibility to GBS pneumonia and sepsis are incompletely understood Here we optimized a mouse model of GBS pneumonia to test the role of alveolar macrophage ΑΜΦ maturation in host vulnerability to disease Compared with juvenile and adult mice neonatal mice infected with GBS had increased mortality and persistence of lung injury In addition neonatal mice were defective in GBS phagocytosis and killing ΑΜΦ depletion and disruption of ΑΜΦ differentiation in mice both impaired GBS clearance AMΦ engage the heavily sialylated GBS capsule via the cell surface Siglec receptors Sn and Although both newborn and adult ΑΜΦ expressed newborn ΑΜΦ expressed significantly lower levels of Sn We propose that a developmental

BIOLOGY Sahoo Zaramela Hernandez Mai Taheri Dang Stouch Medal McCoy Aschner Blackwell Zengler Prince 2020 3 1 259 Abstract Lung macrophages mature after birth placing newborn infants particularly those born preterm within a unique window of susceptibility to disease We hypothesized that in preterm infants lung macrophage immaturity contributes to the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia BPD the most common serious complication of prematurity By measuring changes in lung macrophage gene expression in preterm patients at risk of BPD we show here that patients eventually developing BPD had higher inflammatory mediator expression even on the first day of life Surprisingly the ex vivo response to LPS was similar across all samples Our analysis did however uncover macrophage signature genes whose expression increased in the first week of life specifically in patients resilient to disease We propose that these changes describe the dynamics of human lung macrophage differentiation

Sahoo 2020 11 275 Abstract Macrophages engulf and digest microbes cellular debris and various cells throughout the body Understanding the dynamics of macrophage gene expression is crucial for studying human diseases As both bulk RNAseq and single cell RNAseq datasets become more numerous and complex identifying a universal and reliable marker of macrophage cell becomes paramount Traditional approaches have relied upon tissue specific expression patterns To identify universal biomarkers of macrophage we used a previously published computational approach called BECC Boolean Equivalent Correlated Clusters that was originally used to identify conserved cell cycle genes We performed BECC analysis using the known macrophage marker CD14 as a seed gene The main idea behind BECC is that it uses massive database of public gene expression dataset to establish robust patterns identified using a combination of correlation linear regression and Boolean equivalences Our analysis identified and validated FCER1G and TYROBP as novel universal biomarkers for macrophages in human and mouse tissues View details for DOI View details for Web of Science ID 000529017900001 View details for

Romanoski Fonseca Prince Glass 2020 21 2 Abstract The lung is inhabited by resident alveolar and interstitial macrophages as well as monocytic cells that survey lung tissues Each cell type plays distinct functional roles under homeostatic and inflammatory conditions but mechanisms establishing their molecular identities and functional potential remain poorly understood In the present study systematic evaluation of transcriptomes and open chromatin of alveolar macrophages AMs interstitial macrophages IMs and lung monocytes from two mouse strains enabled inference of common and transcriptional regulators We provide evidence that these factors drive selection of regulatory landscapes that specify distinct phenotypes of AMs and IMs and entrain qualitatively different responses to receptor 4 signaling in vivo These studies reveal a striking divergence in a fundamental innate immune response pathway in AMs and establish a framework for further understanding macrophage

Speziale Suttner Van der Kraan Knight Sauer Song White Wise Yamada RCIGM Investigators 2019 105 4 Abstract The second Newborn Sequencing in Genomic Medicine and Public Health study was a randomized controlled trial of the effectiveness of rapid or sequencing rWGS or rWES respectively in seriously ill infants with diseases of unknown etiology Here we report comparisons of analytic and diagnostic performance Of ill inpatient infants 578 46 had diseases of unknown etiology 213 infants 37 of those eligible were enrolled within 96 h of admission 24 infants 11 were very ill and received sequencing urWGS The remaining infants were randomized 95 to rWES and 94 to rWGS The analytic performance of rWGS was superior to rWES including variants likely to affect protein function and ClinVar pathogenic variants p The diagnostic performance of rWGS and rWES were similar 18 diagnoses in 94 infants 19 versus 19 diagnoses in 95 infants 20 respectively as was time to result median versus days respectively However the proportion diagnosed by urWGS 11 of 24 46 was higher than p and time to result was less median days p The incremental diagnostic yield of reflexing to trio after negative proband analysis was 1 of 147 In conclusion rapid genomic sequencing can be performed as a diagnostic test in inpatient infants urWGS had the shortest time to result which was important in unstable infants and those in whom a genetic diagnosis was likely to impact immediate management Further comparison of urWGS and rWES is warranted because genomic technologies and knowledge of variant pathogenicity are evolving rapidly View details for DOI View details for Web of Science ID 000488953400004 View details for PubMedID 31564432 View details for PubMedCentralID PMC6817534 Differential Immune Activation in Fetal Macrophage Populations SCIENTIFIC REPORTS Lakhdari AsamiYamamura Hernandez Anderson Lund Hoffman Prince 2019 9 7677 Abstract Distinct macrophage subsets populate the developing embryo and fetus in distinct waves However little is known about the functional differences between in utero macrophage populations or how they might contribute to fetal and neonatal immunity Here we tested the innate immune response of mouse macrophages derived from the embryonic yolk sac and from fetal liver When isolated from liver or lung CD11bHI fetal liver derived macrophages responded to the TLR4 agonist LPS by expressing and releasing inflammatory cytokines However macrophages from the yolk sac did not respond to LPS treatment While differences in TLR4 expression did not appear to explain these data macrophages had much lower NLRP3 inflammasome expression compared to CD11bHI macrophages Gene expression profiling also demonstrated expression of inflammatory genes in CD11bHI macrophages but not in cells Genes expressed in CD11bHI macrophages were more likely to contain predicted binding sites in their promoter regions Our data show that CD11bHI macrophages derived from fetal liver are the major cells in the developing fetus These findings could have important implications in better understanding the fetal inflammatory response and

Activation Alters Bone Macrophage Differentiation JOURNAL OF INNATE IMMUNITY Lakhdari Yamamura Hoffman Prince 2019 11 1 Abstract Early exposure to inflammatory signals may have a lasting impact on immune function Present throughout embryogenesis macrophages are key cells providing innate immune protection to the developing fetus and newborn Here we have used an established model of macrophage development to test how early inflammatory signals can impact cellular differentiation and function Bone macrophages were treated with Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide LPS 2 days after initial isolation and culture LPS treatment during this early stage of differentiation decreased the expression of CSF1R and increased that of the mature macrophage marker These early changes in macrophage differentiation were also measured in cells from mice lacking IKKβ but the change in CSF1R expression after LPS treatment was blocked with MAPK inhibition changes in macrophage marker expression persisted following LPS removal suggesting that early inflammatory activation could induce a lasting developmental impact Early LPS exposure inhibited macrophage phagocytosis of labeled coli while LPS had no effect on fully differentiated macrophages Our data demonstrate that early inflammatory exposure to a microbial stimulus induce lasting phenotypic changes in macrophages View details for DOI

GENETICS Prince 2018 9 517 Abstract Lung diseases impact patients across the lifespan from infants in the first minutes of life through the aged population Congenital abnormalities of lung structure can cause lung disease at birth or make adults more susceptible to chronic disease Continuous inhalation of atmospheric components also requires the lung to be resilient to cellular injury Fibroblast growth factor 10 FGF10 regulates multiple stages of structural lung morphogenesis cellular differentiation and the response to injury As a driver of lung airway branching morphogenesis FGF10 signaling defects during development lead to neonatal lung disease Alternatively congenital airway abnormalities attributed to FGF10 mutations increase the risk of chronic airway disease in adulthood FGF10 also maintains progenitor cell populations in the airway and promotes alveolar type 2 cell expansion and differentiation following injury Here we review the cellular and molecular mechanisms linking FGF10 to multiple lung diseases from bronchopulmonary dysplasia in extremely preterm neonates cystic fibrosis in children and chronic adult lung disorders Understanding the connections between FGF10 and

A Lakhdari Blackwel Prince 2017 187 12 Abstract In the immature lung inflammation and injury disrupt the interactions required for normal development Innate immune signaling and activation disrupt the normal expression of multiple mesenchymal genes that play a key role in airway branching and alveolar formation To test the role of the pathway specifically in lung mesenchyme we utilized the mesenchymal to drive expression of a constitutively active inhibitor of kinase subunit β IKKβca mutant in developing mice Embryonic mice were generated in expected numbers and appeared grossly normal Airway branching also appeared normal in embryos with airway morphometry elastin staining and saccular branching similar to those in control littermates While lungs did not contain increased levels of Il1b we did measure an increased expression of the gene Ccl2 lungs had increased staining for the vascular marker platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1 In addition type I alveolar epithelial differentiation appeared to be diminished in lungs The normal airway branching and lack of Il1b expression may have been due to the inability of the transgene to induce inflammasome activity While lungs had an increased number of macrophages inflammasome expression remained restricted to macrophages without evidence of spontaneous inflammasome activity These results emphasize the importance of

Medal Im Yamamoto Lakhdari Blackwell Hoffman Sahoo Prince 2017 312 6 Abstract In preterm infants soluble inflammatory mediators target lung mesenchymal cells disrupting airway and alveolar morphogenesis However how mesenchymal cells respond directly to microbial stimuli remains poorly characterized Our objective was to measure the innate immune response in fetal lung mesenchymal cells exposed to the bacterial endotoxin lipopolysaccharide LPS With the use of Affymetrix MoGene arrays we showed that LPS induced expression of unique innate immune transcripts heavily weighted toward CC and CXC family chemokines The transcriptional response was different between cells from E11 E15 and E18 mouse lungs In all cells tested LPS inhibited expression of a small core group of genes including the VEGF receptor Vegfr2 Although best characterized in vascular endothelial populations we demonstrated here that fetal mouse lung mesenchymal cells express Vegfr2 and respond to stimulation In mesenchymal cells increased cell migration activated the pathway and promoted FOXO3A nuclear exclusion With the use of an experimental coculture model of interactions we also showed that VEGFR2 inhibition prevented formation of structures Both LPS and tyrosine kinase inhibition reduced structure formation Our data suggest a novel mechanism for defects in lung development

dsRNA result in signaling through the TLR3 pathway the pathway which can activate type I IFN proinflammatory cytokines and apoptosis It is not clear whether MAVS could play a role in responses to extracellular dsRNA Using a model of epithelial cells that express a functional TLR3 signaling pathway we found that responses to extracellular dsRNA are negatively regulated by MAVS precisely miniMAVS a recently described 50kDa isoform of MAVS This regulation of TLR3 by a MAVS isoform constitutes an endogenous regulatory mechanism in epithelial cells that could help prevent a potentially

Yanagisawa Davidson Prince Young Blackwell 2016 186 7 Abstract The highly orchestrated interactions between the epithelium and mesenchyme required for normal lung development can be disrupted by perinatal inflammation in preterm infants although the mechanisms are incompletely understood We used transgenic inhibitory κB kinase β transactivated mice that conditionally express an activator of the pathway in airway epithelium to investigate the impact of inflammation during lung development Epithelial activation selectively impaired saccular stage lung development with a phenotype comprising rapidly progressive distal airspace dilation impaired gas exchange and perinatal lethality inflammation resulted in disrupted elastic fiber organization and of elastin assembly components including fibulins 4 and 5 lysyl oxidase and expression by saccular stage lung fibroblasts was consistently inhibited by treatment with bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from inhibitory κB kinase β transactivated mice Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide or tracheal aspirates from preterm infants exposed to chorioamnionitis Expression of a dominant inhibitor in fibroblasts restored expression after lipopolysaccharide treatment whereas reconstitution of rescued extracellular elastin assembly by saccular stage lung fibroblasts Elastin organization was disrupted in saccular stage lungs of preterm infants exposed to systemic inflammation Our study reveals a critical window for elastin assembly during the saccular stage that is disrupted by inflammatory signaling and could be amenable to interventions that restore elastic fiber assembly in the developing lung View details for DOI View details for Web of Science ID 000378758400008 View details for PubMedID 27181406 View details for

196 8 Abstract Inflammation in the developing preterm lung leads to disrupted airway morphogenesis and chronic lung disease in human neonates However the molecular mechanisms linking inflammation and the pathways controlling airway morphogenesis remain unclear In this article we show that released by activated fetal lung macrophages is the key inflammatory mediator that disrupts airway morphogenesis In mouse lung explants blocking expression posttranslational processing and signaling protected the formation of new airways from the inhibitory effects ofEscherichia coliLPS Consistent with a critical role for mice expressing a and subsequent overactive inflammasome activity displayed abnormal lung morphogenesis and died soon after birth Although the fetal lung appeared capable of mounting an immune response airway formation became more sensitive to inflammation later in development This period of susceptibility coincided with higher expression of multiple inflammasome components that could increase the ability to release bioactive Macrophages mice also expressed higher levels of more mature cell surface markers additionally linking inflammasome activation with macrophage maturation These data identify developmental expression of the inflammasome and release by fetal lung macrophages as key mechanisms and potential therapeutic targets for neonatal lung

Macrophages during Acute Lung Inflammation AMERICAN JOURNAL OF RESPIRATORY CELL AND MOLECULAR BIOLOGY Han Zaynagetdinov Yull Polosukhin Gleaves Tanjore Young Peterson Manning Prince Blackwell 2015 53 1 Abstract Characterization of markers that identify activated macrophages could advance understanding of inflammatory lung diseases and facilitate development of novel methodologies for monitoring disease activity We investigated whether folate receptor β FRβ expression could be used to identify and quantify activated macrophages in the lungs during acute inflammation induced by Escherichia coli LPS We found that FRβ expression was markedly increased in lung macrophages at 48 hours after intratracheal LPS In vivo molecular imaging with a fluorescent probe cyanine 5 polyethylene glycol folate showed that the fluorescence signal over the chest peaked at 48 hours after intratracheal LPS and was markedly attenuated after depletion of macrophages Using flow cytometry we identified the cells responsible for uptake of cyanine folate as FRβ interstitial macrophages and pulmonary monocytes which coexpressed markers associated with an M1 proinflammatory macrophage phenotype These findings were confirmed using a second model of acute lung inflammation generated by inducible transgenic expression of an activator in airway epithelium Using CC chemokine receptor mice we found that FRβ recruitment was dependent on the monocyte chemotactic chemokine receptor 2 pathway Together our results demonstrate that molecular imaging can be used as a noninvasive approach to detect classically activated recruited to the lungs during acute inflammation View details for DOI View details for Web of Science ID 000362125500008 View details for PubMedID 25375039 View details for

Meer Gleaves Bulus Han Prince Blackwell Zent 2014 141 24 Abstract interactions between cells and extracellular matrix regulate lung development however specific roles for integrins in individual cell types including epithelial cells remain incompletely understood In this study the functional importance of β1 integrin in lung epithelium during mouse lung development was investigated by deleting the integrin from onwards using surfactant protein C Cre These mutant mice appeared normal at birth but failed to gain weight appropriately and died by 4 months of age with severe hypoxemia Defects in airway branching morphogenesis in association with impaired epithelial cell adhesion and migration as well as alveolarization defects and persistent inflammation were identified Using an inducible system to delete β1 integrin after completion of airway branching we showed that alveolarization defects characterized by disrupted secondary septation abnormal alveolar epithelial cell differentiation excessive collagen I and elastin deposition and hypercellularity of the mesenchyme occurred independently of airway branching defects By depleting macrophages using liposomal clodronate we found that alveolarization defects were secondary to persistent alveolar inflammation β1 alveolar epithelial cells produced excessive monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 and reactive oxygen species suggesting a direct role for β1 integrin in regulating alveolar homeostasis Taken together these studies define distinct functions of epithelial β1 integrin during both early and late

The molecular pathways that regulate this complex process are beginning to be defined and such knowledge is critical to our understanding of congenital and acquired lung diseases A recent workshop was convened by the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute to discuss the developmental principles that regulate the formation of the pulmonary system Emerging evidence suggests that key developmental pathways not only regulate proper formation of the pulmonary system but are also reactivated upon postnatal injury and repair and in the pathogenesis of human lung diseases Molecular understanding of early lung development has also led to new advances in areas such as generation of lung epithelium from pluripotent stem cells The workshop was organized into four different topics including early lung cell fate and morphogenesis mechanisms of lung cell differentiation tissue interactions in lung development and environmental impact on early lung development Critical points were raised including the importance of epigenetic regulation of lung gene expression the dearth of knowledge on important mesenchymal lineages within the lung and the interaction between the developing pulmonary and cardiovascular system This manuscript describes the summary of the discussion along with general recommendations to overcome the gaps in knowledge in lung developmental biology View details for
