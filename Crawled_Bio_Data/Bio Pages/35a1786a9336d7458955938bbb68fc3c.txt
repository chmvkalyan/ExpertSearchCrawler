of acute lymphoblastic leukemia ALL We conducted a retrospective multicenter cohort analysis of 239 ALL patients 227 relapsed refractory RR n 227 minimal residual disease MRD n 12 who received blinatumomab outside of clinical trials to evaluate safety and efficacy in the setting The median age of patients at blinatumomab initiation was 48 years range 26 patients had prior therapies and 46 19 had allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation before blinatumomab The response rate complete remission with incomplete count recovery in patients with RR disease was 65 47 Among 12 patients who received blinatumomab for MRD 9 75 patients achieved MRD negativity In patients with RR disease median survival and overall survival OS after blinatumomab was 32 months and months respectively Among patients who received blinatumomab for MRD median survival was not reached 54 at 2 years and OS was months Grade cytokine release syndrome neurotoxicity and hepatotoxicity were observed in 3 7 and 10 of patients respectively Among patients who achieved complete remission with incomplete count recovery consolidation therapy with allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation retained favorable prognostic significance for OS hazard ratio 95 confidence interval P In this largest experience published to date blinatumomab demonstrated responses comparable to those reported in clinical trials

Adult Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia in the Modern Era of Immune Therapy Current hematologic malignancy reports Yurkiewicz Craig Muffly 2020 Abstract PURPOSE OF REVIEW This review will discuss the data and controversies related to HCT in the and setting in the context of newly available targeted FINDINGS Recent studies in adult ALL support the use of measurable residual disease MRD response to therapy to guide consolidation As such most patients do not require HCT Blinatumomab benefits patients with with complete response CR and can be used as a bridge to HCT whether HCT is still required in this setting is an area of ongoing inquiry Blinatumomab and inotuzumab result in high rates of MRD negative CR in adults with ALL and allow more patients with relapsed disease to receive HCT Chimeric antigen receptor T cell therapies may serve as a bridge to HCT or as a therapy for patients data suggests there may be greater benefit to consolidating with HCT in adults The decision to incorporate consolidative allogeneic HCT into therapy should be primarily guided by MRD status and the ALL regimen utilized Targeted immunotherapies result in high CR rates allowing more adults with ALL to be successfully bridged to HCT early incorporation of these therapies may also prove valuable in reducing the need for HCT in the setting by increasing MRD negative CR rates View details for

Podoltsev Patel Curran Wang Arslan Aldoss Siebenaller Mattison Litzow Wadleigh Advani Atallah 2020 Abstract The availability of novel agents NAs including blinatumomab and inotuzumab ozogamicin InO has improved the outcomes of patients with RR acute lymphoblastic leukemia ALL Because of the relative effectiveness it is often a challenge for clinicians to determine how to best sequence these NAs with respect to efficacy and this multicenter retrospective study of patients with RR ALL treated with blinatumomab InO or both their efficacy as a first or second NA was 276 patients 221 and 55 received blinatumomab and InO respectively as a first NA therapy The complete remission CR remission with incomplete count recovery CRi rate was 65 and 67 for the blinatumomab and InO groups respectively P The rate of treatment discontinuation due to adverse events was 4 and 7 in the blinatumomab and InO groups respectively patients 43 in the blinatumomab group and 13 patients 29 in the InO group proceeded with allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation The median overall survival OS was 15 and months in the blinatumomab and InO groups respectively A subset analysis was performed for 61 patients who received both NAs blinatumomab and then InO n 40 or InO and then blinatumomab n 21 The rate was 58 for patients who received InO as the second NA and 52 for patients who received blinatumomab as the second NA The median OS was for patients who received InO as the second NA and months for patients who received blinatumomab as the second NA P the limited power of this study to detect a significant difference between subgroups is acknowledged the data suggest that blinatumomab and InO may have comparable efficacy as a first or second NA therapy in RR ALL View

lymphoblastic leukemia represent a small subset of acute lymphoblastic leukemia ALL patients who received genotoxic therapy ie chemotherapy or radiation for a prior malignancy These patients should be distinguished from patients with de novo ALL and ALL patients who have a history of prior malignancy but have not received cytotoxic therapies in the past acute lymphoblastic leukemia with prior malignancy We report a retrospective study of patients with n 116 n 100 and n 20 to investigate the impact of prior cytotoxic therapies on clinical outcomes Compared with patients with patients had a significantly shorter interval between the first malignancy and ALL diagnosis and a higher frequency of cytogenetic features including KMT2A rearrangements and myelodysplastic abnormalities eg monosomal karyotype We observed a variety of mutations among patients with the majority of patients exhibiting mutations that were more common with myeloid malignancies eg DNMT3A RUNX1 ASXL1 whereas others had mutations eg CDKN2A IKZF1 Median overall survival was significantly shorter in the cohort compared with patients with or Patients who were eligible for hematopoietic cell transplantation

cure in newly diagnosed adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia ALL the prognosis for patients with relapsed or refractory disease remains poor and the overall survival rate after relapse is under 10 A recent paradigm shift has focused on the promise of targeted immunotherapy rather than standard chemotherapy as ALL blast cells express a variety of antigens and monoclonal antibodies may be developed to identify and destroy the leukemic cells Inotuzumab ozogamicin is a CD22 monoclonal antibody conjugated to the cytotoxic antibiotic calicheamicin CD22 expression is detected on leukemic blasts in over 90 of patients with ALL Based on promising results from preclinical studies inotuzumab ozogamicin was tested in Phase and Phase 3 clinical trials and it demonstrated improved complete remission rates survival and overall survival in relapsed or refractory adult ALL compared to standard therapy Ongoing studies are evaluating the value of inotuzumab ozogamicin when given in combination with

of experience with and beliefs surrounding respondents had dealt with questions about GIFs 74 but only a minority 47 felt prepared to address them Although a majority believed that there is an obligation to disclose GIFs 78 there is still not consensus about the supporting ethical principles Respondents generally did not endorse the idea that researchers additional time and effort 7 and lack of resources 29 were valid reasons for diminishing a putative obligation Most 96 supported a right not to know but this view became less pronounced 63 when framed in terms of specific case are actively engaged with GIFs but have not yet reached consensus Respondents were uncomfortable with arguments that could be used to limit an obligation to return GIFs This could indicate that IRBs are providing some of the impetus for the trend toward returning GIFs although questions remain about the relative contribution of other Med 18 7 View details for DOI View details for Web of Science ID

review current literature on neurology telemedicine and to discuss its application to patient care neurology practice military medicine and current federal of practice models and published literature on primary studies of the efficacy of neurology is of greatest benefit to populations with restricted access to general and subspecialty neurologic care in rural areas those with limited mobility and those deployed by the military Through the use of interaction imaging and systems a greater proportion of neurologists are able to meet the demand for specialty care in underserved communities decrease the response time for acute stroke assessment and expand the collaboration between primary care physicians neurologists and other disciplines The American Stroke Association has developed a defined policy on teleneurology and the American Academy of Neurology and federal health care policy are beginning to follow is an effective tool for the rapid evaluation of patients in remote locations requiring neurologic care These underserved locations include geographically isolated rural areas as well as urban cores with insufficient available neurology specialists With this technology neurologists will be better able to meet the burgeoning demand for access to neurologic care in an era of declining availability An increase in physician awareness and support at the federal and state level is necessary to facilitate expansion of telemedicine into further areas of neurology View details for DOI View details for Web of Science ID 000314878500015 View details for
