solifenacin in a multiple sclerosis MS population with overactive bladder OAB AND METHODS MS patients with OAB symptoms who were not on medication for their urinary symptoms at enrollment were prospectively recruited Patients enrolled in years were prescribed mirabegron whereas patients enrolled in years were prescribed solifenacin At enrollment and followup patients completed several patient reported outcome measures PROMs The primary outcome was change in Overactive Bladder Questionnaire Short Form SF symptom severity and minimal clinically important difference MCID achievement The Patient Assessment of Constipation Symptoms was used to assess bowel function over the treatment 61 patients were enrolled The majority of the mirabegron 70 and the solifenacin 69 group achieved the SF symptom severity MCID The solifenacin group had a statistically significant greater decrease in its end of study SF score Delta versus Constipation improved in the mirabegron group and worsened in the solifenacin group versus with 30 of patients prescribed solifenacin experiencing worsening above the MCID Among MS patients we demonstrated similar response rates to mirabegron and solifenacin with approximately achieving each PROM MCID Though this small study showed some evidence that improvement in urinary symptom severity was greater with solifenacin this potential benefit must be weighed against the observed risk of worsening constipation Further studies are needed to confirm these findings View details for DOI View details for PubMedID 32822687 Sacral Nerve Stimulation in

BOOI were observed in the Stage I trial At our institution PD patients have a similar rate of progression to Stage II compared to the general population SNS is an effective therapy that should be

sling revision surgery a tradeoff analysis for continent women undergoing pelvic organ prolapse surgery International urogynecology journal Dallas Syan Enemchukwu Elliott 2020 Abstract INTRODUCTION AND HYPOTHESIS Although urinary incontinence surgery has potential benefits such as preventing de novo stress urinary incontinence in women undergoing pelvic organ prolapse POP surgery it comes with the potential cost of overtreatment and complications We compared future surgery rates in a population cohort of women undergoing vaginal pelvic organ prolapse All women undergoing POP repair in California from 2005 to 2011 were identified from the Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development databases Rates of repeat surgery in those with and without concomitant urethral sling procedures were compared To control for confounding effects multivariate mixed effects logistic regression models were constructed to compare each woman individualized risk of undergoing either sling revision surgery or future incontinence In the cohort underwent a sling procedure at the time of POP repair and did not The future surgery rate was higher for complications in the POP sling cohort compared with future incontinence surgery in the POP alone cohort versus respectively p The difference persisted in multivariate modeling where most women 60 are at a higher risk of requiring sling revision surgery compared with needing a future primary incontinence procedure 40 Women who undergo vaginal prolapse repair without an incontinence procedure are at a low risk of future incontinence surgery Women without urinary incontinence who are considering vaginal POP surgery should be informed of the risks and benefits of including a sling procedure View details for DOI View details for

based on the last decade of MAUDE safety reports Menopause New York Wallace Sokol Enemchukwu A 2020 Abstract devices have gained momentum as minimally invasive procedures to treat both medical and cosmetic pelvic floor disorders including genitourinary syndrome of menopause vaginal laxity stress urinary incontinence dyspareunia and vulvar disorders such as lichen diseases and vestibulitis However the FDA recently issued a statement cautioning patients and providers that the safety and efficacy of devices for the treatment of vaginal symptoms has not been well established Additionally the FDA sent letters to the manufactures of devices with notifications that they could be violating the marketing standards of the FDA The existing data on side effects is insufficient and limited to observational studies We sought to characterize the safety events of vaginal devices by analysis of surveillance data from the FDA Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience MAUDE database and specifically look at those events that occurred prior to the July 30 2018 MAUDE database was queried between September 30 2013 and October 31 2019 for all vaginal devices The incidence of safety events was reported for these devices and the most common complaints were described and characterized Event reporting was analyzed before and after July 30 unique and relevant medical device reports MDRs were retrieved The Mona Lisa Touch had the highest number of MDRs followed by ThermiVa and Viveve Each medical device report was associated with a single patient experience and within the 42 medical device reports there were 85 complaints A majority of the MDR complaints were also indications for devices procedures which include vaginal pain dyspareunia lichen sclerosis and urinary frequency of the complaints were related to pain but serious adverse events such as burns were rare Most of the reportable events occurred before July 30 2018 but most were reported after July 30 2018 data suggests that the majority of patient complaints after vaginal device treatment include vaginal pain bladder pain and urinary symptoms This study suggests that the majority of complaints are not severe and some may be related to progression of the disease The few severe adverse events reported in the MAUDE database may have contributed to the FDA warning regarding devices Recall bias after the FDA warning as well as the potential for litigation may have prompted an increase in adverse event reporting after July 30 Video Summary http View details for DOI View details for PubMedID

dual prolapse only of women with POP had both diagnoses Overall of women had one or more surgical repairs Surgical repairs were done in of women with POP of women with RP and of women with comorbid though only of patients with dual diagnoses had both RP and POP repairs Over the study period the rate of multidisciplinary surgical repairs increased by prevalence of comorbid RP and POP among women in our cohort is low Rates of multidisciplinary surgery have increased possibly due to the increased use of imaging laparoscopic surgery and awareness of the shared pathophysiology of the disease View

postoperative complications were noted in the MIS group compared to of those patients in the laparotomy group p Overall in those patients who underwent combined RP and POP surgery the need for subsequent RP surgery for recurrent RP was 14 and the need for subsequent POP surgery for recurrent POP was p this cohort of women undergoing combined RP and POP surgery a higher proportion required subsequent RP surgery compared to those requiring subsequent POP surgery although this was not statistically significant Almost of patients undergoing combined RP and POP surgery experienced a surgical complication regardless of whether the approach was perineal or abdominal For those patients undergoing abdominal repair complications were more likely in those patients who had a laparotomy

to avoid SNS in the elderly This study evaluates the safety and efficacy of SNS for refractory OAB among our octogenarian A retrospective review from a single institution was performed on all SNS lead placements from December 1998 to June 2017 for refractory OAB Octogenarians were characterized as 80years of age or older at the time of Stage Efficacy and safety were determined by the rate of progression to Stage II subsequent need for multimodal therapy and rate of surgical revision and explantation All patients were followed for a minimum of Of 374 patients in this study 37 were octogenarians There was no difference in gender race smoking history or prior OAB treatment regimens between cohorts The rate of progression to Stage II was for octogenarians compared to for nonoctogenarians p The rate of surgical revision explantation and need for multimodal therapy did not differ between groups Subgroup analysis of octogenarians did not reveal any significant differences between successful and nonsuccessful Stage I The safety and efficacy of SNS was similar between cohorts This result suggests that SNS is a safe and effective therapy that should be

OBJECTIVE To evaluate the association of hysterectomy at the time of pelvic organ prolapse POP repair with the risk of undergoing subsequent POP surgery in a large Data from the California Office of
