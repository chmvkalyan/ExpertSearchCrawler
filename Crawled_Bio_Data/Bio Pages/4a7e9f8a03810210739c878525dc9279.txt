Essential Vocal Tremor in Deep Brain Stimulation Surgery American journal of pathology Sung Ho Halpern 2020 Abstract Purpose Essential vocal tremor EVT is a prevalent and voice disorder There is evidence that deep brain stimulation DBS of the ventral intermediate nucleus Vim of the thalamus may be beneficial for treating EVT The objective of this preliminary investigation was to conduct intraoperative voice assessments during implantation in order to evaluate immediate voice outcomes in essential tremor patients with EVT Method Seven adult subjects diagnosed with EVT undergoing surgery participated in this investigation Voice samples of sustained vowels were collected by a pathologist preoperatively and intraoperatively immediately following electrode placement Voice evaluation included objective acoustic assessment of the rate and extent of EVT fundamental frequency and intensity modulation and subjective perceptual ratings of EVT severity Results The rate of intensity modulation extent of fundamental frequency modulation and perceptual rating of EVT severity were significantly reduced intraoperatively as compared to preoperatively Moderate positive correlations were appreciated between a subset of acoustic measures and perceptual severity ratings Conclusions The results of this study demonstrate a pathologist can conduct evaluation of EVT during DBS surgery Using a noninvasive simple acoustic recording method we were able to supplement perceptual subjective observation with objective assessment and demonstrate immediate intraoperative improvements in EVT The findings of this analysis inform the added value of intraoperative voice evaluation in patients and contribute to the growing body of literature seeking to evaluate the efficacy of DBS as a treatment for EVT View details for DOI View details for PubMedID 32073285 Interobserver Agreement for the CT Severity Grading Scales for Acute Traumatic Brain Injury TBI Journal

Zhang Parvizi J 2020 11 1 325 Abstract Neuroimaging evidence suggests that the default mode network DMN exhibits antagonistic activity with dorsal attention DAN and salience SN networks Here we use human intracranial electroencephalography to investigate the behavioral relevance of dynamics within and between these networks The three networks show dissociable profiles of electrophysiological activity best captured in the broadband HFB range On the order of hundreds of milliseconds HFB responses peak fastest in the DAN at intermediate speed in the SN and slowest in the DMN Lapses of attention behavioral errors are marked by distinguishable patterns of both and HFB activity within each network Moreover the magnitude of temporally lagged negative HFB coupling between the DAN and DMN but not SN and DMN is associated with greater sustained attention performance and is reduced during wakeful rest These findings underscore the behavioral relevance of temporally delayed

probabilistic and approach Human brain mapping Su Choi Tourdias Saranathan Halpern Henderson Pauly Ghanouni Rutt 2020 Abstract Magnetic focused ultrasound MRgFUS ablation of the ventral intermediate Vim thalamic nucleus is an incisionless treatment for essential tremor ET The standard initial targeting method uses an approximate stereotactic approach We developed a new targeting method to identify an individual Vim and the optimal MRgFUS target region therein for suppression of tremor In this retrospective study of 14 ET patients treated with MRgFUS we investigated the ability of WMnMPRAGE a highly sensitive and robust sequence for imaging gray matter contrast to identify the Vim FUS ablation and a clinically efficacious region within the Vim in individual patients We found that WMnMPRAGE can directly visualize the Vim in ET patients segmenting this nucleus using manual or automated segmentation capabilities developed by our group WMnMPRAGE also delineated the ablation core and penumbra and showed that all patients ablation cores lay primarily within their Vim segmentations We found no significant correlations between standard ablation features ablation volume overlap and clinical outcome We then defined a probabilistic target which was nonlinearly warped to individual brains this target was located within the Vim for all patients The overlaps between this target and patient ablation cores correlated significantly with clinical outcome r p in contrast to the standard target r p We conclude that WMnMPRAGE is a highly sensitive sequence for segmenting Vim and ablation boundaries in individual patients allowing us to find a novel center within Vim and potentially improving MRgFUS treatment for ET View details for DOI View details for PubMedID 32762005

human neuroscience Saluja Barbosa Parker Huang Jensen Ngo Santini Pauly Ghanouni McNab J Halpern 2020 14 191 Abstract Essential tremor ET is the most prevalent movement disorder in adults and can often be medically refractory requiring surgical intervention focused ultrasound MRgFUS is a less invasive procedure that uses ultrasonic waves to induce lesions in the ventralis intermedius nucleus VIM to treat refractory ET As with all procedures for treating ET optimal targeting during MRgFUS is essential for efficacy and durability Various studies have reported cases of tremor recurrence following MRgFUS and outcome data is limited to years We present a investigation on a case of DBS rescue for medically refractory ET that was treated with MRgFUS that was interrupted due to the development of dysarthria during the procedure After initial improvement her hand tremor started to recur within 6 months after treatment and bilateral DBS was performed targeting the VIM 24 months after MRgFUS DBS induced tremor control with monopolar stimulation Diffusion MRI tractography was used to reconstruct the dentatorubrothalamic DRTT and corticothalmic CTT tracts being modulated by the procedures to understand the variability in efficacy between MRgFUS and DBS in treating ET in our patient By comparing the MRgFUS lesion and DBS volume of activated tissue VAT we found that the MRgFUS lesion was located ventromedially to the VAT and was less than 10 of the size of the VAT While the lesion encompassed the same proportion of DRTT streamlines it encompassed fewer CTT streamlines than the VAT Our findings indicate the need for further investigation of targeting the CTT when using neuromodulatory procedures to treat refractory ET for more permanent tremor relief View details for DOI

consensus has yet to emerge whether deep brain stimulation DBS for disorder OCD can be considered an established therapy In 2014 the World Society for Stereotactic and Functional Neurosurgery WSSFN published consensus guidelines stating that a therapy becomes established when at least two blinded randomized controlled clinical trials from two different groups of researchers are published both reporting an acceptable ratio at least comparable with other existing therapies The clinical trials should be on the same brain area for the same psychiatric indication The authors have now compiled the available evidence to make a clear statement on whether DBS for OCD is established therapy Two blinded randomized controlled trials have been published one with level I evidence Obsessive Compulsive Scale score improved 37 during stimulation on the other with level II evidence 25 improvement A clinical cohort study N 70 showed 40 score improvement during DBS and a prospective international study 42 improvement N 30 The WSSFN states that electrical stimulation for otherwise treatment refractory OCD using a multipolar electrode implanted in the ventral anterior capsule region including bed nucleus of stria terminalis and nucleus accumbens remains investigational It represents an emerging but not yet established therapy A multidisciplinary team involving

stimulation DBS of the complex CM can provide effective treatment However patients have reported benefit with activation of contacts dorsal to the CM and likely in the thalamus VL At our institution a case of a robust and durable response in a GTS patient required stimulation in the CM and more dorsally We explore the structural connectivity of thalamic subregions associated with GTS using diffusion MRI tractography Diffusion weighted images from 40 healthy Human Connectome Project HCP subjects and our GTS patient were analyzed The VL posterior nucleus VLp and the CM were used as seeds for probabilistic tractography Leads were localized via linear registration of imaging and with the DBS Intrinsic Template Atlas Tractography revealed high streamline probability from the CM and VLp to the superior frontal gyrus rostral middle frontal gyrus brainstem and ventral diencephalon Given reported variable responses to DBS along the thalamus we segmented the VLp based on its connectivity profile Ventral and dorsal subdivisions emerged with streamline probability patterns differing between the dorsal VLp and CM The CM the most reported DBS target for GTS and the dorsal VLp have different but seemingly complimentary connectivity profiles as evidenced by our patient who at had significant therapeutic benefit Stimulation of both regions may better target reward and motor

Kern Halpern Felsen Thompson J A 2019 9 7 Abstract Observations using invasive neural recordings from patient populations undergoing neurosurgical interventions have led to critical breakthroughs in our understanding of human neural circuit function and malfunction The opportunity to interact with patients during neurophysiological mapping allowed for early insights in functional localization to improve surgical outcomes but has since expanded into exploring fundamental aspects of human cognition including reward processing language the storage and retrieval of memory as well as sensory and motor processing The increasing use of chronic neuromodulation via deep brain stimulation for a spectrum of neurological and psychiatric conditions has in tandem led to increased opportunity for linking theories of cognitive processing and neural circuit function Our purpose here is to motivate the neuroscience and neurosurgical community to capitalize on the opportunities that this next decade will bring To this end we will highlight recent studies that have successfully leveraged invasive recordings during deep brain stimulation surgery to advance our understanding of human cognition with an emphasis on reward processing improving clinical outcomes and informing advances in neuromodulatory interventions View details for DOI View details for PubMedID 31330813 Deep Brain

Effects of surgical targeting in laser interstitial thermal therapy for mesial temporal lobe epilepsy A multicenter study of 234 patients Epilepsia Wu Jermakowicz Chakravorti Cajigas Sharan Jagid Matias Sperling Buckley Ko Ojemann Miller Youngerman Sheth McKhann Laxton Couture Popli Smith Mehta Ho Halpern Englot Neimat Konrad Neal Vale Holloway Air Schwalb Dawant 2019 Abstract OBJECTIVE Laser interstitial thermal therapy LITT for mesial temporal lobe epilepsy mTLE has reported seizure freedom rates between 36 and 78 with at least 1 year of Unfortunately the lack of robust methods capable of incorporating the inherent variability of patient anatomy the variability of the ablated volumes and clinical outcomes have limited quantitative analysis of surgical targeting and its impact on seizure outcomes We therefore aimed to leverage a novel methodology for normalizing surgical therapies across a large multicenter cohort to quantify the effects of surgical targeting on seizure outcomes in LITT for This multicenter retrospective cohort study included 234 patients from 11 centers who underwent LITT for mTLE To investigate therapy location all ablation cavities were manually traced on postoperative magnetic resonance imaging MRI which were subsequently nonlinearly normalized to a common atlas space The association of clinical variables and ablation location to seizure outcome was calculated using multivariate regression and Bayesian models Ablations including more anterior medial and inferior temporal lobe structures which involved greater amygdalar volume were more likely to be associated with Engel class I outcomes At both 1 and 2 years after LITT achieved Engel I outcomes A history of bilateral seizures decreased chances of Engel I outcome Radiographic hippocampal sclerosis was not associated with seizure LITT is a viable treatment for mTLE in patients who have been properly evaluated at a comprehensive epilepsy center Consideration of surgical factors is imperative to the complete assessment of LITT Based on our model ablations must prioritize the amygdala and also include the hippocampal head parahippocampal gyrus and rhinal cortices to maximize chances of seizure freedom Extending the ablation posteriorly has diminishing returns Further work is necessary to refine this analysis and define the minimal zone of ablation necessary for seizure control View details for DOI View details for PubMedID 31112302 Robust clinical benefit of deep brain stimulation for treatment of Gilles de la Tourette syndrome and its comorbidities BRAIN

NAc is implicated in numerous neuropsychiatric disorders Treatments targeting this area directly deep brain stimulation demonstrate variable efficacy perhaps owing to targeting of a functionally heterogeneous nucleus Here we provide support for this notion first observing disparate behavioral effects in response to direct simulation of different locations within the NAc in a human patient These observations motivate a segmentation of the NAc into subregions which we produce from a based analysis of 245 young unrelated healthy subjects We further explore the mechanism of these behavioral responses by identifying the most probable subset of axons activated using a computational model We validate our segmentation using evidence from several modalities including measures of function and microstructure human immunohistochemical staining and comparison of projections that are known to be conserved Finally we visualize the passage of individual axon bundles through one NAc subregion in a human sample using CLARITY 3D histology corroborated by 7T tractography Collectively these findings extensively characterize human NAc subregions and provide insight into their

neuroablation as a promising therapy for disorder OCD This technique appears to offer a more favorable complication rate and higher utility than deep brain stimulation Moreover these pooled findings suggest that bilateral radiofrequency RF capsulotomy has marginally greater efficacy than stereotactic radiosurgery or cingulotomy focused ultrasound MRgFUS capsulotomy is an emerging approach with a potentially more favorable profile than RF ablation and radiosurgery with preliminary data suggesting safety and efficacy As a clinical trial is being developed our study examined the cost and clinical parameters necessary for MRgFUS capsulotomy to be a more alternative to RF capsulotomy A decision analytical model of MRgFUS with RF capsulotomy for OCD was performed using outcome parameters of percent surgical improvement in Obsessive Compulsive Scale score complications and side effects The analysis compared measured societal costs derived from Medicare reimbursement rates and effectiveness based on published RF data Effectiveness was defined as the degree to which MRgFUS lowered score Given that MRgFUS is a new therapy for OCD with scant published data theoretical risks of MRgFUS capsulotomy were derived from published essential tremor outcomes Sensitivity analysis yielded cost effectiveness and complication rates as critical MRgFUS parameters defining the threshold

Grant Wintermark Halpern 2018 128 4 Abstract OBJECTIVE laser interstitial thermal therapy MRgLITT is a minimally invasive method for thermal destruction of benign or malignant tissue that has been used for selective amygdalohippocampal ablation for the treatment of temporal lobe epilepsy The authors report their initial experience adopting a stereotactic platform that allows for completion of the entire procedure in the MRI suite METHODS Between October 2014 and May 2016 17 patients with mesial temporal sclerosis were selected by a multidisciplinary epilepsy board to undergo a selective amygdalohippocampal ablation for temporal lobe epilepsy using MRgLITT The first 9 patients underwent standard laser ablation in 2 phases operating room OR and MRI suite whereas the next 8 patients underwent laser ablation entirely in the MRI suite with the ClearPoint platform A checklist specific to the laser amydalohippocampal ablation was developed and used for each case For both cohorts clinical and operative information including average case times and accuracy data was collected and analyzed RESULTS There was a learning curve associated with using this system However operative times decreased in a linear fashion as did total anesthesia time In fact the total mean patient procedure time was less in the MRI cohort minutes than in the OR cohort minutes The mean anesthesia time was significantly shorter in the MRI cohort minutes than in the OR cohort minutes p CONCLUSIONS The MRI platform for MRgLITT can be adopted in an expedient manner Completion of MRgLITT entirely in the

structures METHODS The body of the hippocampus contains a natural axis approximated by the interface of cornu ammonis area 4 and the dentate gyrus The uncal recess of the lateral ventricle acts as a landmark to characterize the extent of this axis Several volumetric rotations are quantified for alignment with the mesial temporal coordinate system First the brain volume is rotated to align with standard anterior commissure space Then it is rotated through the axial and sagittal angles that the hippocampal axis makes with the line RESULTS Using this coordinate system customized MATLAB software was developed to allow for intuitive standardization of targeting and interpretation The angle between the line and the hippocampal axis was found to be approximately when viewed sagittally and approximately when viewed axially Implanted electrodes can then be identified from CT in this space and laser tip position and burn geometry can be calculated based on the intraoperative and postoperative MRI CONCLUSIONS With the advent of stereotactic surgery for mesial temporal targets a mesial temporal stereotactic system is introduced that may facilitate operative planning improve surgical outcomes and standardize outcome assessment View details for PubMedID 29372873 Hair sparing does not compromise magnetic resonance imaging guided stereotactic laser fiber placement for temporal lobe epilepsy Journal of clinical neuroscience official journal of the Neurosurgical Society of Australasia Singh Kumar Rabon Dolce Halpern 2018 52 Abstract scalp shaving is conventionally thought to simplify postoperative cranial wound care lower the rate of wound infections and ease optimal incision localization Over the past few decades some neurosurgeons have refrained from scalp shaving in order to improve patient satisfaction with brain surgery However this approach has not yet been explored in the growing field of magnetic laser interstitial thermal therapy MRgLITT This study investigated the initial impact of a technique on wound infection rate as well as on entry and target accuracy in MRgLITT for mesial temporal epilepsy Eighteen patients selected by the Stanford Comprehensive Epilepsy Program between November 2015 and August 2017 were included in the study All patients underwent functional selective amygdalohippocampotomies using MRgLITT entirely within a diagnostic MRI suite No hair was removed and no additional precautions were taken for hair or scalp care Otherwise routine protocols for surgical preparations and wound closure were followed The study was performed under approval from Stanford University Internal Review Board No wound infections or erosions occurred for any patient The mean entry point error was mm and the mean target error was mm There have been no other complications associated with this approach The study results suggest that hair sparing in MRgLITT surgery for temporal epilepsy does not increase the risk of wound complications or compromise accuracy This preferred cosmetic approach may thus appeal to epilepsy patients considering such interventions View details for PubMedID 29602604 Letter Electric Beats Open

diffusion MRI data between the treated thalamus and the region of the ipsilateral motor cortex the entire ipsilateral motor cortex and the contralateral dentate nucleus The locations were compared to the lesion location delineated on 1 year MR image Their overlap was correlated with the clinical outcomes measured by the percentage change of the Clinical Rating Scale for Tremor scores acquired as well as 1 month 3 months 6 months and 1 year The probabilistic tractography was consistent from and followed the expected anatomy of the thalamocortical radiation and the dentatothalamic tract Higher

periods preceding consummatory behavior represent a critical opportunity for intervention However no available therapy is capable of automatically sensing and therapeutically responding to this

2015 Inclusion criteria included patient number 15 report of precision clinical outcomes data and at least 6 months of There were 145 studies 16 of which were under general anaesthesia Data were pooled using an weighted random effects model for observational was no significant difference in mean target error between local and general anaesthesia but there was a significantly less mean number of DBS lead passes with general anaesthesia There were also significant decreases in DBS complications with fewer intracerebral haemorrhages and infections with general anaesthesia p There were no significant differences in Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale UPDRS Section II scores off medication UPDRS III scores off and on medication or levodopa equivalent doses between the two techniques Awake DBS cohorts had a significantly greater decrease in side effects as measured by the UPDRS IV off medication score awake vs asleep demonstrates that while DBS under general anaesthesia may lead to lower complication rates overall awake DBS may lead to less side effects Nevertheless there were no significant differences in clinical motor outcomes between the two techniques Thus DBS under

Goswami Halpern Sudhof Malenka 2017 20 2 Abstract Hippocampal network activity is generated by a complex interplay between excitatory pyramidal cells and inhibitory interneurons Although much is known about the molecular properties of excitatory synapses on pyramidal cells comparatively little is known about excitatory synapses on interneurons Here we show that conditional deletion of the postsynaptic cell adhesion molecule in parvalbumin interneurons causes a decrease in postsynaptic currents and an increase in presynaptic glutamate release probability by selectively impairing the inhibition of glutamate release by presynaptic Group III metabotropic glutamate receptors As a result the deletion altered network activity by reducing gamma oscillations and sharp wave ripples changes associated with a decrease in extinction of contextual fear memories These results demonstrate that specifies the properties of excitatory synapses on interneurons by a retrograde mechanism

radiographic features open surgical resection can achieve high rates of seizure control but can be associated with neurologic deficits and cognitive effects Recent innovations have allowed for more minimally invasive methods of surgical seizure control such as magnetic laser interstitial therapy MRgLITT MRgLITT achieves the goal of ablating seizure foci while preserving function and offering

Comparison in seventeen subject datasets Medical physics Vyas Ghanouni Halpern Elias Pauly B 2016 43 9 Abstract In transcranial magnetic focused ultrasound tcMRgFUS treatments the acoustic and spatial heterogeneity of the skull cause reflection absorption and scattering of the acoustic beams These effects depend on parameters and can lead to thermal responses to the same transducer power In this work the authors develop a simulation tool to help predict these different experimental responses using 3D heterogeneous tissue models based on the subject CT images The authors then validate and compare the predicted skull efficiencies to an experimental metric based on the subject thermal responses during tcMRgFUS treatments in a dataset of seventeen human human head CT scans were used to create tissue acoustic models simulating the effects of reflection absorption and scattering of the acoustic beam as it propagates through a heterogeneous skull The hybrid angular spectrum technique was used to model the acoustic beam propagation of the InSightec ExAblate 4000 head transducer for each subject yielding maps of the specific absorption rate SAR The simulation assumed the transducer was geometrically focused to the thalamus of each subject and the focal SAR at the target was used as a measure of the simulated skull efficiency Experimental skull efficiency for each subject was calculated using the thermal temperature maps from the tcMRgFUS treatments Axial temperature images with no artifacts were reconstructed with a single baseline corrected using a referenceless algorithm The experimental skull efficiency was calculated by dividing the reconstructed temperature rise s after sonication by the applied acoustic simulated skull efficiency using heterogeneous

diversity of the brain has been linking activity during behavior with standard cellular typology For example it has not been possible to determine whether principal neurons in prefrontal cortex active during distinct experiences represent separable cell types and it is not known whether these differentially active cells exert distinct causal influences on behavior Here we develop quantitative technologies to connect activity in cells reporting on behavioral experience with measures for both wiring and molecular phenotype We find that positive and experiences in prefrontal cortex are represented by cell populations that differ in their causal impact on behavior wiring and gene expression profiles with the major discriminant being expression of the gene NPAS4 These findings

physicians measuring pain relief in patients with trigeminal neuralgia TN Unfortunately the measurement of pain can be complex The Brief Pain is a reliable and validated multidimensional tool that consists of 18 questions It measures 3 domains of pain 1 pain intensity worst and average pain intensity 2 interference with general activities of daily living ADL and 3 pain interference The objective of this paper is to determine the minimum clinically important difference MCID using the authors conducted a retrospective study of 234 patients with TN seen in a single neurosurgeon office Patients completed baseline and questionnaires The MCID was calculated using an approach in which the defined anchor was the patient global impression of change PGIC Two statistical methods were employed mean change score and optimal cutoff the mean change score method the investigators calculated the MCID for the 3 domains of the BPIFacial 44 and 30 improvement in pain intensity at its worst and average respectively 54 improvement in interference with general ADL and 63 improvement in interference with facial ADL Using the optimal cutoff point method they also calculated the MCID for the 3 domains of the 57 and 28 improvement in pain intensity at its worst and average respectively 75 improvement in interference with general ADL and 62 improvement in interference with facial is a multidimensional pain scale that measures 3 domains of pain Although 2 statistical methods were used to calculate the MCID the optimal cutoff point method was the superior one because it used data from the majority of subjects included in this study A 57 improvement in pain intensity at its worst and a 28 improvement in pain intensity at its average were the MCIDs for patients with facial pain A greater improvement was needed to achieve the MCID for interference with general and facial ADL A 75 improvement in interference with general ADL and a 62 improvement in interference with facial ADL were needed to achieve an MCID While pain intensity is easier to measure pain interference with ADL may be more important for patient outcomes when designing or evaluating interventions in the field

Bale 2013 33 17 Abstract Hedonic overconsumption contributing to obesity involves altered activation within the mesolimbic dopamine system Dysregulation of dopamine signaling in the nucleus accumbens shell NAS has been implicated in behaviors such as binge eating which contributes to treatment resistance in obesity Wise 2012 Direct modulation of the NAS with deep brain stimulation DBS a surgical procedure currently under investigation in humans for the treatment of major depression disorder and addiction may also be effective in ameliorating binge eating Therefore we examined the ability of DBS of the NAS to block this behavior in mice immunoreactivity was assessed as a marker of neuronal activation NAS DBS was found to reduce binge eating and increased levels in this region DBS of the dorsal striatum had no influence on this behavior demonstrating anatomical specificity for this effect The dopamine D2 receptor antagonist raclopride attenuated the action of DBS whereas the D1 receptor antagonist was ineffective suggesting that dopamine signaling involving D2 receptors underlies the effect of NAS DBS To determine the potential translational relevance to the obese state chronic NAS DBS was also examined in obese mice and was found to acutely reduce caloric intake and induce weight loss Together these findings support the involvement of the mesolimbic dopamine

Identification of the epidermal growth factor receptor variant III EGFRvIII mutation in glioblastoma has become increasingly relevant in the optimization of therapy Traditionally determination of tumor has relied on diagnostics Here we assess the accuracy of magnetic resonance imaging in discriminating the glioblastoma subtype We analyzed RNA from 132 primary human glioblastoma tissue samples by polymerase chain reaction for the EGFRvIII and EGFR mutations and by quantitative for expression of vascular endothelial growth factor VEGF Concurrently 3 independent observers reviewed preoperative T or T MR perfusion images to determine the maximum relative tumor blood volume rTBV of each of these tumors glioblastomas showed significantly higher rTBV compared with those tumors lacking EGFRvIII expression This association was observed in both the P and P cohorts By logistic regression analysis combining the 2 MR system cohorts rTBV was a very strong predictor of EGFRvIII mutation odds ratio rTBV P McFadden ρ 2 Furthermore by characteristic curve analysis rTBV discriminated EGFRvIII with very high accuracy A z In addition we found that VEGF upregulation was associated although without reaching statistical significance with EGFRvIII expression P and with increased rTBV P These trends suggest that angiogenesis may be a potential mediator of angiogenesis to increase perfusion in glioblastomas but there are likely several other contributing factors This study demonstrates the potential to use rTBV a parameter as a noninvasive surrogate of the EGFRvIII mutation

success rate at which DBS would be equivalent to the two most common bariatric searches were performed for studies of laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding LAGB laparoscopic gastric bypass LRYGB and DBS for movement disorders Bariatric surgery was considered successful if postoperative excess weight loss exceeded 45 at Using complication and success rates from the literature the authors constructed a decision analysis model for treatment by LAGB LRYGB DBS or no surgical treatment A sensitivity analysis in which major parameters were systematically varied within their 95 CIs was studies involving 3489 and 3306 cases of LAGB and LRYGB respectively and 45 studies involving 2937 cases treated with DBS were included The operative successes were 95 CI for LAGB and 95 CI for LRYGB Sensitivity analysis revealed utility of surgical complications in LRYGB probability of surgical complications in DBS and success rate of DBS as having the greatest influence on outcomes At no values did LAGB result in superior outcomes compared with other brain stimulation must achieve a success rate of 83 to be equivalent to bariatric surgery This success rate is probably due to the reported

The addition of subcutaneous heparin SQH to mechanical prophylaxis for venous thromboembolism VTE involves a balance between the benefit of greater protection from VTE and the added risk of intracranial hemorrhage There is evidence that the hemorrhage risk outweighs the benefits for patients undergoing craniotomy We investigated the safety of SQH in patients undergoing deep brain stimulation DBS retrospective analysis was performed of all patients with movement disorders n 254 undergoing DBS surgery at our institution from 2003 to 2007 Before September 2005 none of the patients undergoing DBS received SQH group n 121 Thereafter all patients were administered SQH perioperatively SQH group n 133 All patients wore graduated compression stockings and pneumatic compression boots postoperatively in bed A postoperative brain magnetic resonance imaging scan was obtained on the day of of 133 SQH patients and 1 of 121 patients developed asymptomatic intracranial hemorrhage None of the SQH patients developed clinically significant VTE whereas 3 patients developed VTE 1 deep venous thrombosis 2 pulmonary embolisms Using a model we have shown that the use of SQH plus mechanical prophylaxis together yielded outcomes at least as good as mechanical prophylaxis findings suggest that SQH for VTE prophylaxis in patients with movement disorders undergoing DBS surgery is safe SQH protects against VTE in this patient population and merits further investigation View details for DOI View details for Web of Science ID 000268523200013 View details for PubMedID

Baltuch 2009 24 5 Abstract Parkinson disease PD is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by significant motor dysfunction and various disturbances including cognitive alterations Deep brain stimulation DBS is an increasingly utilized therapeutic option for patients with PD that yields remarkable success in alleviating disabling motor symptoms DBS has additionally been associated with changes in cognition yet the evidence is not consistent across studies The following review sought to provide a clearer understanding of the various cognitive sequelae of bilateral subthalamic nucleus STN DBS while taking into account corresponding neuroanatomy and potential confounding literature search was performed using the following inclusion criteria 1 at least five subjects followed for a mean of at least 3 months after surgery 2 and postoperative cognitive data using at least one standardized measure 3 adequate report of study results using means and standard recent found mild impairments in verbal learning and executive function in patients who underwent DBS surgery However studies have revealed improved working memory and psychomotor speed in the vs stimulation state A deficit in language may be a consequence of the surgical cognitive decline has been observed in some domains our review of the data suggests that STN DBS is a worthwhile and safe method to treat PD

evaluation This task is especially difficult in patients who are not clinically able to be evaluated unevaluable because of distracting painful injuries intoxication or concomitant head injury For this population the appropriate use of advanced imaging techniques for cervical spinal clearance remains undetermined This study was undertaken to estimate the prevalence of unstable CSI particularly among patients in whom clinical evaluation is impossible or of the prevalence of CSI in populations consisting of all trauma patients alert patients only and clinically unevaluable patients only were determined by pooling of data from 65 publications patients that met criteria for overall prevalence of CSI among all trauma patients was The prevalence of CSI in alert patients was whereas unevaluable patients were at increased risk of CSI with a prevalence of p Overall of all CSI cases were considered to exhibit patients who are clinically unevaluable have a higher prevalence of CSI than alert patients Knowledge of the prevalence and risk of such injuries may help establish an approach to the detection and management of clinically occult CSI View details for DOI View details for

Baltuch 2008 109 4 Abstract Obesity is a growing global health problem frequently intractable to current treatment options Recent evidence suggests that deep brain stimulation DBS may be effective and safe in the management of various refractory neuropsychiatric disorders including obesity The authors review the literature implicating various neural regions in the pathophysiology of obesity as well as the evidence supporting these regions as targets for DBS in order to explore the therapeutic promise of DBS in obesity The lateral hypothalamus and ventromedial hypothalamus are the appetite and satiety centers in the brain respectively Substantial data support targeting these regions with DBS for the purpose of appetite suppression and weight loss However reward sensation associated with highly caloric food has been implicated in overconsumption as well as obesity and may in part explain the failure rates of conservative management and bariatric surgery Thus regions of the brain reward circuitry such as the nucleus accumbens are promising alternatives for DBS in obesity control The authors conclude that deep brain stimulation should be strongly considered as a promising therapeutic option for patients suffering from refractory obesity View details for DOI View details for Web of Science ID 000259549100006 View details for PubMedID 18826348 contributions to the

dopamine receptor genes DRD2 and DRD4 and maternal sensitivity as predictors of infant respiratory sinus arrhythmia RSA and RSA reactivity purported indices of vagal tone and vagal regulation in a challenge task at 3 6 and 12 months in 173 dyads Hierarchical linear modeling HLM revealed that at 3 and 6 months RSA withdrawal in response to maternal separation was greater suggesting expected physiological regulation in infants without the DRD2 risk allele than those with the risk allele At 12 months infants with the risk allele who were also exposed to maternal sensitivity showed levels of RSA withdrawal comparable to infants who were not at genetic risk Findings demonstrate the importance of developmental analysis of interaction View details for Web of Science ID 000259270200011

several possible mechanisms In traumatic brain injury TBI the principal process involves the release of tissue factor TF There is no agreement how common this mechanism is following general trauma Furthermore when coagulopathy occurs it is unknown whether the source of TF TBI or extracranial trauma influences the course of coagulopathy We undertook this investigation to address both questions The temporal course of prothrombin times PTs were recorded in a group n 441 with isolated TBI head Abbreviated Injury Scale AIS 3 AIS 3 and a group n 101 with extracranial trauma AIS 3 head AIS 3 Data were arranged according to preset time intervals after injury The PT values in both groups were elevated and not significantly different for the first 12 h after trauma Values then fell to normal in TBI patients but remained elevated in injury Traumatic coagulopathy can be explained at least in part by TF release into the general circulation with activation of the coagulation cascade in both TBI and We hypothesize that the different time courses of coagulopathy represented by PT values in these populations were due to reconstitution of the barrier although further investigation is warranted Peripheral hematologic studies may not reflect persistent coagulopathy in cerebral circulation View details for DOI View details for Web of Science ID 000258895700005 View details for PubMedID

resective brain surgery Success of deep brain stimulation DBS in relieving a significant number of symptoms of various movement disorders paved the way for investigations into this modality for epilepsy and small blinded trials have provided promising evidence for the use of DBS in refractory seizures and the first randomized control trial of DBS of the anterior thalamic nucleus is currently underway There are multiple potential targets because many neural regions have been implicated in seizure propagation Thus it is difficult as yet to make any definitive judgments about the efficacy of DBS for seizure control Future study is necessary to identify a patient population for whom this technique would be indicated the most efficacious target and optimal stimulation parameters View

patients with epilepsy suffer from persistent seizures despite maximal antiepileptic drug AED therapy Chronic intermittent vagus nerve stimulation VNS has proven to be a safe effective option for patients suffering from refractory seizures who are not candidates for surgical resection Although only a small minority of patients will be entirely VNS as an adjunct to medical therapy does appear to provide a significant amount of improvement in quality of life Reports of antidepressant effects independent of seizure control along with the use of multiple AEDs in the treatment of depression has led to the investigation of VNS as a potential adjunctive treatment for major depressive disorder Both the number of severely depressed patients refractory to available pharmacologic options and the need for repeated treatments and significant side effects associated with electroconvulsive therapy have heightened the interest in VNS for this patient population Pilot studies of VNS for depression have shown impressive response rates however the effect appears to be gradual in onset as demonstrated by the lack of a favorable response in a randomized controlled study Investigation is thus needed to establish the potential role of VNS as an adjunctive treatment for severe depression View details for Web of Science ID 000252532300009 View details for PubMedID 18164486 Brain shift during deep brain stimulation surgery for Parkinson disease STEREOTACTIC AND FUNCTIONAL NEUROSURGERY Halpern Danish Baltuch Jaggi 2008 86 1 Abstract Brain shift may occur during deep brain stimulation DBS surgery which may affect the position of subcortical structures compromising target retrospectively evaluated and postoperative magnetic resonance imaging in 50 Parkinson disease patients who underwent bilateral subthalamic nucleus STN DBS Patients were separated into two groups group A those with 2 mm cortical displacement 66 leads and group B those with mm cortical displacement 34 leads Pre and coordinates of anterior AC and posterior commissures PC as well as the boundaries of red nucleus RN were shortening due to posterior displacement of AC correlated with cortical displacement p and was significantly greater in group B mm than A mm p Posterior shift of AC and RN center positively correlated p Shift appeared to impact the number of microelectrode tracks made to optimize STN targeting shortening also correlated with age p and duration of surgery p structures shift during DBS surgery This shift appears to be since structures only shifted posteriorly and patients were primarily in the supine position Posterior shift of RN may indicate STN displacement Such positional change may compromise target localization requiring multiple microelectrode adjustments This may provide indirect justification for the necessity of microelectrode recordings during DBS surgery View details for DOI View details for Web of Science ID 000251662700004 View details for PubMedID

focused particularly on knowledge of very small numbers where there is a precise relationship between a cardinality and its number concept but little hypothesized role for verbal mediation We evaluated accuracy and reaction time RT for matching dot arrays and Arabic numerals involving smaller and larger cardinalities in patients with CBD frontotemporal dementia FTD and healthy controls CBD were less accurate and slowed at judging smaller Arabic array stimuli compared to FTD patients and controls Moreover only CBD showed longer RTs judging successively larger array pairs among the smaller cardinalities Difficulty judging very small numbers is impaired in CBD suggesting degraded representation of precise number knowledge that does not depend on language functioning View details

RELATED DISORDERS Halpern Hurtig Jaggi Grossman Won Baltuch 2007 13 1 Abstract Deep brain stimulation DBS is an effective surgical therapy for patients with medically intractable Parkinson disease PD and essential tremor ET The purpose of this review is to describe the success of DBS in these two disorders and its promising application in dystonia Tourette Syndrome TS and epilepsy In the last 10 years numerous and outcome studies have demonstrated significant relief to patients with PD and ET A few studies have also reported sustained benefits When successful DBS greatly reduces most of parkinsonian motor symptoms and dyskinesia and it frequently improves patients ability to perform activities of daily living with less encumbrance from motor fluctuations Quality of life is enhanced and many patients are able to significantly reduce the amount of antiparkinsonian medications required to still get good pharmacological benefit Overall adverse effects associated with DBS tend to be transient although and other postoperative complications do occur DBS should be considered the surgical procedure of choice for patients who meet strict criteria with medically intractable PD ET and

knowledge We examined the nature of their number deficit while we tested the hypothesis that comprehension of larger numbers depends in part on verbal mediation We evaluated magnitude judgments and performance on number conservation measures rooted in Piagetian theory in nonaphasic patients with CBD and patients with a fluent form of progressive aphasia known as semantic dementia SD We manipulated the numbers of the arrays and the properties of the stimuli being compared during magnitude judgments and Piagetian conservation measures CBD patients were consistently impaired judging the magnitudes of larger numbers while they had minimal difficulty with smaller numbers magnitudes or 3 By comparison SD patients performed all measures of number knowledge at a ceiling level regardless of number magnitude Neither patient group was significantly impacted by manipulations of the spatial properties of the stimuli CBD patients impairment with larger numbers despite minimal aphasia and SD patients intact performance despite an aphasia challenge the proposal that understanding larger numbers depends on verbal mediation View details for DOI View details for Web of Science

Colcher Grossman 2004 62 7 Abstract Semantic memory is thought to consist of representations of knowledge that may be selectively compromised in patients with neurodegenerative diseases but this has been difficult to demonstrate reliably across object authors evaluated performance on several simple measures requiring number representations including addition and magnitude judgments of single digits and on a task that requires object representations an object naming task in patients with corticobasal degeneration CBD n 13 and semantic dementia SD n 15 They also examined regional cortical atrophy using morphometric analyses of high resolution structural MRI in subgroups of five CBD patients and three SD patients were consistently more impaired on simple addition and magnitude judgment tasks requiring number representations compared to object representations Impaired performance with numbers in CBD was associated with cortical atrophy in right parietal cortex By comparison SD patients demonstrated a greater impairment on a naming task requiring object representations relative to their performance on measures involving number representations This was associated with left anterior temporal cortical cognitive and neuroanatomic dissociations between CBD and SD are consistent with the hypothesis that number and object representations constitute distinct domains in semantic memory and these domains appear to be associated with distinct neural substrates View details for Web of Science ID 000220769300022 View details for PubMedID 15079017 Calculation impairment

frontotemporal dementia FTD and Alzheimer disease AD as well as 17 healthy seniors matched for age and education Our calculation model involves at least three components numerosity combinatorial processes and executive resources such as working memory We assessed addition subtraction multiplication and division involving small numbers small answers and large numbers larger and answers We also assessed dot counting for small numbers and large numbers as well as a measure of working memory All patient groups differed from healthy seniors in oral calculation CBD 36 correct and FTD 65 correct demonstrated a significant overall impairment in oral calculation relative to AD 76 correct CBD 66 correct had more difficulty counting dots overall relative to AD 94 correct and FTD 86 correct consistent with our hypothesis that the calculation deficit in CBD is due in large part to a numerosity deficit FTD had more difficulty relative to AD in their performance of reverse digit span consistent with our hypothesis that FTD patients executive resource limitation contributes to their pattern of calculation impairment View details for DOI 02 View details for Web of Science ID
