Research and Scholarly Interests We are interested in the role of chromatin regulation in development and human cancer Recent studies have show that over 20 of all human cancers have mutations in the subunits of an chromatin regulatory complex we discovered several years ago The genes behave as tumor suppressors and sometimes as oncogenes We hope to understand the fundamental mechanisms used by these complex to prevent same chromatin remodeling complexes are frequently mutated in a variety of human neurologic diseases reflecting their roles in the development of the nervous system It appears that these specialized roles in the nervous system are due to the use of unique neural specific assemblies in the developing human and mouse brain We hope to understand their fundamental mechanism of action through biochemical and genetic approaches in combination with analysis and genome sequencing we are developing new ways of making conditional alleles of mammalian genes using synthetic ligands that we hope will bring about a new fusion of biochemical and genetic approaches to understanding and controlling fundamental biologic processes Recently we have developed an effective way of both

increased mortality caused by mutation in the LSH gene Although LSH belongs to a family of chromatin remodeling proteins it remains unknown how LSH mediates its function on chromatin in vivo Here we use proximity to rapidly recruit LSH to an engineered locus and find that LSH specifically induces and macroH2A2 deposition in an manner Tethering of LSH induces transcriptional repression and silencing is dependent on macroH2A deposition Loss of LSH decreases macroH2A enrichment at repeat sequences and results in transcriptional reactivation Likewise reduction of macroH2A by siRNA interference mimicks transcriptional reactivation analysis confirmed that LSH is a major regulator of macroH2A distribution Tethering of ICF4 mutations fails to induce macroH2A deposition and ICF4 patient cells display reduced macroH2A deposition and transcriptional reactivation supporting a pathogenic role for altered marcoH2A deposition We propose that LSH is a major chromatin modulator of the histone variant macroH2A and that its ability to insert marcoH2A into chromatin and transcriptionally silence is disturbed in the ICF4 syndrome View details for DOI View details for PubMedID

Krokhotin Shalizi Crabtree 2020 Abstract The chromatin remodeler CHD8 is among the most frequently mutated genes in autism spectrum disorder ASD CHD8 has a role in ASD but when and how it becomes critical to human social function is unclear Here we conducted genomic analyses of heterozygous and homozygous Chd8 mouse embryonic stem cells and differentiated neural progenitors We identify CHD8 transcriptional targets sites of regulated accessibility and an unexpected cooperation with SOX transcription factors Collectively our findings reveal that CHD8 negatively regulates expression of neuronal genes to maintain pluripotency and also during differentiation Thus CHD8 is essential for both the maintenance of pluripotency and neural differentiation providing mechanistic insight into its function with potential implications for ASD View details for DOI View details for PubMedID 32839322 Loss of the BAF subunit ACTL6B relieves repression of early response genes and causes recessive

Shipony Linker Marchetto Gage Chen Sultan Zaki Ranish J Miyakawa Luo Malenka Crabtree Gleeson 2020 Abstract Synaptic activity in neurons leads to the rapid activation of genes involved in mammalian behavior chromatin remodelers such as the BAF complex contribute to these responses and are generally thought to activate transcription However the mechanisms keeping such early activation genes silent have been a mystery In the course of investigating Mendelian recessive autism we identified six families with segregating mutations in the neuronal BAF nBAF subunit ACTL6B originally named BAF53b Accordingly ACTL6B was the most significantly mutated gene in the Simons Recessive Autism Cohort At least 14 subunits of the nBAF complex are mutated in autism collectively making it a major contributor to autism spectrum disorder ASD Patient mutations destabilized ACTL6B protein in neurons and rerouted dendrites to the wrong glomerulus in the fly olfactory system Humans and mice lacking ACTL6B showed corpus callosum hypoplasia indicating a conserved role for ACTL6B in facilitating neural connectivity Actl6b knockout mice on two genetic backgrounds exhibited behaviors including social and memory impairments repetitive behaviors and hyperactivity Surprisingly mutation of Actl6b relieved repression of early response genes including AP1 transcription factors Fos Fosl2 Fosb and Junb increased chromatin accessibility at AP1 binding sites and transcriptional changes in late response genes associated with early response transcription factor activity ACTL6B loss is thus an important

produced by combinatorial assembly that are mutated in and thought to contribute to 20 of human cancers and a large number of neurologic diseases The functions of BAF complexes are essential for viability of many cell types limiting the development of small molecule inhibitors To circumvent the potential toxicity of inhibition we identified small molecules that inhibit the specific repressive function of these complexes but are relatively nontoxic and importantly synergize with ATR inhibitors in killing cancer cells Our studies suggest an avenue for therapeutic enhancement of inhibition

chemotherapy but are associated with substantial Because anthracyclines work in part by inhibiting TOP2 on accessible we hypothesized that chromatin regulatory genes CRGs that mediate DNA accessibility might predict anthracycline response We studied the role of CRGs in anthracycline sensitivity in breast cancer through integrative analysis of patient and cell line data We identified a consensus set of 38 CRGs associated with anthracycline response across ten cell line datasets By evaluating the interaction between expression and treatment in predicting survival in a metacohort of 1006 patients with breast cancer we identified 54 CRGs whose expression levels dictate anthracycline benefit across the clinical subgroups of these CRGs 12 overlapped with those identified in vitro CRGs that promote DNA accessibility including Trithorax complex members were associated with anthracycline sensitivity when highly expressed whereas CRGs that reduce accessibility such as Polycomb complex proteins were associated with decreased anthracycline sensitivity We show that KDM4B modulates TOP2 accessibility to chromatin elucidating a mechanism of TOP2 inhibitor sensitivity These findings indicate that CRGs mediate anthracycline benefit by altering DNA accessibility with implications for the stratification of patients with breast cancer and treatment decision making View

Methylation Patterns over the Genome Molecular cell Chory Calarco Hathaway Bell Neel Crabtree 2018 Abstract Recent studies have indicated that nucleosome turnover is rapid occurring several times per cell cycle To access the effect of nucleosome turnover on theepigenetic landscape we investigated H3K79 methylation which is produced by a single methyltransferase Dot1l with no known demethylase Using proximity CIP we find that the valency of H3K79 methylation and is determined by nucleosome turnover rates Furthermore propagation of this mark is predicted by nucleosome turnover simulations over the genome and accounts for the asymmetric distribution of H3K79me toward the transcriptional unit More broadly a of other conserved histone modifications demonstrates that nucleosome turnover models predict both valency and chromosomal propagation of methylation marks Based on data from worms flies and mice we propose that the turnover of modified nucleosomes is a general means of propagation of epigenetic marks and a determinant of methylation valence View details for PubMedID 30472189 Rapid chromatin repression by Aire provides precise control of immune tolerance NATURE IMMUNOLOGY Koh Miller Buenrostro Moskowitz Wang Greenleaf Chang Crabtree 2018 19 2 Abstract Aire mediates the expression of antigens in thymic epithelial cells to promote tolerance against T lymphocytes However the mechanism that allows expression of genes at levels that prevent harm is unknown Here we show that Brg1 generates accessibility at loci to impose central tolerance We found that Aire has an intrinsic repressive function that restricts chromatin accessibility and opposes Brg1 across the genome Aire exerted this repressive influence within minutes after recruitment to chromatin and restrained the amplitude of active transcription mutations that impair activation also impair the repressive function which indicates dual roles for Aire Together Brg1 and Aire the expression of genes at levels that prevent toxicity yet promote immune tolerance View details for PubMedID 29335648 Chemically induced proximity in biology and medicine Science New York Stanton B Chory Crabtree 2018 359 6380 Abstract Proximity or the physical closeness of molecules is a pervasive regulatory mechanism in biology For example most posttranslational modifications such as phosphorylation methylation and acetylation promote proximity of molecules to play deterministic roles in cellular processes To understand the role of proximity in biologic mechanisms chemical inducers of proximity CIPs were developed to synthetically model biologically regulated recruitment Chemically induced proximity allows for precise temporal control of transcription signaling cascades chromatin regulation protein folding localization and degradation as well as a host of other biologic processes A systematic analysis of CIPs in basic research coupled with recent technological advances utilizing CRISPR distinguishes roles of causality from coincidence and allows for mathematical modeling in synthetic biology Recently induced proximity has provided new avenues of gene

Wang Leighty de Crignis Maschinot Gatchalian Carter Chowdhury Hargreaves Duvall Crabtree Mahmoudi Dykhuizen 2018 Abstract The persistence of a pool of latently cells despite combination therapy treatment is the major roadblock for a cure The BAF mammalian chromatin remodeling complex is involved in establishing and maintaining viral latency making it an attractive drug target for latency reversal Here we report a screen for inhibitors of transcription in cells and the subsequent identification of a macrolactam This compound binds BAF complexes prevents nucleosomal positioning and relieves transcriptional repression of Through this mechanism these compounds are able to reverse latency in an in vitro T cell line an ex vivo primary cell model of latency and in patient T cells without toxicity or T cell activation These macrolactams represent a class of latency reversal agents with unique mechanism of action and can be combined with other latency reversal agents to improve

effects of SMARCA4 missense mutations have remained uncertain Here we show that SMARCA4 cancer missense mutations target conserved ATPase surfaces and disrupt the mechanochemical cycle of remodeling We find that heterozygous expression of mutants alters the open chromatin landscape at thousands of sites across the genome Loss of DNA accessibility does not directly overlap with Polycomb accumulation but is enriched in A compartments at active enhancers which lose H3K27ac but not H3K4me1 Affected positions include hundreds of sites identified as superenhancers in many tissues mutation induces expression changes including increased expression of Myc and its target genes Together our data suggest that disruption of enhancer accessibility represents a key source of altered function in

EPIGENETICS Ren Hathaway Crabtree Muegge 2018 13 2 Abstract Lsh is a chromatin remodeling factor that regulates DNA methylation and chromatin function in mammals The dynamics of these chromatin changes and whether they are directly controlled by Lsh remain unclear To understand the molecular mechanisms of Lsh chromatin controlled regulation of gene expression we established a tethering system that recruits a fusion protein to an engineered Oct4 locus through Gal4 binding sites in murine embryonic stem ES cells We examined the molecular epigenetic events induced by Lsh binding including histone modification DNA methylation and chromatin accessibility to determine nucleosome occupancy before and after embryonic stem cell differentiation Our results indicate that Lsh assists gene repression upon binding to the Oct4 promoter region Furthermore we detected less chromatin accessibility and reduced active histone modifications at the tethered site in undifferentiated ES while GFP reporter gene expression and DNA methylation patterns remained unchanged at this stage Upon differentiation association of Lsh promotes transcriptional repression of the reporter gene accompanied by the increase of repressive histone marks and a gain of DNA methylation at distal and proximal Oct4 enhancer sites Taken together this approach allowed us to examine Lsh mediated epigenetic regulation as a dynamic process and revealed chromatin accessibility changes as the primary consequence of Lsh function View details for PubMedID 28621576 View details for PubMedCentralID PMC5873361 Rapid and reversible epigenome editing by endogenous chromatin regulators NATURE COMMUNICATIONS Braun Kirkland Chory Husmann Calarco Crabtree 2017 8 560 Abstract Understanding the causal link between epigenetic marks and gene regulation remains a central question in chromatin biology To edit the epigenome we developed the system for rapid and reversible recruitment of endogenous chromatin regulators to specific genomic loci We enhanced the anchor for genome targeting with dimerizing fusion proteins to allow proximity of a desired chromatin regulator We find that BAF complex recruitment is sufficient to oppose Polycomb within minutes leading to activation of bivalent gene transcription in mouse embryonic stem cells Furthermore heterochromatin complex recruitment to active promoters deposits H3K9me3 domains resulting in gene silencing that can be reversed upon washout of the chemical dimerizer This inducible recruitment strategy provides precise kinetic information to model epigenetic memory and plasticity It is broadly applicable to mechanistic studies of chromatin in mammalian cells and is particularly suited to the analysis of endogenous chromatin regulator the link between epigenetic marks and gene regulation requires the development of new tools to directly manipulate chromatin Here the authors demonstrate a system to recruit chromatin remodelers to loci of interest allowing rapid reversible manipulation of epigenetic states View details for PubMedID 28916764 Chd8 Mutation Leads to Behaviors and Impaired Striatal Circuits CELL REPORTS Platt Zhou

entry point to studying the molecular underpinnings of this disorder We generated germline mutant mice with mutations in Chd8 a de novo mutation strongly associated with ASD and demonstrate that these mice display hallmark ASD behaviors macrocephaly and craniofacial abnormalities similar to patient phenotypes Chd8 mice display a broad dysregulation of major regulatory and cellular processes most notably histone and chromatin modification mRNA and protein processing Wnt signaling and regulation We also find altered synaptic physiology in medium spiny neurons of the nucleus accumbens Perturbation of Chd8 in adult mice recapitulates improved acquired motor learning behavior found in Chd8 animals suggesting a role for CHD8 in adult striatal circuits These results support a mechanism

complexes couple the energy released from ATP hydrolysis to facilitate transcription recombination and repair mechanisms essential for a wide variety of biologic responses While recombinant expression of the regulatory subunits of these enzymes is possible measuring catalytic ATPase activity of the intact complexes recovered from normal or mutant cells is critical for understanding their mechanisms remodeling complexes can be megadaltons in size and include many regulatory subunits making reconstitution of purified subunits challenging for recapitulating in vivo function The protocol in this article defines the first highly quantitative ATPase assay for intact remodeling complexes that does not require radiation or reconstitution of recombinantly expressed subunits This protocol is

Kadoch Chang Calarco Hodges Buenrostro Cui Greenleaf Zhao Crabtree 2017 Abstract The resolution and formation of facultative heterochromatin are essential for development reprogramming and oncogenesis The mechanisms underlying these changes are poorly understood owing to the difficulty of studying heterochromatin dynamics and structure in vivo We devised an in vivo approach to investigate these mechanisms and found that topoisomerase II TOP2 but not TOP1 synergizes with BAF chromatin remodeling complexes to resolve facultative heterochromatin to accessible chromatin independent of transcription This indicates that changes in DNA topology that take place through catenation rather than the release of torsional stress through swiveling are necessary for heterochromatin resolution TOP2 and BAF cooperate to recruit pluripotency factors which explains some of the instructive roles of BAF complexes Unexpectedly we found that TOP2 also plays a role in the of facultative heterochromatin this finding suggests that facultative heterochromatin and accessible chromatin exist at different states of catenation or other topologies which might be critical to their structures

Pulice Chory Crabtree 2017 49 2 Abstract The opposition between Polycomb repressive complexes PRCs and BAF complexes has a critical role in both development and disease Mutations in the genes encoding BAF subunits contribute to more than 20 of human malignancies yet the underlying mechanisms remain unclear owing largely to a lack of assays to assess BAF function in living cells To address this we have developed a widely applicable recruitment assay system through which we find that BAF opposes PRC by rapid eviction leading to the formation of accessible chromatin The reversal of this process results in reassembly of facultative heterochromatin Surprisingly PRC eviction occurs in the absence of RNA polymerase II Pol II occupancy transcription and replication Further we find that and oncogenic mutant BAF complexes have different effects on PRC eviction The results of these studies define a mechanistic sequence underlying the resolution and formation of facultative heterochromatin and they demonstrate that BAF opposes PRC on a basis to provide epigenetic plasticity View details for DOI View details for Web of Science ID 000393148600010 View details for PubMedID 27941796 Smarca4 ATPase mutations disrupt direct eviction of PRC1 from chromatin NATURE GENETICS Stanton B Hodges Calarco Braun Ku Kadoch Zhao Crabtree 2017 49 2 Abstract proteins and their mammalian homologs including those in BAF complexes are known to oppose the activity of Polycomb repressive complexes PRCs This opposition underlies the role of BAF subunits and is expected to contribute to neurodevelopmental disorders However the mechanisms underlying opposition to Polycomb silencing are poorly understood Here we report that recurrent mutations in BAF subunits induce increases in PRC deposition and activity We show that point mutations in SMARCA4 also known as BRG1 mapping to the ATPase domain cause loss of direct binding between BAF and PRC1 that occurs independently of chromatin Release of this direct interaction is ATP dependent consistent with a transient eviction mechanism Using a new proximity assay we find that BAF directly evicts Polycomb factors within minutes of its occupancy thereby establishing a new mechanism for the widespread opposition underlying development and disease View details for DOI View details for Web of Science ID 000393148600018 View details for PubMedID 27941795 The subunit of chromatin remodeling complexes is essential for hematopoietic stem cell maintenance Experimental hematology Krasteva Crabtree Lessard J A 2017 48 Abstract The ability of hemopoietic stem cells to and differentiate into downstream lineages is dependent on specialized chromatin environments that establish and maintain patterns of gene expression However the epigenetic factors responsible for mediating these regulatory events remain poorly defined Here we provide evidence that a subunit of chromatin remodeling complexes is essential for adult hemopoietic stem cell maintenance and myeloid lineage development Deletion of BAF45a in the mouse is embryonic lethal Acute deletion of BAF45a in the adult hemopoietic system causes a decrease in the frequency of repopulating hemopoietic stem cells and committed myeloid progenitors without affecting their rate of proliferation hemopoietic stem cells and myeloid progenitors are selectively lost from mixed bone marrow chimeras indicating their impaired function even in an intact microenvironment Together these studies suggest that the BAF45a subunit of chromatin remodeling complexes plays nonredundant and

Ronan Farrell Varzavand Johnson Gu Crabtree Musselman A 2017 8 16080 Abstract BRG1 and BRM central components of the BAF chromatin remodelling complex are critical in chromatin structure regulation Here we show that the human BRM hBRM bromodomain BRD has moderate specificity for H3K14ac Surprisingly we also find that both BRG1 and hBRM BRDs have activity We demonstrate that the BRDs associate with DNA through a surface basic patch and that the BRD and an adjacent make multivalent contacts with DNA leading to robust affinity and moderate specificity for elements Although we show that the BRDs can bind to both DNA and H3K14ac simultaneously the activity does not contribute substantially to nucleosome targeting in vitro In addition we find that neither BRD histone nor DNA binding contribute to the global chromatin affinity of BRG1 in mouse embryonic stem cells Together our results suggest that association of the BRD with nucleosomes plays a regulatory rather than targeting role in BAF activity View details for PubMedID 28706277 View details for PubMedCentralID PMC5519978 The BAF chromatin remodelling complex is an epigenetic regulator of lineage specification in the early mouse embryo Development Panamarova Cox Wicher Butler Bulgakova Jeon Rosen Seong Skarnes Crabtree 2016 143 8 Abstract Dynamic control of gene expression is essential for the development of a totipotent zygote into an embryo with defined cell lineages The accessibility of genes responsible for cell specification to transcriptional machinery is dependent on chromatin remodelling complexes such as the BAF complex However the role of the BAF complex in early mouse development has remained unclear Here we demonstrate that BAF155 a major BAF complex subunit regulates the assembly of the BAF complex in vivo and regulates lineage specification of the mouse blastocyst We find that associations of BAF155 with other BAF complex subunits become enriched in lineages just prior to implantation This enrichment is attributed to decreased mobility of BAF155 in compared with embryonic lineages Downregulation of BAF155 leads to increased expression of the pluripotency marker Nanog and its ectopic expression in lineages whereas upregulation of BAF155 leads to the upregulation of differentiation markers Finally we show that the arginine methyltransferase CARM1 methylates BAF155 which differentially influences assembly of the BAF complex between the lineages and the expression of pluripotency markers Together our results indicate a novel role of chromatin remodelling in mouse development via regulation of lineage specification View details for DOI View details for PubMedID 26952987 View details for PubMedCentralID PMC4852518 The Many Roles of BAF and PBAF Complexes in

frequency of mutations in the genes encoding the subunits of chromatin remodelers in human cancer Most of these mutations are within the genes encoding subunits of the BAF factors or complex which is one of two dozen predicted chromatin remodeling complexes in mammals Considering BAF complexes as a single entity the 15 subunits encoded by 29 genes are mutated in 20 of human cancer across a broad range of tumor types These observations demonstrate that there is little redundancy in the oncogenic function of BAF complexes with the other remodeling complexes underscoring their unique roles Several important conclusions emerge from these genomic data specific subunits appear to be mutated in specific cancers highlighting protective roles mutations can function as tumor suppressors or oncogenes mutations can be homozygous or more commonly heterozygous implying their roles in an unknown yet fundamental process used to suppress the genesis of cancer These new human genetic findings paired with biochemical studies are challenging old ideas on how chromatin remodeling complexes function generating new hypotheses with respect to their normal and oncogenic mechanisms and

different than any other cell type These include the fact that several hundred types of neurons exist each requiring specialized patterns of gene expression and in turn specialized chromatin landscapes In addition neurons have the most stable morphology of any cell type a unique feature essential for memory Yet these stable morphologies must allow the emergence of new stable morphologies in response to environmental influences permitting learning to occur by altered morphology and new synapse formation Several years ago we found that neurons have specific chromatin remodeling mechanisms not present in any other cell type that are produced by combinatorial assembly of chromatin remodeling complexes The neural specific subunits are essential for normal neural development learning and memory Remarkably recreating these neural specific complexes in fibroblasts leads to their conversion to neurons Recently the subunits of these complexes have been found to have genetically dominant roles in several human neurologic diseases The genetic dominance of these mutations suggests that less severe mutations will contribute to phenotypic variation in human neuronally

Goetz 2013 13 4 Abstract Numerous transcriptional regulators of neurogenesis have been identified in the developing and adult brain but how neurogenic fate is programmed at the epigenetic level remains poorly defined Here we report that the transcription factor Pax6 directly interacts with the BAF complex in adult neural progenitors Deletion of either Brg1 or Pax6 in the subependymal zone SEZ causes the progeny of adult neural stem cells to convert to the ependymal lineage within the SEZ while migrating neuroblasts convert to different glial lineages en route to or in the olfactory bulb OB analyses reveal that the majority of genes downregulated in the Brg1 null SEZ and OB contain Pax6 binding sites and are also downregulated in Pax6 null SEZ and OB Downstream of the complex we find that Sox11 Nfib and Pou3f4 form a transcriptional network that drives neurogenesis and can convert postnatal glia into neurons Taken together elements of our work identify a tripartite effector

progenitors divide generate progeny that exit mitosis and then migrate to sites where they elaborate specific morphologies and synaptic connections Mitotic exit in neurons is accompanied by an essential switch in chromatin regulatory complexes from the neural progenitor factor npBAF to nBAF complexes that is in part driven by and Recapitulating this switch in fibroblasts leads to their direct conversion to neurons We have defined the kinetics of BAF complex assembly in the formation of induced neurons from mouse embryonic stem cells human fibroblasts and normal mouse neural differentiation and using proteomic analysis found that this switch also includes the removal of SS18 and its replacement by CREST at mitotic exit We found that switching of chromatin remodeling mechanisms is highly correlated with a broad switch in the use of neurogenic transcription factors of SS18 in neural stem cells causes exit and failure to whereas continued expression of SS18 in neurons blocks dendritic outgrowth underlining the importance of subunit switching Because dominant mutations in BAF subunits underlie widely different human neurologic diseases arising in different

Pfister Cho Zhao Crabtree 2013 497 7451 Abstract Recent studies of human tumours have revealed that subunits of BAF mammalian complexes are mutated in more than 20 of all human malignancies but the mechanisms involved in tumour suppression are unclear BAF complexes are polymorphic assemblies that use energy provided by ATP hydrolysis to regulate transcription through the control of chromatin structure and the placement of Polycomb repressive complex 2 PRC2 across the genome Several proteins dedicated to this multisubunit complex including BRG1 also known as SMARCA4 and BAF250a also known as ARID1A are mutated at frequencies similar to those of recognized tumour suppressors In particular the core ATPase BRG1 is mutated in of childhood medulloblastomas and more than 15 of Burkitt lymphomas Here we show a previously unknown function of BAF complexes in decatenating newly replicated sister chromatids a requirement for proper chromosome segregation during mitosis We find that deletion of Brg1 in mouse cells as well as the expression of BRG1 point mutants identified in human tumours leads to anaphase bridge formation in which sister chromatids are linked by catenated strands of DNA and a block characteristic of the decatenation checkpoint Endogenous BAF complexes interact directly with endogenous topoisomerase IIα TOP2A through BAF250a and are required for the binding of TOP2A to approximately sites across the genome Our results demonstrate that TOP2A chromatin binding is dependent on the ATPase activity of BRG1 which is compromised in oncogenic BRG1 mutants These studies indicate that the ability of TOP2A to prevent DNA entanglement at mitosis requires BAF complexes and suggest that this activity contributes to the role of BAF subunits as tumour

traditionally studied in the context of evolutionarily conserved signaling pathways and neurogenic transcription factors Recent studies suggest that microRNAs a group of highly conserved noncoding regulatory small RNAs also play essential roles in neural development and neuronal function A part of their action in the developing nervous system is to regulate subunit compositions of BAF complexes chromatin remodeling complexes which appear to have dedicated functions during neural development Intriguingly ectopic expression of a set of microRNAs and that promote the assembly of BAF complexes converts the nonneuronal fate of human dermal fibroblasts towards postmitotic neurons thereby revealing a previously unappreciated instructive role of these microRNAs In addition to these global

exactly 78 amino acids of SSX to the SS18 subunit of BAF complexes We demonstrate that the fusion protein competes for assembly with SS18 forming an altered complex lacking the tumor suppressor BAF47 hSNF5 The altered complex binds the Sox2 locus and reverses repression resulting in Sox2 activation Sox2 is uniformly expressed in SS tumors and is essential for proliferation Increasing the

aspects of chromatin structure during many cellular processes The family in particular appears to have undergone a substantial change in subunit composition and mechanism coincident with the evolutionary advent of multicellularity and the appearance of linking histones The differential usage of this greater diversity of mammalian BAF subunits is essential for the development of specific

remarkable advances in understanding these heritable states and the ways that they are initiated or terminated Transcription factors that bind directly to DNA and have sufficiency roles have been most easy to investigate and perhaps for this reason are most solidly implicated in pluripotency In addition large complexes of and enzymes that have specialized functions have also been implicated by genetic studies in initiating maintaining pluripotency or multipotency Several of these remodeling complexes play roles and the esBAF complex facilitates reprogramming of induced pluripotent stem cells The recent finding that virtually all histone modifications can be rapidly reversed and are often highly dynamic has raised new questions about how histone modifications come to play a role in the steady state of pluripotency Another surprise from genetic studies has been the frequency with which the global effects of mutations in chromatin regulators can be largely reversed by a single

Abstract One of the most distinctive steps in the development of the vertebrate nervous system occurs at mitotic exit when cells lose multipotency and begin to develop stable connections that will persist for a lifetime This transition is accompanied by a switch in mechanisms that appears to coincide with the final mitotic division of neurons This switch involves the exchange of the BAF53a also known as ACTL6a and BAF45a PHF10 subunits within BAF npBAF complexes for the homologous BAF53b ACTL6b and BAF45b DPF1 subunits within BAF nBAF complexes in neurons The subunits of the npBAF complex are essential for proliferation and mice with reduced dosage for the genes encoding its subunits have defects in closure similar to those in human spina bifida one of the most serious congenital birth defects In contrast BAF53b and the nBAF complex are essential for an evolutionarily conserved program of neural development and dendritic morphogenesis Here we show that this essential transition is mediated by repression of BAF53a by and We find that BAF53a repression is mediated by sequences in the 3 untranslated region corresponding to the recognition sites for and which are selectively

underlying the roles of these complexes is unclear Here we show that BAF complexes are required for the and pluripotency of mouse ES cells but not for the proliferation of fibroblasts or other cells Proteomic studies reveal that ES cells express distinctive complexes esBAF defined by the presence of Brg gene BAF155 and BAF60A and the absence of Brm Brahma BAF170 and BAF60C We show that this specialized subunit composition is required for ES cell maintenance and pluripotency Our proteomic analysis also reveals that esBAF complexes interact directly with key regulators of pluripotency

chromatin remodeling esBAF complexes are indispensable for the maintenance and pluripotency of mouse embryonic stem ES cells Ho L et al 2009 Proc Natl Acad Sci USA To understand the mechanism underlying the roles of these complexes in ES cells we performed mapping of the core ATPase subunit Brg using technology We find that esBAF as represented by Brg binds to genes encoding components of

protein FKBP partitions a modified HIV protease inhibitor into blood cells and prolongs its lifetime in vivo PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA Marinec Chen Barr Mutz Crabtree Gestwicki 2009 106 5 Abstract HIV protease inhibitors are a key component of therapy but their susceptibility to cytochrome P 450 metabolism reduces their systemic availability and necessitates repetitive dosing Importantly failure to maintain adequate inhibitor levels is believed to provide an opportunity for resistance to emerge thus new strategies to prolong the lifetime of these drugs are needed Toward this goal numerous prodrug approaches have been developed but these methods involve creating inactive precursors that require enzymatic processing Using an alternative strategy inspired by the natural product FK506 we have synthetically modified an HIV protease inhibitor such that it acquires high affinity for the abundant cytoplasmic chaperone protein FKBP This modified protease inhibitor maintains activity against protease IC 50 19 nM and additionally it is partitioned into the cellular component of whole blood via binding to FKBP Interestingly redistribution into this protected niche reduces metabolism and improves its in mice by almost compared with the unmodified compound Based on these findings we propose that addition of groups might

by signals originating from the alphabeta receptor interactions between the receptor and complexes direct differentiation to the stage positive selection whereas interactions induce death by apoptosis negative selection Here we show that mice deficient in both calcineurin and nuclear factor of activated T cells NFAT lack a population of preselection thymocytes with enhanced ability to activate the protein kinase pathway and fail to undergo positive selection This defect can be partially rescued with constitutively active Raf indicating that calcineurin controls MAPK signalling Analysis of mice deficient in both Bim which is required for negative selection and calcineurin revealed that ERK extracellular kinase sensitization is required for differentiation in response to positive selecting signals but not in response to negative selecting signals which normally induce apoptosis These results indicate that early signalling produces a developmental period of ERK hypersensitivity allowing very weak signals to induce positive selection This mechanism might be generally useful in the discrimination of graded signals that induce different cell fates View details for DOI View details for

JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY Wu Kao Barrientos Baldwin Olson Crabtree Zhou Chang 2007 282 42 Abstract Patients with Down syndrome have characteristic heart valve lesions resulting from endocardial cushion defects The Down syndrome critical region 1 DSCR1 gene identified at the conserved trisomic 21 region in those patients encodes a calcineurin inhibitor that inactivates nuclear factor of activated T cells NFATc activity Here we identify a regulatory sequence in the promoter region of human DSCR1 that dictates specific expression of a reporter gene in the endocardium defined by the temporal and spatial expression of Nfatc1 during heart valve development Activation of this evolutionally conserved DSCR1 regulatory sequence requires calcineurin and NFATc1 signaling in the endocardium NFATc1 proteins bind to the regulatory sequence and trigger its enhancer activity NFATc1 is sufficient to induce the expression of Dscr1 in cells that normally have undetectable or minimal NFATc1 or DSCR1 Pharmacologic inhibition of calcineurin or genetic Nfatc1 null mutation in mice abolishes the endocardial activity of this DSCR1 enhancer Furthermore in mice lacking endocardial NFATc1

diversity of dendritic patterns is one of the fundamental characteristics of neurons and is in part regulated by transcriptional programs initiated by electrical activity We show that dendritic outgrowth requires a family of combinatorially assembled chromatin remodeling complexes nBAF complexes distinguished by the protein BAF53b and based on the ATPases nBAF complexes bind tightly to the Ca dendritic regulator CREST and directly regulate genes essential for dendritic outgrowth BAF53b is not required for nBAF complex assembly or the interaction with CREST yet is required for their recruitment to the promoters of specific target genes The highly homologous BAF53a protein which is a component of neural progenitor and nonneural BAF complexes can not replace BAF53b role in dendritic development Remarkably we find that this functional specificity is conferred by the actin fold subdomain 2 of BAF53b These studies suggest that the genes encoding the individual subunits of

tryptophan fluorescence during reversible chaotropic denaturation Our results implicate the T2098L point mutation as a key determinant of instability Further we found that some of the mutants in this collection were destabilized by up to 6 kcal mol relative to the wild type To investigate how these mutants behave in cells we expressed firefly luciferase fused to FRB mutants in African green monkey kidney COS cell lines and mouse embryonic fibroblasts MEFs When unstable FRB mutants were used we found that the protein levels and the luminescence intensities were low However addition of a chemical ligand for FRB rapamycin restored luciferase activity Interestingly we found a roughly linear relationship between the Delta G of the FRB mutants calculated in vitro and the relative chemical rescue in cells Because rapamycin is capable of simultaneously binding both FRB and the chaperone protein FKBP we next examined whether FKBP might contribute to the protection of FRB mutants Using both in

are both signal transducers and transcription factors that reside in the cytoplasm until dephosphorylation by calcineurin Dephosphorylation exposes nuclear import sequences and sends NFATc proteins into the nucleus where they assemble with nuclear partners into NFAT transcription complexes Recent genetic studies have indicated that signaling is a major determinant of vertebrate morphogenesis and development Mice lacking calcineurin activity show a complete block in positive selection of CD4 and CD8 thymocytes yet the role of the NFATc proteins in T cell development has been controversial In this study we address the requirement for NFATc3 in T cell development by generating NFATc3 conditional knockout mice We show that specific deletion of NFATc3 in thymocytes causes a partial block at the stage 3 and also a partial block in positive selection Furthermore the defect does not become more pronounced when NFATc2 is also absent consistent with the fact that mice do not have a T cell developmental defect Expression of a nuclear and constitutively active NFATc1 even at subphysiological levels can rescue the transition of to thymocytes in mice but is unable to rescue development of CD4 and CD8 cells In addition to NFATc3 this suggests a role for NFATc1 in T cell development Our studies indicate that the signals that direct positive selection likely use both NFATc1 and NFATc3

syndrome Here we report that two genes DSCR1 and DYRK1A lie within the critical region of human chromosome 21 and act synergistically to prevent nuclear occupancy of NFATc transcription factors which are regulators of vertebrate development We use mathematical modelling to predict that autoregulation within the pathway accentuates the effects of trisomy of DSCR1 and DYRK1A leading to failure to activate NFATc target genes under specific conditions Our observations of mice and mice mouse models of Down syndrome and human trisomy 21 are consistent with these predictions We suggest that the

development of distinct populations of B cells and ultimately the production of plasma cells We studied the role of signaling in B cells by deleting the regulatory b1 subunit of calcineurin specifically in B cells Follicular FO and marginal zone MZ B cells develop normally in these mice but B1 cell numbers are reduced In vitro calcineurin B cells have a proliferation defect downstream of the B cell receptor These mice have higher total serum IgM despite the absence of B1 cells and have enhanced T responses Conversely mice with calcineurin B cells develop larger germinal centers and have reduced plasma cell development and antibody production during T immune responses By several different criteria calcineurin is dispensable for B cell tolerance indicating that this phosphatase

influences the magnitude of gene expression The nuclear factor of activated T cells NFAT group of proteins are critical transcription factors that direct gene expression in immune and nonimmune cells A balance of phosphotransferase activity is necessary for optimal NFAT activation Activation of NFAT requires dephosphorylation by the calcineurin phosphatase to promote NFAT nuclear accumulation and the extracellular kinase ERK protein MAP kinase which targets NFAT partners to potentiate transcription Whether protein kinases operate on NFAT and contribute positively to transcription activation is not clear Here we coupled DNA affinity isolation with kinase assays to avidly pull down the activated NFAT and identify its associated protein kinases We demonstrate that p90 ribosomal S6 kinase RSK is recruited to the transcription complex upon activation The formation of transcription complex is also apparent upon adipogenesis Bound RSK phosphorylates Ser 676 and potentiates NFATc4 DNA binding by escalating association Ser 676 is also targeted by the ERK MAP kinase which interacts with NFAT at a distinct region than RSK Thus integration of the signaling pathway provides a mechanism to

Abstract The delicate leaflets that make up vertebrate heart valves are essential for our existence Abnormalities of valve formation are the most common serious human congenital defect Despite their importance relatively little is known about valve development We show that the initiation of heart valve morphogenesis in mice requires to repress VEGF expression in the myocardium underlying the site of prospective valve formation This repression of VEGF at E9 is essential for endocardial cells to transform into mesenchymal cells Later at E11 a second wave of signaling is required in the endocardium adjacent to the earlier myocardial site of NFAT action to direct valvular elongation and refinement Thus NFAT signaling functions sequentially from myocardium to endocardium within a valvular morphogenetic field to initiate and perpetuate embryonic valve formation This mechanism also operates in zebrafish indicating a conserved role for signaling in vertebrate heart valve

regulator of intracellular responses in eukaryotic cells In higher eukaryotes activation of calcineurin facilitates direct dephosphorylation and nuclear translocation of the transcription factor nuclear factor of activated NFAT Recently controversy has surrounded the role of calcineurin in mediating skeletal muscle cell hypertrophy Here we examined the ability of mice to undergo skeletal muscle hypertrophic growth following mechanical overload MOV stimulation or growth stimulation Two distinct models of calcineurin deficiency were employed calcineurin Abeta mice which show a approximately 50 reduction in total calcineurin and calcineurin mice crossed with a myosin light chain 1f cre allele which show a greater than 80 loss of total calcineurin only in skeletal muscle Calcineurin and calcineurin mice show essentially no defects in muscle growth in response to treatment or MOV stimulation although calcineurin mice show a basal defect in total fiber number in the plantaris and a mild secondary reduction in growth consistent with a developmental defect in myogenesis Both groups of mice show normal increases in Akt activation following MOV or stimulation However switching was dramatically impaired in calcineurin mice reporter transgenic mice failed to show a correlation between or hypertrophy and signaling in vivo We conclude that calcineurin expression is

bifunctional coactivator DCoH dimerization cofactor of HNF1 Strikingly an HNF1alpha deletion in mice causes more severe phenotypes than a DCoH deletion It has been hypothesized that a DCoH homolog DCoH2 partially complements the DCoH deletion To test this idea we determined the biochemical properties and the crystal structure of DCoH2 Like DCoH DCoH2 forms a tetramer displays dehydratase activity and binds HNF1alpha in vivo and in vitro DCoH and DCoH2 adopt identical folds with structural differences confined largely to the protein surfaces and the tetramer interface In contrast to the hyperstable DCoH tetramer DCoH2 readily disproportionates and forms a complex with HNF1 in vitro Phylogenetic analysis reveals six major subfamilies of DCoH proteins including unique DCoH and DCoH2 branches in metazoans These results suggest distinct roles for DCoH and DCoH2 Differences in conserved surface residues could mediate binding to different effectors We propose that HNF1alpha

function is removed by the selective deletion of Cnb1 in the mesenchyme of the developing urinary tract using the system This deletion results in reduced proliferation in the smooth muscle cells and

positive selection while more intense signals give rise to negative selection By deleting the genetic locus encoding the regulatory B1 subunit of calcineurin specifically in thymocytes we found an absolute requirement for calcineurin in positive selection In contrast calcineurin activity was dispensable in several models of negative selection Unexpectedly we found that removal of calcineurin activity from thymocytes results in inefficient ERK activation at the stage of thymocyte development when selection occurs These studies clarify the mechanism by which graded signals are converted to discrete outcomes in T cell development and further indicate that the developmental roles of calcineurin likely contribute to immunosuppression by calcineurin inhibitors View details for Web of

Neurotrophins and netrins stimulate nuclear localization of NFATc4 and activation of gene transcription in cultured primary neurons These data indicate that the ability of these embryonic axons to

cytoplasmic accumulation of in direct opposition to calcineurin by phosphorylating and in the conserved repeat domain and that mutation of these serines blocks the effect of PKA Activation of endogenous PKA is similarly able to promote phosphorylation of these sites on in two lymphoid cell lines We further show that a complete block of nuclear localization by PKA requires a second kinase activity that can be supplied by glycogen synthase and that mutation of either the PKA phosphorylation sites or the upstream sites prevents the effect of PKA Thus we propose that PKA functions

activation of T cells requires effective occupancy of both the T cell receptor and a second coreceptor such as CD28 We used cDNA microarrays to characterize the genomic expression program in human peripheral T cells responding to stimulation of these receptors We found that CD28 agonists alone elicited few but reproducible changes in gene expression whereas CD3 agonists elicited a multifaceted temporally choreographed gene expression program The principal effect of simultaneous engagement of CD28 was to increase the amplitude of the CD3 transcriptional response The induced genes whose expression was most enhanced by costimulation were significantly enriched for known targets of nuclear factor of activated T cells NFAT transcription factors This enhancement was nearly abolished by blocking the nuclear translocation of NFATc by using the calcineurin inhibitor FK506 CD28 signaling promoted phosphorylation and thus inactivation of the NFAT nuclear export kinase glycogen synthase GSK3 coincident with enhanced dephosphorylation of NFATc proteins These results provide a detailed picture of the transcriptional program of T cell activation and suggest that enhancement of

mammalian BAF chromatin remodeling complexes and still more recently other chromatin remodeling complexes in yeast flies and man Although the function of actin in these chromatin remodeling complexes

activities of either the transcriptional activator Gal4 by simple recruitment with synthetic ligands or the transcriptional repressor Mig1 generated graded changes in gene expression that were proportional to signal intensity However in the context of the endogenous signaling pathway these transcription factors formed part of a binary transcriptional response Genetic studies demonstrated that this binary response resulted from regulation of a second repressor Gal80 whereas regulation of Mig1 by a distinct signaling pathway generated graded changes in GAL1 promoter activity Surprisingly isogenetic cells can respond to glucose with either binary or graded changes in gene expression depending on growth conditions Our studies demonstrate that a given promoter can adapt

domains With this objective we have determined the genomic structure of the 14 genes in invertebrates and vertebrates that contain rel domains The sequence encoding the rel domain is defined by intronic boundaries and has been recombined with at least three structurally and functionally distinct genomic sequences to generate coding sequences for i the proteins that are retained in the cytoplasm by proteins ii the NFATc proteins that sense calcium signals and undergo translocation in response to dephosphorylation by calcineurin and iii the TonEBP proteins Remarkably a single exon in each NFATc family member encodes the entire Ca sensing region including nuclear and substrate regions The proteins and the TonEBP proteins are present in Drosophila but not Caenorhabditis elegans On the other hand the NFATc proteins are present only in vertebrates suggesting that the NFATc family is dedicated to functions specific to vertebrates such as a recombinational immune response

with an cell APC several receptor ligand pairs including the T cell receptor TCR histocompatibility complex MHC accumulate at the T interface in defined geometrical patterns This accumulation depends on a movement of the T cell cortical actin cytoskeleton toward the interface Here we study the involvement of the guanine nucleotide exchange factor vav in this process We crossed 129 vav mice with TCR transgenic mice and used APCs to stimulate T cells from the offspring We found that the accumulation of at the T interface and the T cell actin cytoskeleton rearrangement were clearly defective in these vav mice A comparable defect in T cell activation of T cells from transgenic 129 mice was also observed although in this case it was more apparent in vav mice These data indicate that vav is an

We have developed a means of conducting order of addition and experiments in living cells by rapidly exchanging proteins bound to promoters Using this approach we found that following specific disruption of activator function transcription from active promoters decayed slowly persisting through multiple cell divisions This persistent transcriptional activity raised the question of what mechanisms return promoters to inactive states By exchanging or directing of protein complexes bound to a promoter we found that the transcriptional inhibitor lost its effectiveness as a repressor following activator dissociation Similar experiments with another repressor the histone deacetylase reinforced this distinction between repression in the presence and absence of an activator These

6754 Abstract The molecular basis of learning and memory has been the object of several recent advances which have focused attention on pathways controlling transcription One of the molecules implicated by pharmacological biochemical and genetic approaches is the phosphatase calcineurin In lymphocytes calcineurin responds to specific calcium signals and regulates expression of several immediate early genes by controlling the nuclear import of the family of transcription factors Here we show that in hippocampal neurons can rapidly translocate from cytoplasm to nucleus and activate transcription in response to electrical activity or potassium depolarization The translocation is critically dependent on calcium entry through calcium channels can phosphorylate promoting its export from the nucleus and antagonizing transcription Furthermore we show that induction of the inositol receptor type 1 is controlled by the pathway This provides a new perspective on the function of calcineurin in the central nervous system and indicates that gene expression may be involved in the induction of hippocampal synaptic plasticity and memory formation View details for Web of Science ID

obstacle to transcription but two means of overcoming its repressive effects histone acetylation and the activities of the complex have been proposed Histone acetylation and activity have been shown to be crucial for transcriptional induction and to facilitate binding of transcription factors to DNA By regulating the activity of the complex in vivo we found that active transcription requires continuous function demonstrating a role for this complex beyond the induction of transcription Despite the presumably generalized packaging of genes into chromatin previous studies have indicated that the transcriptional requirements for the histone acetyltransferase Gcn5 and the complex are limited to a handful of genes However inactivating function in cells also lacking GCN5 revealed defects in transcription of several genes previously thought to be and These findings suggest that chromatin remodeling plays a widespread role in gene expression and that these two chromatin remodeling

translocation of cytoplasmic to the nucleus was normal reflecting that the lower levels of in cells were still sufficient to activate calcineurin Treatment of lymphocytes with cytochalasin D which blocks actin polymerization inhibited cap formation and produced defects in signaling and transcriptional induction in response to signaling that were nearly identical to those seen in cells In

mechanism by which it is targeted to specific genes is poorly understood and may involve direct DNA binding interactions with specific or general transcription factors We have previously purified a mammalian complex by using antibodies against BRG1 a human homologue of This complex is likely functionally related to the yeast complex because all five subunit identified so far referred to as BAFs

nucleosome Surprisingly complexes with mutations in the HMG domain of BAF57 can still bind 4WJ DNA and mediate nucleosome disruption Our work describes the first DNA binding subunit for complexes and

altered directly using a small molecule that binds to the protein but no general method exists for the systematic discovery of small molecule ligands synthesis provides a means of synthesizing vast numbers of small molecules Synthetic chemists will soon be able to synthesize natural substances by this method so compatible screening methods that detect the activity of minute quantities of

a manner the concentration of ligands that the cells are exposed to can be controlled The spatial segregation of nanodroplets prevents the mixing of compounds from other beads so the effects of each molecule can be assayed individually Second a small genetic selection involving engineered budding yeast cells was used to detect intracellular interactions in technique described here should

physiological levels of ZAP70 with the synthetic ligand FK1012A leads to rapid phosphorylation of ZAP70 and activation of the and signaling pathways ZAP70 SH2 domains are not required for signaling when the kinase is artifically recruited to the membrane indicating that the SH2 domains function solely in recruitment and not in kinase activation Using additional synthetic ligands and their binding proteins that recruit ZAP70 equally well but orient it at the cell membrane in different ways we define a requirement for a specific presentation of ZAP70 to its downstream targets These results provide a mechanism by which ZAP70 bound to the phosphorylated receptor could discriminate between conformational changes induced by the binding of different complexes to the antigen receptor

refer to as factors BAFs ranging from 47 to 250 kD We have isolated cDNAs for human BAF155 BAF170 and BAF60 BAF155 and BAF170 are encoded by separate genes that are both homologs of yeast SWI3 Both contain a region of similarity to the DNA binding domain of myb but lack the basic residues known to be necessary for interaction with DNA The two SWI3 homologs copurify on antibody columns specific for either BAF155 or BAF170 indicating that they are in the same complex BAF60 is encoded by a novel gene family An open reading frame from yeast which is highly homologous encodes the previously uncharacterized subunit of the yeast complex required for transcriptional activation by the glucocorticoid receptor Cairns et this issue BAF60a is expressed in all tissues examined whereas BAF60b and BAF60c are expressed preferentially in muscle and pancreas respectively BAF60a is present within the BRG1 complex whereas BAF60b is in a distinct complex that shares some but not all subunits with the BRG1 complex The observed similarity between mammalian BAF190 BAF170 BAF155 BAF60 and BAF47 and yeast SWI3 SWI3 SWP73 and SNF5 respectively underscores the similarity of the mammalian and yeast

evolutionary conserved signal transduction pathways CsA FK506 and rapamycin bind to their intracellular receptors immunophilins creating composite surfaces that block the activity of specific targets For and the target is calcineurin Because of the large surface area of interaction of the complex with calcineurin FK506 and CsA have a specificity for their biologic targets that is equivalent to growth interactions To date all the therapeutic as well as toxic effects of these drugs have been shown to be due to inhibition of calcineurin Inhibition of the action of calcineurin results in a complete block in the translocation of the cytosolic component of the nuclear factor of activated T cells resulting in a failure to activate the genes regulated by the transcription factor These genes include those required for help such as interleukin and CD40 ligand as well as those necessary for proliferation such as The purpose of this article is to illustrate the means by which these drugs

NATURE Ho Biggar Spencer Schreiber Crabtree 1996 382 6594 Abstract Eukaryotic transcriptional activators mediate transcriptional induction through stabilization of the preinitiation complex probably through direct interactions with basal transcription factors In vitro studies on the role of an activator in the maintenance of transcription reinitiation have been contradictory suggesting that after formation of a preinitiation complex an activator may or may not be necessary for transcription to be maintained We have developed a means of regulating transcription in living cells through the use of both homodimeric and heterodimerizing synthetic ligands that allow the association and disassociation of a transcriptional activation domain with a promoter Here we report that maintaining the transcription of endogenous genes in vivo in both yeast and human cells requires the continuous presence of the activation domain The use of synthetic ligands as a transcriptional switch represents a powerful means of controlling the transcription in vitro and in vivo for both experimental and therapeutic purposes View details for Web of Science ID A1996VE34700051 View details for PubMedID 8752278 Functional analysis of Fas signaling in vivo using synthetic inducers of dimerization CURRENT BIOLOGY Spencer Belshaw Chen Ho Randazzo Crabtree Schreiber 1996 6 7 Abstract Genetic abnormalities in the Fas receptor or its trimeric ligand FasL result in massive proliferation and a autoimmune syndrome which was initially attributed to excessive lymphoproliferation but is now ascribed to the absence of cell death Although Fas is normally expressed on most thymocytes negative selection seems to be unperturbed in lpr mice This suggests that Fas has an important function in peripheral but not thymic T explore the cell death pathway both in vitro and in vivo we used conditional alleles of the Fas receptor that can be triggered by an intracellularly active chemical inducer of dimerization known as FK1012 We found that membrane attachment is important for Fas function and unlike previous results with monoclonal antibodies we show that dimerization is sufficient to trigger apoptosis Finally the administration of FK1012 in vivo to transgenic animals expressing the conditional FAS receptor in thymocytes demonstrates that sensitivity to apoptosis is restricted to we describe the first in vivo application of synthetic ligands to regulate signal transduction in transgenic mice expressing a conditional receptor Using this system we show that the Fas pathway is restricted to thymocytes in vivo

PHYSIOLOGICAL ROLES OF CRAC CHANNELS JOURNAL OF CELL BIOLOGY Fanger Hoth Crabtree Lewis 1995 131 3 Abstract Prolonged influx is an essential signal for the activation of T lymphocytes by antigen This influx is thought to occur through highly selective CRAC channels that are activated by the depletion of intracellular stores We have isolated mutants of the Jurkat human T cell line NZdipA to explore the molecular mechanisms that underlie capacitative entry and to allow a genetic test of the functions of CRAC channels in T cells Five mutant cell lines through were selected based on their failure to express a lethal diphtheria toxin A chain gene and a lacZ reporter gene driven by a Ca and protein kinase transcription factor The rate of influx evoked by thapsigargin was reduced to varying degrees in the mutant cells whereas the dependence of gene transcription on i was unaltered suggesting that the transcriptional defect in these cells is caused by a reduced level of capacitative entry We examined several factors that determine the rate of entry including CRAC channel activity K activity and clearance mechanisms The only parameter found to be dramatically altered in most of the mutant lines was the amplitude of the current ICRAC which ranged from 1 to 41 of that seen in parental control cells In each case the severity of the ICRAC defect was closely correlated with deficits in influx rate and Ca gene transcription Behavior of the mutant cells provides genetic evidence for several roles of ICRAC in T cells First mitogenic doses of ionomycin appear to elevate i primarily by activating CRAC channels Second ICRAC promotes the refilling of empty stores Finally CRAC channels are solely responsible for the influx that underlies T cell activation These mutant cell lines may provide a useful system for isolating expressing and exploring the functions of genes involved in capacitative entry View details for Web of Science ID A1995TC10100009 View details for PubMedID

AMERICA Spencer Graef AUSTIN Schreiber Crabtree 1995 92 21 Abstract The tyrosine kinases require membrane localization for transformation and probably for their normal role in signal transduction We utilized this characteristic to prepare tyrosine kinases that can be readily activated with the rationally designed chemical inducer of dimerization FK1012 Dimerization of cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases was not sufficient for signaling but their recruitment to the plasma membrane led to the rapid activation of transcription factors identical to those regulated by crosslinking the antigen receptor Moreover recruitment of activated kinases to the membrane replaced signaling by the antigen receptor complex leading to the activation of both the kinase C and pathways normally activated by antigen receptor signaling Since these chemical inducers of dimerization are cell permeable this approach permits the production of conditional alleles of any of the tyrosine kinases thereby allowing a delineation of their developmental roles View details for PubMedID 7568222 IN USING A CONDITIONAL ALLELE OF SOS PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA Holsinger Spencer AUSTIN Schreiber Crabtree 1995 92 21 Abstract While Ras activation has been shown to play an important role in signal transduction by the antigen receptor the mechanism of its activation in T cells is unclear Membrane localization of the guanine nucleotide exchange factor Sos but not Vav or Dbl was sufficient for signaling in T lymphocytes Activation of Sos appears to involve membrane recruitment and not allosteric changes because interaction of Sos with the linking molecule was not required for Ras activation To extend this analysis we constructed a modified Sos that could be localized to the membrane inducibly by using a rationally designed chemical inducer of dimerization FK1012 The role of in signaling was mimicked with this technique which induced the association of a modified Sos with the membrane resulting in rapid activation of signaling In contrast inducible localization of to the membrane did not activate signaling and suggests that the interaction of with Sos in T cells is subject to regulation This conditional allele of Sos demonstrates that membrane localization of Sos is sufficient for Ras activation in T cells and indicates that the role of is to realize the biologic advantages of dimerization enhanced specificity and favorable kinetics for signaling This method of generating conditional alleles may also be useful in

thymus and also mediate the immunologic activation of mature peripheral T cells In both cases TCR stimulation leads to the assembly of the NFAT transcription complex as a result of the nuclear translocation of cytosolic subunits NFATc and the kinase induction of a nuclear subunit NFATn To further understand the diverse roles of antigen receptor signaling throughout T cell development we have identified a new NFATc family member NFATc3 that is expressed at highest levels in the thymus NFATc3 is the product of a gene on murine chromosome 8 that is not linked to the other NFATc genes NFATc3 like other NFATc family members contains a conserved rel similarity domain and also defines a region conserved among NFATc family members the SP repeat region characterized by the repeated motif SPxxSPxxSPrxsxx swl NFATc3 activates NFAT transcription when overexpressed yet exhibits a pattern of DNA site specificity distinct from other NFATc proteins Additionally thymic NFATc3 undergoes modifications in response to agents that mimic T cell receptor signaling including a decrease in apparent molecular mass upon elevation of intracellular calcium that is inhibited by the immunosuppressant FK506 Given the preferential expression of NFATc3 in the thymus NFATc family members may regulate distinct subsets of genes during T cell development View details for PubMedID

cDNA cloning of the murine homolog of NFATc and the human homolog of NFATp and the chromosomal localization of both genes in both species to conserved syntenic regions Through the use of mapping panels of human x Chinese hamster and mouse x rodent cells hybrids the NFATc genes were mapped to human and mouse chromosomes 18 By analyzing a chromosome 18 radiation hybrid panel the human NFATc gene was localized to the q terminus closely linked to STS marker D18S497 The murine Nfatc gene was sublocalized to chromosome band 18E4 by FISH The NFATp genes were mapped by somatic cell hybrid

has recently been established as a key signaling enzyme in the T cell signal transduction cascade and an important regulator of transcription factors such as and which are involved in the expression of a number of important T cell early genes CsA and FK506 act by forming complexes with their respective intracellular receptors cyclophilin and FKBP immunophilins which can then bind to CN inhibiting its enzymatic activity and thereby preventing early gene expression CN is comprised of two subunits a catalytic subunit CNA which contains a calmodulin binding domain and autoinhibitory region and a intrinsic calcium binding regulatory subunit CNB In this study we have utilized a series of deletion mutants of the CNA subunit to investigate the subunit and molecular requirements that govern the interaction of CN with complexes The calmodulin binding and autoinhibitory domains of the CNA subunit were found to be dispensable for the binding of CN to complexes In contrast we found that the regulatory CNB subunit appears to play an obligatory role in this interaction and have defined an amino acid sequence of the CNA subunit which forms the binding site for CNB Although necessary the CNB subunit per se is not sufficient to mediate an interaction with complexes amino acid residues of the CNA subunit specifically a region located within the putative catalytic domain are also required

for genes highly related to brahma brm an activator of homeotic gene expression in Drosophila We have cloned a murine gene brg1 which like brm encodes a member of the DEGH protein family suggesting that brg1 may be a ATPase or a helicase brg1 also contains a bromodomain which may be involved in transactivation Although the sequences of a number of mammalian genes similar to Drosophila brm have been reported they are related to brm only within specific portions of the putative helicase region while brg1 is highly similar to brm throughout and outside of this region A brg1 transcript was detected throughout embryogenesis and in numerous adult tissues RNA in situ hybridization revealed widespread expression of brg1 in embryonic tissues At later stages of embryogenesis differences in levels of brg1 expression were seen among different tissues brg1 expression was highest in the spinal cord the brain parts of the peripheral nervous system and the vertebral column These expression domains within the spinal cord and vertebral column encompass major regions of Hox gene expression Within the spinal cord brain and retina mRNA levels were higher in regions consisting of

extensive homology to SWI2 and Drosophila brahma We report here that a chimera with the ATPase domain replaced by corresponding human sequence restored normal mitotic growth and capacity for transcriptional activation to yeast cells Point mutation of the conserved ATP binding site lysine abolished this complementation This mutation in SWI2 exerted a dominant negative effect on transcription in yeast A lysine to arginine substitution at the corresponding residue of BRG1 also generated a transcriptional dominant negative in human cells BRG1 is exclusively nuclear and present

inhibiting the phosphatase calcineurin While multiple distinct intracellular receptors for these drugs cyclophilins and FKBPs collectively immunophilins have been characterized the functionally active ones have not been discerned We found that overexpression of cyclophilin A or B or FKBP12 increased sensitivity to CsA or FK506 respectively demonstrating that they are able to mediate the inhibitory

although calcineurin binding was clearly necessary it was not sufficient to explain the in vivo activity of the immunophilin Subcellular localization was shown also to play a role since gene deletions of cyclophilins B and C which changed their intracellular locations altered their activities significantly Cyclophilin B has been shown previously to be located within intracellular vesicles its

enhancement is known to occur through the interaction of the glucocorticoid receptor GR with specific DNA response elements In contrast negative regulation of gene expression by this class of hormone is less well understood Glucocorticoids are potent immunosuppressive agents acting primarily by inhibiting T lymphocyte activation and lymphokine production Interleukin 2 gene expression a critical early event during T lymphocyte activation is inhibited in cells by hormone treatment We have studied the mechanism of this inhibition In transgenic mice carrying linked to the enhancer expression of the transgene is inhibited by concurrent glucocorticoid treatment while a similar transgene construct driven by three copies of the binding site for nuclear factor of activated T cells is not inhibited Cotransfection experiments into jurkat cells show that the NH2 terminus of the glucocorticoid receptor is dispensable for inhibition of the enhancer but that an intact DNA binding domain although not necessarily binding to DNA is required Hybrid GRs containing the DNA binding domains of either the estrogen receptor ER or thyroid receptor as well as the entire ER all function as repressors of the enhancer We have localized the site of inhibition to two sequences located in the proximal half of the enhancer These sequences bind a similar if not identical inducible nuclear factor that has biologic characteristics that distinguish it from The mechanism of inhibition likely involves direct interactions between the GR and this factor View details for Web of Science ID

transcriptional hierarchies have been extensively studied in invertebrates their involvement in mammalian specification is poorly understood Here we report a hepatocyte transcriptional cascade suggested by the expression patterns of hepatic transcription factors in dedifferentiated hepatomas and hepatocyte fibroblast hybrids in which the liver phenotype was extinguished These results indicated that the homeoprotein hepatocyte nuclear alpha alpha and a member of the steroid hormone receptor superfamily were regulated coordinately or in a hierarchy by a locus independently of other hepatic transactivators was implicated as an essential positive regulator of alpha as deletion of an binding site in the alpha promoter abolished promoter activity and potently transactivated the alpha promoter in cotransfection assays Moreover genetic complementation of dedifferentiated hepatomas with complementary DNA rescued expression of endogenous alpha messenger RNA and activity Our studies therefore define an alpha 4 1 alpha transcriptional hierarchy operative in differentiated hepatocytes but selectively inhibited by an extinguishing locus and somatic mutations which antagonize

CHEMISTRY Flanagan Crabtree 1992 267 1 Abstract activation is a complex process mediated by cell membrane molecules including the antigen receptor TCR adhesive molecules and cytokine receptors that collectively produce an increase in intracellular and activation of protein kinase C that initiate a genetic program resulting in immunologic function and irreversible differentiation To understand how these cell membrane events are translated into a genetic regulatory cascade resulting in function we have developed an in vitro transcription system derived from Jurkat which demonstrates inducible transcription following stimulation Nuclear extracts from cells stimulated with phorbol and ionomycin which activate protein kinase C and mimic physiological activation through the antigen receptor transcribe an enhancer to template more efficient than nuclear extracts from resting and severalfold more efficient than extracts from Jurkat cells treated with phorbol or ionomycin alone Further results demonstrate that in vitro transcription of the enhancer is specific since nuclear extracts from rat liver and stimulated HeLa cells are unable to induce transcription The in vitro transcription system described here should facilitate the dissection of signals that emanate from the surface resulting in transcription and activation View details for Web of Science ID

Dimerization among transcription factors has become a recurrent theme in the regulation of eukaryotic gene expression Hepatocyte nuclear alpha alpha is a protein that functions as a dimer A dimerization cofactor of alpha DCoH was identified that displayed a restricted tissue distribution and did not bind to DNA but rather selectively stabilized alpha dimers The formation of a stable tetrameric alpha complex which required the dimerization domain of alpha did not change the DNA binding characteristics of alpha but enhanced its transcriptional activity However DCoH did not confer transcriptional activation to the GAL4 DNA binding domain These results indicate that DCoH regulates formation of transcriptionally active tetrameric complexes and may contribute to the developmental

transmission of signals from the antigen receptor to cytokine genes that coordinate the immune response The putative intracellular receptors for FK506 and cyclosporin are prolyl isomerases Binding of the drug inhibits isomerase activity but studies with other prolyl isomerase inhibitors and analysis of mutants in yeast suggest that the effects of the drug result from the formation of an inhibitory complex between the drug and isomerase and not from inhibition of isomerase activity A transcription factor which is essential for early gene activation seems to be a specific target of cyclosporin A and FK506 action because transcription directed by this protein is blocked in T cells treated with these drugs with little or no effect on other transcription factors such as and B Here we demonstrate that is formed when a signal from the antigen receptor induces a cytoplasmic subunit to translocate to the nucleus and combine with a newly synthesized nuclear subunit of FK506 and cyclosporin A block

have different transcriptional activation properties During retinoic acid RA induced differentiation of F9 embryonal carcinoma EC cells which stimulates aspects of embryogenesis both beta mRNA and immunoreactive activity are strongly induced approximately 24 h post In contrast alpha mRNA increases approximately after 5 days concomitant with elevation of alpha activity and expression of the

factor that contains a divergent homeo domain and plays a prominent role in regulating genes that have the common characteristic of being expressed in hepatocytes and a complex group of endodermally and mesodermally derived tissues alpha is unique among the vertebrate homeo proteins in that it dimerizes in the absence of its DNA recognition sequence suggesting the possibility that the function of alpha may be diversified by forming heterodimers with other related proteins We report the initial characterization of beta which is closely related to alpha and is able to form heterodimers with alpha in vitro Although alpha but not beta is expressed in the liver alpha and beta are coexpressed in the murine Hepa1A cell line and in the mammalian kidney where a subset of hepatocyte genes are expressed In contrast exclusive expression of beta is associated with repression of a subset of genes in the dedifferentiated hepatocyte cell line C2 differentiated F9 cells in somatic hybrids between hepatocytes and fibroblasts and in the lung The extent of heterodimerization may be regulated in a way because freely exchangeable heterodimers are formed in Jurkat T cells transfected with alpha and beta whereas in liver cells stable homodimers are present These studies define a pair of homeo domain proteins that have the potential to interact to produce an embryologically complex pattern of gene

produced by T lymphocytes Despite their similar effects the drugs bind to two different cytosolic protein cyclophilin and FKBP respectively which raises the possibility that they have different modes of action Using constructs in which mRNA production controlled by a specific transcription factor could be readily measured we found that both cyclosporin A and FK506 completely inhibited transcription activated by NFIL2 A NFIL2 B and partially inhibited transcription activated by NF kappa Cyclosporin A and FK506 inhibited only transcriptional activation that was dependent on mobilization However cyclosporin A and FK506 did not inhibit mobilization dependent expression of mRNA indicating that only a subset of signalling pathways regulated by is sensitive to these drugs Furthermore we did not observe any qualitative differences between the effect of cyclosporin A and FK506 on six different transcription factors which suggests that these drugs may interfere with the activity of a novel dependent step that regulates several transcription factors View details for Web of Science ID A1990EN92100026 View details for PubMedID 1702384 FUNCTIONAL EXPRESSION AND

transcription factor in individual viable cells we have applied an assay that uses the cell sorter to quantitate We have analyzed the distribution of transcriptional activity among T cells undergoing activation by using a construct in which three tandem copies of the site directs transcription of the lacZ gene Unexpectedly stimulation of cloned stably transfected Jurkat T cells leads to a bimodal pattern of expression in which some cells express no and others express high levels This expression pattern can not be accounted for by position or heritable variation Further results in which activity is correlated with activity indicate that the concentration of must exceed a critical threshold before transcription initiates This threshold likely reflects the assembly of transcription complexes at the promoter Similar constructs controlled by B or the entire enhancer show bimodal expression patterns during induction suggesting that thresholds set by the concentration of

morphologic change proliferation and the acquisition of immunologic function In most T lymphocytes two signals are required to initiate this process one supplied by the antigen receptor and the other by accessory cells or agents that activate protein kinase Recently DNA sequences have been identified that act as response elements for one or the other of the two signals but do not respond to both signals The fact that these sequences lie within the control regions of the same genes suggests that signals originating from separate cell membrane receptors are integrated at the level of the

the functional regions of the promoter and the proteins which bind to them Using a series of 5 and internal deletion mutations we found that sequences between 88 and 43 base pairs bp upstream of the transcription initiation site functioned in cis to direct properly initiated mRNA accumulation in transfected hepatocytes The efficient function of these sequences was highly distance dependent since transcriptional activity decreased by 92 when they were moved 32 bp upstream of the TATA box We demonstrated that two known and one putative transcriptional factors interacted with this sequence The transcription factor Sp1 interacted with sequences between and as demonstrated by protection from DNase I digestion with the purified protein Directly adjacent to the Sp1 site between nucleotides and there was a sequence which bound a factor Finally sequences just 5 to the CAAT site interacted with the adenovirus major late transcriptional factor as previously demonstrated Internal deletion

antigen receptor and protein kinase C PKC stimulation Agents such as phorbol PMA that stimulate PKC augment the effects of antigen but are not sufficient for activation By analysis of deletion mutants we identified three DNA sequences extending from to to and to designated sites A D and E respectively that are required for maximal induction of expression One of these regions site E interacted with a protein present only in the nuclei of cells which have been stimulated The other two sequences interacted with a protein that is constitutively expressed in T cells When multiple tandem copies of either the E site or the A site were placed upstream of the promoter they activated expression via this promoter in response to signals initiated at the antigen receptor but not following PMA stimulation For this reason we denoted them antigen receptor response elements The uncoupling of antigen receptor and PKC requirements in these studies indicates that these signal pathways are at least in part distinct and integrated at the level of the gene View details for Web of Science ID A1988M717700038 View details for PubMedID 3260003 IDENTIFICATION AND CHARACTERIZATION OF NUCLEAR
