III trial studies how well combination chemotherapy works compared to combination chemotherapy and stem cell transplant in treating patients with germ cell tumors that have returned after a period of improvement or did not respond to treatment Drugs used in chemotherapy such as paclitaxel ifosfamide cisplatin carboplatin and etoposide work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells either by killing the cells by stopping them from dividing or by stopping them from spreading Giving chemotherapy before a stem cell transplant stops the growth of cancer cells by stopping them from dividing or killing them Giving factors such as filgrastim or pegfilgrastim and certain chemotherapy drugs helps stem cells move from the bone marrow to the blood so they can be collected and stored Chemotherapy is then given to prepare the bone marrow for the stem cell transplant The stem cells are then returned to the patient to replace the cells that were destroyed by the chemotherapy It is not yet known whether combination chemotherapy and stem cell transplant are more effective than combination chemotherapy in treating patients with refractory or relapsed germ cell tumors View full

Schmidt Bhambhvani Greenberg Prado Shafer Thong Gill Skinner Shah J B 2020 Abstract Reduction of opioids is an important goal in the care of patients undergoing radical cystectomy RC Liposomal bupivacaine LB has been shown to be a safe and effective pain reliever in the immediate postoperative period and has been reported to reduce postoperative opioid requirements Since the liposomal formulation is predicated on slow systemic absorption the amount of bupivacaine administered is notably higher than that typically used with standard bupivacaine SB formulations In addition LB is costly not universally available and studies comparing this formulation to SB are lacking We sought to determine if there is a difference in postoperative opioid requirements in patients who receive LB high dose SB at the time of May 2019 we transitioned to administration of SB injected intraoperatively at the time of RC This prospective cohort was compared to a historical cohort of patients who received injection of LB at the time of surgery Primary endpoints included postsurgical opioid use measured in morphine equivalent dose MED and Numeric Rating Scale NRS pain scores and length of stay All patients were managed using principles of enhanced recovery after surgery ERAS May 2019 through August 2019 28 patients underwent RC and met eligibility criteria to receive SB at the time of surgery They were compared to a historical cohort of 34 patients who received LB between November 2017 and July 2018 There was no difference in MED exposure either in the postanesthesia care unit SB MED LB MED or during the remainder of the hospital stay SB MED LB MED no difference in NRS pain scores on postoperative day 1 SB LB day 2 SB LB or day 3 SB LB and no difference in length of stay SB days LB days Subgroup analysis of open RC and RC showed no significant difference in MED or pain scores between LB and SB patients undergoing RC under ERAS protocol there was no significant difference

Used in the Management of Hematuria After Prostatic Urethral Lift Procedure in a Patient with Thrombocytopenia A Case Report Journal of endourology case reports Spradling Deb Brubaker Gill Conti 2020 6 3 Abstract Background The prostatic urethral lift PUL procedure is a novel therapeutic method to treat lower urinary tract symptoms LUTS caused by benign prostatic hyperplasia BPH Gross hematuria after this procedure has been reported to be mild and transient This report highlights a case of refractory hematuria after the PUL procedure in addition to its management with selective prostatic arterial embolization PAE Case Presentation A Caucasian man with a history of myelodysplastic syndrome thrombocytopenia and intermittent urinary retention secondary to BPH underwent a PUL procedure Before the procedure he received a platelet transfusion making his platelet count The day after the procedure he was admitted to a hospital for gross hematuria with clot retention He was started on continuous bladder irrigation and taken to the operating room for clot evacuation and fulguration of prostate His thrombocytopenia and anemia were managed with transfusions He was treated with desmopressin aminocaproic acid and intravesical 1 alum without improvement He returned to the operating room for clot evacuation in addition to photoselective vaporization of the prostate laser ablation of the prostatic fossa He eventually required a total of four transurethral fulgurations without improvement in hematuria Ultimately resolution of the hematuria was achieved through bilateral PAE with Embosphere Microspheres performed by interventional radiology He was discharged home 2 days after the embolization procedure without recurrence of hematuria or urinary retention at a visit Conclusion The PUL procedure has been shown to be an effective alternative to more invasive surgical options for LUTS caused by BPH Despite careful consideration in an attempt to alleviate urinary retention PUL still resulted in significant bleeding in this patient with thrombocytopenia This is the first report to highlight the use of bilateral PAE as a method for achieving control of severe

Abstract BACKGROUND There are limited studies describing the detailed nonhistologic anatomy of the prostatic urethra We studied radical prostatectomy specimens to describe the ex vivo anatomical details of its shape and We conducted an observational study examining the prostatic urethra anatomy Prostatic urethra casts molds were made using vinyl polysiloxane immediately after fresh specimens had been retrieved following prostatectomy for prostate cancer The following measurements were taken from the casts anterior length posterior length maximal diameter bladder neck to verumontanum verumontanum to apex length and prostate urethral angle PUA Prostate volume was calculated using the ellipsoid formula transverse length height prostatic urethral casts were obtained The mean prostate volume was The mean PUA was The mean transverse apex and length of the prostate were and respectively The mean distance from the verumontanum to sphincter was The ratio between the anterior and posterior length of the prostatic urethra was and did not correlate with prostatic size Figure 8 The distance from the verumontanum to the apex does not change with prostate size it is uniform with a mean length of The anterior length posterior length and maximum diameter of the prostatic urethra increase with prostate size The mean difference between the anterior and posterior length is and did not correlate with prostate size Urethral angulation decreased with prostate size but was not significant Information obtained from this study is of value designing prostatic stents and devices for

Transplant Recipient Transplant infectious disease an official journal of the Transplantation Society Tan Cheng Kao Weber Pinsky B Gill Busque Subramanian Tan 2018 e12998 Abstract We present a case of cytomegalovirus CMV native kidney nephritis and prostatitis in a CMV kidney transplant recipient who had completed six months of CMV prophylaxis four weeks prior to the diagnosis of genitourinary CMV disease The patient had a history of benign prostatic hypertrophy and urinary retention that required to relieve high residual volumes At 7 months he was found to have a urinary tract infection moderate hydronephrosis of the transplanted kidney and severe hydroureteronephrosis of the native left kidney and ureter and underwent native left nephrectomy and transurethral resection of the prostate Histopathologic examination of kidney and prostate tissue revealed CMV inclusions consistent with invasive CMV disease This case highlights that CMV may extend beyond the kidney allograft to involve other parts of the genitourinary tract including the native kidneys and prostate Furthermore we highlight the risk factors that preceded CMV tissue invasion In addition to concurrent diagnoses health care providers should have a low threshold for considering CMV disease in solid organ transplant recipients presenting with signs and symptoms of genitourinary tract pathology This article is

CANCER Altobelli Buscarini Gill Skinner 2017 3 1 Abstract Background Radical cystectomy RC is associated with high risk of early and late perioperative complications and readmissions The Enhanced Recovery After Surgery ERAS protocol has been applied to RC showing decreased hospital stay without increased morbidity Objective To evaluate the specific causes of hospital readmissions in RC patients treated before and after adoption of an ERAS protocol at our institution Methods We retrospectively evaluated the outcome of 207 RC patients on ERAS protocol at the Stanford University Hospital from January 2012 to December 2014 We focused on early and late postoperative readmission rate and causes Results were compared with a consecutive series of 177 RC patients from January 2009 to December 2011 Results In the time period a total of 56 patients were readmitted 41 within the first 30 days after surgery 20 and 15 within the following 60 days 7 Fever often associated with dehydration was the most common reason for presentation to the hospital accounting for 57 of all readmissions At 90 days infection accounted for 53 of readmissions Of all the patients readmitted during the first 90 days after surgery 32 had positive urine cultures mostly caused by Enterococcus faecalis isolated in 18 56 Readmission rates did not increase since the introduction of the ERAS protocol with an incidence of 27 in the group versus 30 in the group Conclusions Despite accurate adherence to most recent perioperative antibiotic guidelines the incidence of readmissions after RC due to infection still remains significant View details for PubMedID 28149935 View details for PubMedCentralID PMC5271433 Diagnosis and Surgical Management of Uroenteric Fistula SURGICAL CLINICS OF

difficult urethral catheter placement in tertiary care hospitals and developed a treatment algorithm for this common identified all urethral catheter consults obtained by urology residents at three tertiary care hospitals from October 2009 through October 2010 Only consults for inability to place urethral catheter by the referring team were included hematuria or clot retention were excluded Patient age date of consultation consulting service prior urologic history initial number of attempts and final outcome were consults were recorded 96 were male the median age was 65 years The most common consulting services were internal medicine 35 intraoperative consults 17 and the intensive care unit 17 In 90 of cases an initial attempt at catheter placement was attempted 62 of these were made by nurses Over half of patients had known urologic pathology In 70 of cases successful placement without other adjuncts was achieved by the urology resident Twenty percent of patients required cystoscopic manipulation nine percent required suprapubic tube was achieved without adjunct procedures in the majority of consults These results support an algorithm in which all patients without a prior history of lower urinary tract pathology should undergo an initial placement attempt by the primary service physician They also underscore the need for educational efforts to improve comfort

model applicators designed for ablation of human benign prostatic hyperplasia BPH in vivo under magnetic resonance imaging MRI guidance including magnetic resonance thermal imaging MRTI determine the ability of MRI techniques to visualize ablative changes in prostate and evaluate the acute and longer term histologic appearances of prostate tissue ablated during these transurethral device incorporating a tubular transducer array with dual sectors was used to ablate canine prostate tissue in vivo in zones similar to regions of human BPH enlarged transition zones Magnetic resonance thermal imaging was used for monitoring of ablation in a environment and postablation MRIs were performed to determine the visibility of ablated regions Three canine prostates were ablated in acute studies and 2 animals were rescanned before killing at 31 days postablation Acute and chronic appearances of ablated prostate tissue were evaluated histologically and were correlated with the MRTI and postablation MRI was possible to ablate regions similar in size to enlarged transition zone in human BPH in 6 to 18 minutes Regions of acute ablation showed a central region surrounded by a region of more obvious necrosis with complete disruption of tissue architecture After 31 days ablated regions demonstrated complete apparent resorption of ablated tissue with formation of cystic regions containing fluid The inherent cooling of the urethra using the technique resulted in complete urethral preservation in all ablation of zones of size and shape corresponding to human BPH is possible using appropriate transurethral applicators using MRTI and ablated tissue may be depicted clearly in magnetic resonance images The ability accurately to monitor prostate tissue heating the apparent resorption of ablated regions over 1 month and the inherent urethral preservation suggest that the magnetic techniques described are highly promising for the in vivo ablation of symptomatic human BPH

and are increasingly being used preoperatively to achieve review our case series of surgical procedures to add to the current perioperative efficacy and complication October 2006 and February 2010 14 cytoreductive nephrectomies radical nephrectomies and metastectomies were performed after neoadjuvant sunitinib or sorafenib for advanced RCC During the same time frame a control group of 73 consecutive patients underwent radical nephrectomy cytoreductive nephrectomy or metastectomy in the absence of prior systemic therapy We compared the incidence of perioperative complications and outcomes after surgical procedures between the two preoperative renal mass size was 11 cm cm Primary tumor shrinkage was seen in 57 median shrinkage was 18 8 The median treatment period was 17 weeks and the median time from TKI discontinuation was 2 weeks Compared with a control group and after adjusting for confounding covariates presurgical TKI use was not associated with a significant increase in perioperative complications 50 40 P or perioperative bleeding 36 34 P but was associated with increased incidence and grade of intraoperative adhesions 86 58 P grade 3 1 P with the published reports we observed less hemorrhagic and wound healing issues but a significant increase in incidence and severity of intraoperative adhesions which can present a formidable technical challenge Potential reasons for our lower complication rate could be increased time from TKI discontinuation to surgery longer time to postoperative TKI increased use of preoperative angioembolization and the lack of preoperative bevacizumab administration Presurgical TKI therapy can permit effective surgical cytoreduction with a safety and complication profile equivalent to that of however safety data continue to evolve and preoperative TKI use requires further prospective investigation View details for DOI View details for PubMedID 21353796 Focal ablation of prostate cancer four roles for magnetic resonance imaging guidance CANADIAN JOURNAL OF UROLOGY Sommer Bouley Gill Daniel Pauly Diederich 2013 20 2 Abstract There is currently a great deal of interest in the possible use of focal therapies for prostate cancer since such treatments offer the prospect for control or cure of the primary disease with minimal side effects Many forms of thermal therapy have been proposed for focal ablation of prostate cancer including laser high intensity ultrasound and cryotherapy This review will demonstrate the important roles that magnetic resonance imaging MRI guidance can offer to such focal ablation focusing on the use of high intensity ultrasonic applicators as an example of one promising and interstitial high intensity ultrasonic applicators designed specifically for ablation of prostate tissue were tested extensively in vivo in a canine model The roles of MRI in positioning the devices monitoring prostate ablation and depicting ablated tissue were assessed using appropriate MRI guidance provides a very effective tool for the positioning of ablative devices in the prostate and thermal monitoring successfully predicted ablation of prostate tissue when a threshold of 52 ºC was achieved Contrast enhanced MRI accurately depicted the distribution of ablated prostate tissue which is resorbed at 30 of thermal therapies for focal ablation of prostate cancer will likely prove critically dependent on MRI functioning in four separate roles Our studies indicate that in three roles device positioning thermal monitoring of prostate ablation and depiction of ablated prostate tissue MR techniques are highly accurate and likely to be of great benefit in focal prostate cancer ablation A fourth critical role identification of cancer within the gland for targeting of thermal therapy is more problematic at present but will likely become practical with further technological advances View details for PubMedID 23587506 Prostate specific antigen the past present and future Current

oncogenic pathways in 80 Gli1 45 Stat3 10 and 5 Despite this molecular heterogeneity we identified a unique bladder gene signature by gene chip analysis This gene signature which effectively distinguishes bladder cancer with worse clinical prognosis from superficial cancer has significant clinical value It also can predict the progression of a subset of recurring cancers Finally we found that CD47 a protein that provides an inhibitory signal for macrophage phagocytosis is highly expressed in bladder compared with the rest of the tumor Blockade of CD47 by a mAb resulted in macrophage engulfment of bladder cancer cells in vitro In summary we have identified a subpopulation with potential prognostic and therapeutic value for invasive bladder cancer View details for DOI View details

SCIENCE 2009 Abstract To evaluate the feasibility of magnetic resonance MR percutaneous cryoablation of normal canine prostates and to identify MR imaging features that accurately predict the area of tissue damage at a microscopic adult male dogs were anesthetized intubated and placed in a open MR imaging system A endorectal coil was placed and prostate location and depth were determined on fast FSE MR imaging After placement of cryoprobes and temperature sensors three freezing protocols were used to ablate prostate tissue Ice ball formation was monitored with FSE imaging Tissue necrosis area was assessed with weighted MR imaging and compared with histopathologic total of 12 cryolesions mean size cm were bilaterally created in six prostates Ice ball formation was oval and on FSE sequences in all cases Postprocedural MR imaging typically showed a nonenhancing area of low signal intensity centrally located within the frozen area surrounded by a bright enhancing rim in all cases On histopathologic examination two distinct zones were identified within cryolesions Centrally a necrotic zone with complete cellular destruction and hemorrhage was found Between this necrotic zone and normal glandular tissue a zone of fragmented and intact glands interstitial edema and rare acute inflammatory cells was seen Correlation between nonenhancement on weighted MR images and tissue necrosis on pathologic examination was consistent within all six cryoablation of the prostate is technically feasible The nonenhancing area on postablation weighted MR imaging accurately predicts the

when biopsies contain very small amounts of prostate cancer Prostate biopsy findings are known to undergrade prostate cancer compared with the pathologic specimens yet remain the only grade guiding disease presence of a clinically significant grade change from biopsy cores to matched prostatectomy specimens was examined in 371 patients The biopsies were characterized for primary and secondary Gleason grade number of positive cores and total linear length of cancer The pathologic specimens were characterized for cancer volume and relative percentage by grade The rates of upgrading or downgrading were tested against all clinical and biopsy information for any significant predictive overall rate of upgrading was and downgrading was Upgrading was constant and independent of any clinical or biopsy tumor volume indexes Specifically when cancer was present in only one biopsy core and measured 2 mm or less n 48 it was just as predictive of the pathologic grade as that from any greater number of positive cores and any greater extent of cancer length present Downgrading was less frequent for biopsies with small amounts of grading from small amounts of cancer in prostate

prostate thermal therapy MEDICAL PHYSICS Ross A Diederich Nau Rieke Butts Sommer Gill Bouley 2005 32 6 Abstract Thermal therapy offers a minimally invasive option for treating benign prostatic hyperplasia BPH and localized prostate cancer In this study we investigated a transurethral ultrasound applicator design utilizing curvilinear or slightly focused transducers to heat prostatic tissue rapidly and controllably The applicator was constructed with two independently powered transducer segments operating at MHz and measuring mm x 10 mm with a 15 mm radius of curvature across the short axis The curvilinear applicator was characterized by acoustic efficiency measurements acoustic beam plots biothermal simulations of human prostate ex vivo heating trials in bovine liver and in vivo heating trials in canine prostate Each transducer segment was found to emit a narrow acoustic beam max width 3 mm which extended the length of the transducer with deeper penetration than previously developed planar or sectored tubular transurethral ultrasound applicators Acoustic and biothermal simulations of human prostate demonstrated three treatment schemes for the curvilinear applicator single shot 10 W 60 s schemes to generate narrow ablation zones 13 x 4 mm 52 degrees C at the lesion boundary incremental rotation 10 W 10 s to generate larger ablation zones 16 mm x 180 degrees sector and rotation with variable sonication times 10 W 10 s to conform the ablation zone to a predefined boundary mm x 180 degrees sector 13 min total treatment time During in vivo canine prostate experiments guided by MR temperature imaging single shot sonications 6 min with the curvilinear applicator ablated 20 degree sections of tissue to the prostate boundary mm Multiple adjacent sonications sweeping ablated large sections of the prostate 180 degrees by using the MR temperature imaging to adjust the power and sonication time s at each 10 degrees rotation such that the periphery of the prostate reached 52 degrees C before the next rotation The conclusion of this study was that the curvilinear applicator produces a narrow and penetrating ultrasound beam that when combined with image guidance can provide a precise technique for ablating target regions with a contoured outer boundary such as the prostate capsule by rotating in small steps while dynamically adjusting the net applied electrical power and sonication time at each position View details for DOI View details for Web of Science ID 000229908600015 View details for PubMedID 16013714 interstitial

diameter cylindrical piezoceramic transducers 7 to 8 MHz sectored to provide 180 degrees of angular directional heating Two in vivo experiments were performed in canine prostate The first using two interstitial ultrasound applicators the second using three ultrasound applicators in conjunction with rectal and urethral cooling In both experiments the applicators were inserted transperineally into the prostate with the energy directed ventrally away from the rectum Electrical power levels of W per element approximately W acoustic output power were applied for heating periods of 18 and 48 min MR imaging was used to monitor the thermal treatment in on a T interventional MRI system images and serial tissue sections were obtained to assess thermal damage and correlate to thermal contour plots and calculated thermal doses Results from these studies indicated a large volume of ablated nonstained tissue within the prostate extending to cm from the applicators to the periphery of the gland with the dorsal margin of coagulation by the applicator placement and directionality The shape of the lesions correlated well to the hypointense regions visible in the images and were also in good agreement with the contours of the 52 degrees C threshold temperature and t43 240 min This study demonstrates the feasibility of using directional interstitial ultrasound in conjunction with MRI

Accurate pathological characterization is important in the clinical management of these tumors We describe gene expression profiles in 41 renal tumors determined by using DNA microarrays containing unique cDNAs representing different UniGene Clusters including 7230 characterized human genes Differences in the patterns of gene expression among the different tumor types were readily apparent hierarchical cluster analysis of the tumor samples segregated histologically distinct tumor types solely based on their gene expression patterns Conventional renal cell carcinomas with clear cells showed a highly distinctive pattern of gene expression Papillary carcinomas formed a tightly clustered group as did tumors arising from the distal nephron and the normal kidney samples Surprisingly conventional renal cell carcinomas with granular cytoplasm were heterogeneous and did not resemble any of the conventional carcinomas with clear cytoplasm in their pattern of gene expression Characterization of renal cell carcinomas based on gene expression patterns provides a revised classification of these tumors and has the potential to supply significant biological and clinical

prostatectomy done with the Urolase right angle firing neodymium YAG laser fiber and standard transurethral electroresection of the prostate Efficacy of treatment as assessed by standardized American Urological Association symptom scores patient assessment of symptom improvement peak urinary flow rates residual urine volumes and complex urodynamic evaluation including assessment of opening pressure and maximum detrusor voiding pressure was equivalent for the 2 treatment groups through 1 year Ultrasonic assessment of prostatic volumes at 1 year showed a mean decrease in total volume of 59 for standard electrocautery resection compared to 28 for laser prostatectomy Symptom scores and peak urinary flow rates remained equivalent for both groups through 18 months View details for Web of

1994 15 2 Abstract The immediate and long of neodymium YAG laser treatment with the ProLase II laser fiber in the canine prostate were evaluated Fourteen male dogs aged 3 years and older with established benign prostatic hyperplasia underwent endoscopic ablation of the prostate using the ProLase II fiber Subjects were treated at laser power settings of 60 watts 6 dogs 75 watts 4 dogs or 90 watts 3 dogs with a mean total energy delivery of joules One dog underwent a sham procedure and served as a normal control Prostates were examined grossly and histologically at 48 hours 2 weeks 4 weeks or 8 weeks The diameter and volume of tissue ablation were measured in each prostate Histological studies of the extent of thermal injury to the prostatic tissue and the course of healing of the prostatic urethra were performed The mean diameter of tissue ablation was mm and mean volume of tissue ablation was cc No statistically significant difference in diameter or volume of tissue ablation was noted between varying power settings Histological studies showed extensive tissue necrosis with hemorrhage and an acute inflammatory cell infiltrate at 48 hours By 8 weeks total resolution of both necrosis and inflammatory changes with complete of the prostatic urethra was observed View details for Web of Science ID A1994PN39100004 View details for PubMedID 7528315 DOSIMETRY STUDIES UTILIZING THE UROLASE FIRING LASER FIBER LASERS IN SURGERY AND MEDICINE Kabalin Gill 1994 14 2 Abstract Neodymium YAG laser application was performed with the Urolase right angle laser fiber in a potato model and then in vivo in 29 canine prostates in an attempt to define dosimetry and optimal treatment parameters required to maximize tissue ablation and treatment efficacy Depth and volume of prostatic tissue ablation for single continuous laser applications with the Urolase fiber were measured at variable power settings from 20 to 60 watts while holding total energy delivery constant Peak tissue ablation was observed at 40 watts up to a maximum of 21 mm tissue penetration in the canine model with a mode of 15 mm The mean depth of tissue destruction at 40 watts power setting was mm with a mean volume of tissue ablation of cc The mean depth of tissue penetration at 40 watts was more than 30 greater than that observed at 60 watts and the mean volume of tissue ablation was more than 60 greater than that observed at 60 watts Holding the power setting constant at 40 watts the extent of tissue ablation was measured for variable treatment times from 60 to 120 seconds As treatment time was increased from 60 to 90 seconds tissue ablation increased significantly However beyond 90 seconds of continuous laser application at 40 watts a plateau in tissue effects was observed with no real increase in tissue ablation between 90 and 120 seconds Interruption or discontinuous laser application produced tissue effects which were significantly less than those observed for a single continuous 90 second laser treatment View details for Web of Science ID A1994NB50600006 View details for PubMedID 7514255 UROLASE LASER PROSTATECTOMY IN PATIENTS ON WARFARIN ANTICOAGULATION A SAFE TREATMENT

ILEAL NEOBLADDER JOURNAL OF UROLOGY Iwakiri Gill Anderson Freiha 1993 149 5 Abstract We examined the urodynamic characteristics and symptoms of 28 patients who had undergone the Stanford pouch bladder substitution following cystoprostatectomy Urodynamics were obtained a mean of 18 months range 6 to 43 after construction of the neobladder Mean cystometric capacity was 699 cc range 366 to All patients voided by the Valsalva maneuver and achieved good peak flow rates mean 19 cc per second Of the patients 23 emptied to near completion with a mean residual of 34 cc while 5 had residuals of greater than 150 cc mean 630 cc The neobladders demonstrated good compliance for the storage of urine with a mean basal pressure of less than 15 cm water at volumes of less than 500 cc at which most bladders function and of cm water range 1 to 72 at 100 capacity Phasic neobladder contractions were present during filling cystometrography While the number increased at higher neobladder volumes the mean length and mean pressure did not The mean pressure of contractions was less than 40 cm water at lower and higher volumes Daytime continence was attained in 26 of 28 patients 93 while 17 61 attained nighttime continence Of these 17 patients 14 82 had to void at least once at night to stay dry Daytime incontinent patients had decreased neobladder compliance at high volumes compared to daytime continent patients p but there was no difference in the maximal urethral closure pressure or the pressure of phasic contractions between these 2 groups No difference was found in any urodynamic parameter between nighttime continent and incontinent patients Patients with poor emptying ability defined as a residual of more than 150 cc had increased neobladder compliance relative to patients with good emptying ability as well as a statistically significant increased capacity cc versus 623 cc There was no difference in any important urodynamic parameter between patients who had and had not received postoperative chemotherapy We conclude that a neobladder constructed from detubularized ileum achieves adequate capacity at low pressures with a satisfactory continence rate Most patients empty the bladder to completion by Valsalva maneuver Low compliance at high volumes appears to be a factor in daytime incontinence View details for Web of Science ID A1993LA46400032 View

ON A LITHOTRIPTOR JOURNAL OF UROLOGY Kabalin Lennon Gill Wolfe Perkash I 1993 149 5 Abstract Spinal cord injury patients are at increased risk for urolithiasis and many will require treatment most commonly with extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy New second generation lithotripsy devices allow treatment without tub immersion and without general or regional anesthesia for most patients Spinal cord injury patients with loss of sensation below the level of injury would seem to be ideal candidates for such treatment We present our experience with 20 consecutive spinal cord injury patients treated without anesthesia on the Medstone STS second generation lithotriptor All patients were awake and experienced no direct sensation from the shock waves All but 1 patient T12 level however experienced autonomic dysreflexia with significant elevations in systolic blood pressure mean increase 44 mm Hg maximum 74 and diastolic blood pressure mean increase 24 mm Hg maximum 61 with reflex bradycardia mean decrease beats per minute Autonomic dysreflexia was successfully treated in this setting with sublingual nifedipine Associated bradycardia was treated with atropine in 6 patients Preoperative bowel preparation proved to be useful in spinal cord injury patients to maximize stone imaging and may decrease autonomic dysreflexia if this is caused by shock waves impacting on the distended bowel Other problems included uncontrolled skeletal muscle spasms elicited by shock waves which proved to be troublesome in maintaining patient position and stone localization Muscle spasms were decreased with benzodiazepines Care was also observed in spinal cord injury patients to pad all pressure points on the hard dry treatment surfaces associated with second generation lithotriptors

Abstract Although the use of ileocystoplasty has increased significantly in recent years very little is known concerning the smooth muscle properties of the implanted bowel segment In a previous study preliminary evidence was presented which indicated that the pharmacological response of the cytoplastic ileal segment to autonomic agonists changed toward that of the bladder The present study extends and expands these preliminary observations on the physiology and pharmacology of augmentation cystoplasty Augmentation cystoplasty with detubularized ileum was carried out in 16 rabbits In vivo and in vitro physiological and pharmacological studies were carried out one and three months after surgery The results can be summarized as follows 1 CMG at one month was similar to that of the preoperative bladder but at three months there was a 24 increase in capacity with the presence of multiple phasic contractions beginning at a volume of approximately 65 of capacity 2 The frequency and magnitude of spontaneous activity in the cystoplastic ileum did not significantly alter from that of the normal ileum 3 Cystoplastic ileum responded to muscarinic stimulation differently from the normal ileum The bladder responded with an increase in the tension whereas the ileum responded with an increase in the frequency and amplitude of phasic contractions The cystoplastic ileum responded with a pronounced sustained contraction with phasic contractions superimposed The tonic contraction at three months was of a significantly greater magnitude than that at one month 4 The qualitative and quantitative response to field stimulation of the cystoplastic ileum was altered from that of the ileum towards that of the bladder 5 The normal bladder contains greater amount of creatine phosphate and lesser amounts of creatine than the normal ileum Cystoplasty after three months induced a change in the ileal segment towards the bladder increased creatine phosphate and decreased creatine 6 The normal ileum was found to have greater number of muscarinic receptors than the normal bladder whereas the cystoplastic ileum at three months was intermediate View details for Web of Science ID

Urethral strips provide a sensitive method for quantitative pharmacology however it is not clear if the physiological response of the whole urethra to pharmacological agents can be extrapolated from these data The intent of this study was to investigate whether the linear contraction of strips is consistent with the ability of the intact urethra to alter resistance to flow To measure the effect of drugs on the ability of the intact urethra to alter resistance to flow in the absence of endogenous influences we developed an in vitro whole rabbit urethra model We characterized the effect of norepinephrine in the absence and presence of antagonists prazosin yohimbine and LY253352 on intraurethral pressure which was measured during constant saline infusion using a Statham pressure transducer We compared this to the contractile function of urethral strips The pA2 values for antagonists LY253352 prazosin and yohimbine were and respectively as determined in the whole urethra The pA2 values for these antagonists determined in urethral strips were as follows LY253352 prazosin and yohimbine Pharmacologically the whole urethra model and isolated strips appeared to respond similarly to agonists and antagonists and thus both models would be suitable for pharmacological studies on the normal urethra View details for Web of Science ID A1989AX51800008 View details for PubMedID 2587624 ADENOCARCINOMA OF THE BRITISH JOURNAL OF UROLOGY Gill Dhillon Woodhouse 1989 64 2 Abstract We report 40 patients seen over a period with a histological diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of the bladder 18 patients had primary adenocarcinoma of the bladder arising either from the urachus or from glandular metaplasia of the urothelium and the other 22 had secondary lesions representing invasion from adjacent structures notably prostate colon and ovary In this latter group symptoms related to the primary lesion were variable The distinction between primary and secondary neoplasm is an important one and was rarely made on the basis of endoscopic or clinical findings alone Urachal tumours were more common in females whereas primary and secondary vesical adenocarcinomas were more common in males The urachal tumours also occurred in a younger age group Most of the adenocarcinomas urachal or primary were already advanced at the time of diagnosis All tumours were palpable bimanually after resection and were at least T2 or T3 In the urachal carcinomas the results of partial cystectomy were disappointing because of the high rate of local recurrence and death from metastases Primary vesical adenocarcinoma carried an even poorer prognosis if surgery was carried out The mean survival was 13 months Radiotherapy was not effective in urachal and primary adenocarcinomas as these tumours are generally radioresistant The treatment of secondary adenocarcinoma was governed by the primary site of the tumour Radical surgery combined with chemotherapy and radiotherapy appeared to give the longest survival in the colonic tumours Patients with prostatic cancer had a poorer survival rate than those with the same stage tumour but without bladder involvement with renal failure secondary to obstructive uropathy being the commonest cause of death View details for Web of Science ID A1989AL37700007 View details for PubMedID 2765779 OF 2 COMPUTERIZED SEMEN MOTILITY ANALYZERS ANDROLOGIA Gill VanArsdalen Hypolite LEVIN Ruzich 1988 20 5 Abstract Semen analysis is one of the primary tests carried out to investigate the infertile male Subjective evaluation of semen is often prone to observer bias and error To eliminate this a number of computerized semen analyzers have recently been introduced into the market and we have evaluated two of the more popular models the Cell Soft Semen Analyzer and the Hamilton Thorn Motility Analyzer HTM 2000 The Cell Soft identifies sperm on the basis of user defined values for cell size and luminosity whereas the Hamilton Thorn identifies sperm by motility and then applies the average size and luminosity of all moving objects to non moving sperm cells Semen samples from 25 normal donors and 25 subfertile patients were analyzed using these two models of computerized semen analyzers and also by an experienced technician using both the Makler chamber and the hemocytometer The results obtained from the two automated analyzers were compared with those obtained by subjective evaluation Variation in sperm count and motility were analyzed according to the sperm density Four groups less than 30 with debris less than 30 and greater than 50 were studied The majority of patients fit into the first two groups We observed that the HTM 2000 is superior to the Cell Soft in evaluating sperm count within the patient population group For our donor population with an average sperm count of greater than 85 both systems provide extremely accurate counts ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS View

LEVIN Hanno WITKOWSKI B Gill Steinhardt 1988 140 1 Abstract A substantial body of animal work indicates that the initial first line defense against invading microorganisms in the urinary tract is the antiadherence activity of the surface mucin layer Previous work has demonstrated that bacterial adherence to anion exchange resin can be used as a model for adherence to the mucin deficient rabbit bladder This anion exchange resin adherence model can also be used as a rapid screen for potential antiadherence agents In vitro saline extracts of bladder mucosa from various mammalian species including man have been shown to inhibit bacterial adherence to both anion exchange resin and the mucin deficient rabbit bladder The present report investigates the ability of in vivo saline bladder washes from several groups of patients to inhibit bacterial adherence to anion exchange resin This has an advantage over other methods of quantitation or visualization of mucin since it is the ability of the bladder extract to prevent bacterial adherence and not merely the quantity of mucin that determines the effectiveness of the mucin lining in preventing bacterial attachment Bladder washes from patients with recurrent urinary tract infection were significantly less potent at inhibiting bacterial adherence than extracts from other groups of patients This decreased functional antiadherence activity of bladder extracts may help explain the frequency of urinary tract infection in this group of patients View details for Web of Science ID A1988P085400049 View details for PubMedID 3379683 THE EFFECTS OF INVIVO ISCHEMIA ON THE CONTRACTILE FUNCTION OF THE RABBIT JOURNAL OF UROLOGY Gill Monson WEIN Ruggieri LEVIN 1988 139 6 Abstract The proper functioning of any smooth muscle requires adequate perfusion with oxygen and nutrients Ischemia compromises both these factors and results in dysfunction the extent depending on the degree and duration of ischemia This study determined the effects of one two and four weeks in vivo ischemia on the capacity compliance and contractile function of the rabbit urinary bladder Morphological changes were also studied with light microscopy Different degrees of ischemia were achieved as follows In the unilateral group the vesical artery was tied on one side and the animals were sacrificed at one week or two weeks In the bilateral group the vesical arteries on both sides were tied and the animals were sacrificed one week later In the bilateral staged group the vesical artery was tied on one side and after one week the contralateral artery was ligated and the animals sacrificed one week after the second procedure Muscle strips were studied for contractile response with a distinction being made between the ipsilateral and contralateral side of vessel ligation in the unilateral group The results were as follows 1 In the unilateral group there was a 72 reduction in the contractile response of the dome of the bladder to bethanecol on the side of vessel ligation and a 32 reduction on the contralateral side The response to methoxamine on the base was reduced by 44 with no difference between the ipsilateral and contralateral side 2 Bilateral vessel ligation resulted in a 97 reduction in contractile response to bethanechol on the dome and a 75 in the response of the base to methoxamine 3 Staged bilateral ligation resulted in a 69 reduction in the contractile response of the dome to bethanechol and a 18 reduction in the response of the base to methoxamine Ischemia caused a marked reduction in the compliance and capacity of the bladder in all the three groups with the most marked changes in the bilateral group Multiple spontaneous contractions were noted in the three groups during the filling phase of the cystometrograms Histological features correlated well with the functional changes in the different groups View details for Web of Science ID A1988N638900059 View details for PubMedID

glucose as one of its primary sources of metabolic energy We have studied the effect of bethanechol on both glycolysis and high energy phosphate metabolism The results can be summarized as follows bethanechol administration in vitro stimulates a 30 decrease in intracellular glycogen a 100 increase in lactic acid production and an 80 increase in CO2 generation Although there was a rapid and sustained decrease in the intracellular concentration of creatine phosphate there was only a minor decrease in the intracellular concentration of ATP There were no changes in adenine uptake or de novo

practitioners without urolithiasis Urinary urate was slightly higher in the stone formers than in the normals but this was not statistically significant Furthermore when results were corrected for the higher creatinine excretions of the stone formers then the reverse was true and statistically significant All subjects with urinary urate over h were separately studied In these groups the normals had higher urate and creatinine excretions than the stone formers but when results were corrected for creatinine the difference in the urate excretions disappeared In long term follow up studies urinary calcium was lowered by diet and more so by diet supplemented with either Bendrofluazide or cellulose phosphate Each drug raised urinary oxalate slightly and this was statistically significant while both drugs together caused an even bigger rise in oxalate excretion An unexpected finding was a rise in urinary urate with cellulose phosphate View details for Web of Science ID A1985AWM6800002 View
