amyloidosis based on a large amyloidosis causes significant morbidity and mortality often leading to restrictive cardiomyopathy progressive heart failure and death Historically heart transplantation outcomes have been worse in patients with cardiac amyloidosis compared with other heart failure populations in part due to the systemic nature of the disease However several case series have suggested that transplantation outcomes may be better in the contemporary era likely in part due to the availability of more effective light chain suppressive therapies for light chain study examined all patients seen between 2004 and 2017 either at the Stanford University Medical Center or the Kaiser Permanente Santa Clara Medical Center who were diagnosed with cardiac amyloidosis and ultimately underwent heart transplantation This study examined characteristics and outcomes in this group compared with the overall transplantation population at our the study period 31 patients 13 with light chain amyloidosis and 18 with transthyretin ATTR amyloidosis underwent heart transplantation Patients with ATTR amyloidosis were older were more likely to be male had worse baseline renal function and had longer waitlist times compared with both patients with light chain amyloidosis and the overall transplantation population there were no differences in bleeding renal failure infection rejection or malignancy There was no significant difference in mortality between patients who underwent heart transplantation for amyloid cardiomyopathy and patients who underwent heart transplantation for all

Abstract The availability of novel agents NAs including blinatumomab and inotuzumab ozogamicin InO has improved the outcomes of patients with RR acute lymphoblastic leukemia ALL Because of the relative effectiveness it is often a challenge for clinicians to determine how to best sequence these NAs with respect to efficacy and this multicenter retrospective study of patients with RR ALL treated with blinatumomab InO or both their efficacy as a first or second NA was 276 patients 221 and 55 received blinatumomab and InO respectively as a first NA therapy The complete remission CR remission with incomplete count recovery CRi rate was 65 and 67 for the blinatumomab and InO groups respectively P The rate of treatment discontinuation due to adverse events was 4 and 7 in the blinatumomab and InO groups respectively patients 43 in the blinatumomab group and 13 patients 29 in the InO group proceeded with allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation The median overall survival OS was 15 and months in the blinatumomab and InO groups respectively A subset analysis was performed for 61 patients who received both NAs blinatumomab and then InO n 40 or InO and then blinatumomab n 21 The rate was 58 for patients who received InO as the second NA and 52 for patients who received blinatumomab as the second NA The median OS was for patients who received InO as the

Liedtke Zheng Chang Majeti Greenleaf J 2019 Abstract Identifying the causes of human diseases requires deconvolution of abnormal molecular phenotypes spanning DNA accessibility gene expression and protein We present a framework that integrates highly multiplexed protein quantification transcriptome profiling and analysis of chromatin accessibility Using this approach we establish a normal epigenetic baseline for healthy blood development which we then use to deconvolve aberrant molecular features within blood from patients with acute Despite widespread epigenetic heterogeneity within the patient cohort we observe common malignant signatures across patients as well as regulatory features that are shared across phenotypic compartments of individual patients Integrative analysis of transcriptomic and maps identified putative linkages and transcription factors that regulate genes such as regulatory elements proximal to the marker gene CD69 These results demonstrate how integrative multiomic analysis of single cells within the framework of normal development can reveal both distinct and shared molecular mechanisms of disease from patient samples View details for DOI

is associated with extensive toxicity and disappointingly low efficacy in relapsed patients ALL blast cells express several surface antigens including CD20 CD22 and CD19 which represent valuable targets for immunotherapy Monoclonal antibodies conjugates and bispecific antibodies targeting these antigens offer novel mechanisms of action Within the last several years the antibody rituximab has been added to chemotherapy for newly diagnosed patients 60 years with ALL and significantly improved the survival from 52 to 65 In adults with relapsed or refractory ALL the conjugate inotuzumab ozogamicin resulted in a complete response rate of 81 and median overall survival of months with reduced toxicity compared with standard chemotherapy Similarly the bispecific antibody blinatumomab yielded a complete response rate of 44 and a median overall survival of months in an extensively treated ALL population Moreover 80 of ALL patients in complete remission with evidence of minimal residual disease MRD achieved a complete MRD response following treatment with blinatumomab These results highlight the tremendous promise of treatment approaches for ALL Ongoing and future research is critical to further define the role of the various immunotherapies in the frontline treatment of ALL Additional challenges include the optimal sequencing of the available antibodies in the relapsed

myeloma is characterized by the clonal expansion of malignant plasma cells in the bone marrow But the phenotypic diversity and the contribution of less predominant clones to the biology of this disease have been controversial Here we asked whether cells bearing the dominant multiple myeloma immunoglobulin rearrangement occupy phenotypic compartments other than that of plasma cells To accomplish this we combined FACS index sorting and Neighbor Embedding visualization with immunoglobulin sequencing to track selected clones across different stages of human development As expected the predominant clones preferentially mapped to aberrant plasma cell compartments albeit phenotypically altered from wild type Interestingly up to of cells of the predominant clones colocalized with cells of a normal phenotype In addition minor clones with distinct immunoglobulin sequences were detected in up to 9 of sequenced cells but only 2 out of 12 of these clones showed aberrant immune phenotypes The majority of these minor clones showed intraclonal silent nucleotide differences within the CDR3s and varying frequencies of somatic mutations in the immunoglobulin genes Therefore the phenotypic range of multiple myeloma cells in the bone marrow is not confined to plasma cells but extends to low frequencies of B cells in line with the recently reported success of B cellular therapies in some patients The majority of minor clones result from parallel nonmalignant expansion Cancer Immunol Res 5 9 AACR View details for PubMedID 28768640 View details for PubMedCentralID PMC5590392 Novel

immunoglobulin light chain amyloidosis AL fail to achieve a complete response CR to standard light chain suppressive chemotherapy and almost all patients eventually experience hematologic relapse and progression of organ involvement Additional treatment options are needed We present our retrospective experience of 25 consecutive previously treated AL patients who received daratumumab a monoclonal antibody approved for the treatment of multiple myeloma Daratumumab was administered at 16 weekly for 8 weeks then every 2 weeks for 8 doses and then every 4 weeks Patients had received a median of 3 prior lines of therapy with a previous hematologic CR in only 5 patients The overall hematologic response rate to daratumumab was 76 including CR in 36 and very good partial response in 24 Median time to response was 1 month Therapy was well tolerated even among the 72 of patients with cardiac AL involvement Grade infusion reactions occurred in 15 patients but no grade 3 or 4 reactions were observed Daratumumab is a highly effective agent that produced rapid and deep hematologic responses without unexpected toxicity in our cohort of heavily pretreated AL patients View details for

With Amyloidosis from the Stanford University Amyloidosis Registry The American journal of cardiology Tuzovic Kobayashi Wheeler Barrett Liedtke Lafayette Schrier Haddad Witteles 2017 120 8 Abstract Cardiac involvement is common in patients with AL amyloidosis and portends a poor prognosis although little is known about the changes in cardiac mechanics after chemotherapy We sought to explore the relation between amyloidosis staging and baseline cardiac mechanics and to investigate changes in cardiac mechanics after chemotherapy We identified 41 consecutive patients from the Stanford Amyloid Center who had echocardiograms and free values before and after chemotherapy along with 40 and controls Echocardiographic assessment included left ventricular global longitudinal strain ratio and left atrial LA stiffness Hematologic response to chemotherapy was defined as reduction in the difference between the involved and the uninvolved free light chain dFLC The mean age was years and 66 were men Before chemotherapy global longitudinal strain ratio and LA stiffness were impaired in patients with amyloidosis compared with controls and the severity of impairment worsened with advanced staging After chemotherapy hematologic response was observed in 30 73 patients There was a significant association between the change in dFLC and cardiac function ratio r p LA stiffness r p There was no significant improvement in cardiac mechanics in patients without a hematologic response to chemotherapy In conclusion amyloidosis stage correlated with noninvasive measurements of cardiac mechanics

UPR has been implicated in multiple types of human cancers including multiple myeloma MM Through an in silico drug discovery approach based on virtual docking we identified the anthracycline antibiotic doxorubicin as an in vitro and in vivo inhibitor of XBP1 activation a previously unknown activity for this widely utilized cancer chemotherapeutic drug Through a series of mechanistic and phenotypic studies we showed that this novel activity of doxorubicin was not due to inhibition of topoisomerase II Topo II Consistent with its inhibitory activity on the branch of the UPR doxorubicin displayed more potent cytotoxicity against MM cell lines than other cancer cell lines that have lower basal activity In addition doxorubicin significantly inhibited XBP1 activation in CD138 tumor cells isolated from MM patients Our findings suggest that the activity of doxorubicin may be utilized clinically to target tumors such as MM View details for DOI View details for PubMedID 27634301

Marks a Human Leukemia Stem Cell Population and Is Required for Development of Acute Myeloid Leukemia Cell stem cell Iwasaki Liedtke Gentles Cleary 2015 17 4 Abstract Leukemia stem cells LSCs are thought to share several properties with hematopoietic stem cells HSCs including quiescence and a capacity for These features are hypothesized to underlie leukemic initiation progression and relapse and they also complicate efforts to eradicate leukemia through therapeutic targeting of LSCs without adverse effects on HSCs Here we show that acute myeloid leukemias AMLs with genomic rearrangements of the MLL gene contain a LSC population Although human CD34 CD38 LSCs are generally highly quiescent the lectin CD93 is expressed on a subset of actively cycling AML cells enriched for LSC activity CD93 expression is functionally required for engraftment of primary human AML LSCs and leukemogenesis and it regulates LSC predominantly by silencing CDKN2B a major tumor suppressor in AML Thus CD93

fluorescence or electrochemiluminescence immunoassays of soluble cytokines are commonly performed in the context of human serum or plasma to look for disease biomarkers and to monitor the immune system in a simple and minimally invasive way These assays provide challenges due to the complexities of the matrix serum or plasma and the presence of many cytokines near the limit of detection of the assay Here we compare the readout of matched serum and plasma samples which are generally correlated However a subset of cytokines usually have higher levels in serum and the background is significantly increased in serum versus plasma Presumably as a result of this background decreases in cytokines can sometimes be detected in plasma but not in serum We further show through spike recovery experiments that both serum and plasma inhibit the readout of many cytokines with some variability between donors but with serum causing greater inhibition than plasma in many cases Standard diluents from different vendors can partially reverse this inhibition to varying degrees Dilution of samples can also partly overcome the inhibitory effect of the matrix We also show that dilution is nonlinear and differentially affects various cytokines Together these data argue that 1 plasma is a more sensitive matrix for detecting changes in certain cytokines 2 calculation of concentrations in serum or plasma matrices is inherently inaccurate and 3 dilution of samples should not be assumed to be linear all comparisons need to be made among similarly diluted samples View details for DOI View

Alhamadsheh 2013 110 24 Abstract The misassembly of soluble proteins into toxic aggregates including amyloid fibrils underlies a large number of human degenerative diseases Cardiac amyloidoses which are most commonly caused by aggregation of Ig light chains or transthyretin TTR in the cardiac interstitium and conducting system represent an important and often underdiagnosed cause of heart failure Two types of amyloid cardiomyopathies are clinically important The Val122Ile V122I mutation which alters the kinetic stability of TTR and affects 3 to 4 of African American subjects can lead to development of familial amyloid cardiomyopathy In addition aggregation of WT TTR in individuals older than age 65 y causes senile systemic amyloidosis amyloid cardiomyopathies are chronic and progressive conditions that lead to arrhythmias biventricular heart failure and death As no Food and Drug drugs are currently available for treatment of these diseases the development of therapeutic agents that prevent cardiotoxicity is desired Here we report the development of AG10 a potent and selective kinetic stabilizer of TTR AG10 prevents dissociation of in serum samples obtained from patients with familial amyloid cardiomyopathy In contrast to other TTR stabilizers currently in clinical trials AG10 stabilizes and equally well and also exceeds their efficacy to stabilize WT and mutant TTR in whole serum Crystallographic studies of AG10 bound to give valuable insights into how AG10 achieves such effective kinetic stabilization of TTR which will also aid in designing better TTR stabilizers The oral bioavailability of AG10 combined with additional desirable features makes it a very promising candidate to treat TTR amyloid cardiomyopathy View details for DOI View details

weeks Patients received continued therapy until disease progression unacceptable toxicity or completion of 12 cycles patients median age 74 years were enrolled with equal distribution according to European LeukemiaNet risk The overall response rate was 40 rate of complete remission with or without complete recovery of blood counts 28 The median time to complete remission with or without complete recovery of blood counts was 12 weeks and duration of this status was 28 weeks range 4 104 weeks acute myeloid leukemia and a high score on the Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation Comorbidity Index were negative predictors of response Early death was noted in 17 of patients Grades 3 toxicities were uncommon and most adverse events were gastrointestinal fatigue and myelosuppression In conclusion a sequential combination of azacitidine plus lenalidomide has clinical activity in older patients with acute myeloid leukemia and further studies of this combination are underway View

diagnosed adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia ALL Patients with ALC at day 28 had a median overall survival OS of months when compared with months for those with an ALC 350 HR P Among patients who achieved a complete remission median survival EFS for those with ALC on day 28 was months when compared with months in those with ALC 350 HR P In multivariable analysis the ALC on day 28 350 P for OS and EFS along with WBC at diagnosis or P for OS and EFS and cytogenetics abnormal normal P for OS and P for EFS were independent prognostic factors of both OS and EFS Combining these three factors segregates patients in three risk groups These data suggest that ALC can be used in combination with other prognostic features to better predict outcome and that targeting the immune system to improve

extramedullary disease bone marrow failure advanced stage disease and expression of distinct immunophenotypic markers such as lack of CD56 and presence of CD20 Historically the treatment of PCL has primarily been palliative with only a small minority of patients achieving a durable remission The impact of newer agents such as bortezomib and lenalidomide in conjunction with autologous and

PubMedID 21083471 mediated by the Ras association 1 domain of AF6 activates the oncogenic potential of BLOOD Liedtke Ayton Somervaille Smith Cleary 2010 116 1 Abstract MLL is a common target for chromosomal translocations associated with acute leukemia resulting in its fusion with a large variety of nuclear or cytoplasmic proteins that may activate its oncogenic properties by distinct but poorly understood mechanisms The fusion gene represents the most common leukemogenic fusion of mixed lineage leukemia MLL to a cytoplasmic partner protein Here we identified a highly conserved Ras association RA1 domain at the of AF6 as the minimal region sufficient for mediated myeloid progenitor immortalization in vitro and short latency leukemogenesis in vivo Moreover the ability of RA1 to activate MLL oncogenesis is conserved with its Drosophila ortholog Canoe Although the AF6 RA1 domain has previously been defined as an interaction surface for guanosine Ras single amino acid substitutions known to abolish the interaction did not abrogate oncogenesis Furthermore fusion of MLL to heterologous RA domains of or RalGDS or direct fusion of MLL to constitutively active or RAP1 was not sufficient for oncogenic activation of MLL Rather the AF6 RA1 domain efficiently mediated suggesting that constitutive MLL is a more common pathogenic mechanism for MLL oncogenesis than indicated by previous studies of rare MLL fusion partners View details for DOI View details for Web of Science ID 000279641400012 View details for PubMedID 20395419 View details for PubMedCentralID

underlying molecular abnormalities of disease The mixed lineage leukemia MLL is a recurrent site of genetic rearrangements in acute leukemias and since its discovery in 1992 many advances have been made in understanding its role in leukemogenesis A variety of MLL translocation partners have been described and detailed studies have identified functional domains that are required for transformation Proteins associated with the MLL core complex or its fusion partners have been isolated and characterized for their critical roles in leukemia pathogenesis Downstream mediators of MLL transcriptional regulation and multiple collaborating signaling pathways have been described and characterized These advances in our understanding of leukemogenesis provide a foundation for ongoing

examination or per cent of relapses were detected by routine imaging while 80 were identified by reported symptoms or abnormalities on exam Patients were times 95 CI more likely to have low risk disease if relapse was diagnosed by routine imaging group 1 compared with those diagnosed by reported symptoms or physical findings group 2 Median overall survival for group 1 versus group 2 was 54

IDENTIFY INVOLVED IN THE CATALYTIC FUNCTION OF THE RESTRICTION ENDONUCLEASE ECORV BIOCHEMISTRY SELENT RUTER Kohler Liedtke THIELKING Alves Oelgeschlager Wolfes Peters Pingoud A 1992 31 20 Abstract We have used mutagenesis of the EcoRV restriction endonuclease to change amino acid side chains that have been shown crystallographically to be in close proximity to the scissile phosphodiester bond of the DNA substrate DNA cleavage assays of the resulting mutant proteins indicate that the largest effects on nucleolytic activity result from substitution of Asp74 Asp90 and Lys92 We suggest on the basis of structural information mutagenesis data and analogies with other nucleases that Asp74 and Asp90 might be involved in binding catalysis and that Lys92 probably stabilizes the pentacovalent phosphorus in the transition state These amino acids are part of a sequence motif which is also present in EcoRI In both enzymes it is located in a structurally similar context near the scissile phosphodiester bond A preliminary mutational analysis with EcoRI indicates that this sequence motif is of similar functional importance for EcoRI and EcoRV On the basis of these results a proposal is made for the mechanism of DNA cleavage by EcoRV and EcoRI View details for Web of Science ID A1992HW13800010 View details for PubMedID 1591242 Report Accessibility Issues Powered By CAP Network
