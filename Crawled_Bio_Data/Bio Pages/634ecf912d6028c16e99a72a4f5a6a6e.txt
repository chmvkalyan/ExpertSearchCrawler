Research and Scholarly Interests My background and expertise is in the field of computational biology with concentration in health services research A key focus of my research is to apply novel methods and tools to large clinical datasets for hypothesis generation comparative effectiveness research and the evaluation of quality healthcare delivery My research involves managing and manipulating big data which range from administrative claims data to electronic health records and applying novel biostatistical techniques to innovatively assess clinical and policy related research questions at the population level This research enables us to create formal statistically rigid evaluations of healthcare data using unique combinations of large datasets Projects Improving Quality of Postoperative Pain Care Through use of Electronic Health Records Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality AHRQ September 1 2015 Millions of Americans undergo surgery every year and postoperative pain is common and often poorly managed Poorly managed postoperative pain may cause severe functional impairment impaired care of the underlying diseases transition to chronic pain and decreased quality of life Many controlled studies have demonstrated a variety of interventions that benefit postoperative pain yet their application in a large and more diverse population is unknown and a nationally endorsed concise quality process metric for postoperative pain management does not exist One roadblock is that postoperative pain and its related outcomes are complex The gathering of evidence from electronic health data which draw from and inform practice could bypass this roadblock and inform decisions that lead to effective and efficient postoperative pain management This project seeks to measure quality of care for postoperative pain assess proposed interventions from randomized controlled trails lay the ground work for systematic research using EMRs and produce evidence for a postoperative pain management quality metric To achieve these objectives this project has three specific aims 1 to develop standardized electronic definitions of care processes and outcomes prolonged opioid use readmission for pain etc 2 to extract clinically meaningful data from both structured data and free text in electronic medical records EMR and examine the relationship between recommended care processes and outcomes for postoperative pain using EMRs 3 to validate relationships at a national level and to develop a National Quality Forum submission and evaluation form for a postoperative pain quality metric s This project will achieve these aims by developing data capture algorithms on Palo Alto Veterans Administration VA Healthcare data refining algorithms at a tertiary academic hospital and validating algorithms on the National VA healthcare system Data will be identified and extracted from the EMR using an extended version of our validated workflow Established experience with quality metric development and NQF endorsement will facilitate the dissemination of this work These approaches are the basis of a learning healthcare system and the proposed research directly aligns with AHRQ s mission and goals to improve healthcare quality through health information technology and data resources Location Stanford University Collaborators

Prostate Cancer Care National Cancer Institute NCI Prostate cancer is the most common malignancy in men Newly diagnosed men face complex treatment choices each with different risks of acquired morbidities including outcomes PCOs The widespread implementation of electronic health records EHRs provides opportunities to incorporate PCOs into healthcare quality metric evaluations However efforts to assess quality metrics in EHRs have been limited because most relevant data are not reliably captured in structured formats Our proposal innovates in three ways First we will develop an EHR prostate cancer database that will allow for clinical care data to be analyzed alongside diagnostic details Second we will create novel ontological representations of quality metrics that will be public and reliably calculable across Third we will assemble a robust workflow that expands on existing quality assessment methods by focusing on dictionaries to annotate free text Combining this set of innovative components will uniquely allow us to use existing EHRs to efficiently study the association between treatment processes and outcomes Our methods are applicable not only to prostate cancer but any disease with associated quality metrics Our primary hypothesis is important prostate cancer PCOs will differ significantly across treatments robotic surgery open prostatectomy and radiation therapy To gather data to test our hypothesis we assemble a workflow to extract quality metrics from both structured and components of EHRs In Aim 1 we will create the building blocks needed to identify quality metric data in the EHR We will develop an map quality metrics to medical vocabularies and ontologies and create quality metric phenotypes This will be the first endeavor to generate structured representations of quality metrics In Aim 2 we will expand our workflow to gather data relevant to quality metrics from EHRs This will allow us to identify and validate a comprehensive set of quality metrics from the EHR We will validate our technologies in 3 different EHR systems to ensure transportability In Aim 3 we will develop a risk assessment tool to compare PCOs across prostate cancer treatments Our proposal will be the largest assessment of quality metrics It will produce a validated list of structured quality metrics workflow clinician documentation feedback reports and risk assessment tool Given the current state of prostate cancer treatment and research these results will significantly impact clinical care providing clinicians and patients with evidence needed to balance the risks and benefits of different treatment options Our work is consistent with our nation s focus on EHR meaningful use and the comprehensive and systematic assessment of healthcare delivery and with NCI s focus on improving the quality of cancer care delivery Location Stanford University Collaborators James Brooks Professor Stanford University Douglas Blayney Stanford

Intelligence AI is a solution to guide clinical decision making for this novel disease resulting in the rapid dissemination of and potentially biased models which may exacerbate the disparities gap We believe there is an urgent need to enforce the systematic use of reporting standards and develop regulatory frameworks for a shared data source to address the challenges of bias in AI during this pandemic There is hope that AI can help guide treatment decisions within this crisis yet given the pervasiveness of biases a failure to proactively develop comprehensive mitigation strategies during

Association between emails and overall survival in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy Evidence from the setting Cancer medicine Coquet Blayney Brooks 2020 Abstract Prior studies suggest email communication between patients and providers may improve patient engagement and health outcomes The purpose of this study was to determine whether emails are associated with overall survival benefits among cancer patients undergoing identified emails through the patient portal in electronic health records EHR among 9900 cancer patients receiving chemotherapy between 2013 and 2018 Email users were defined as patients who sent at least one email 12 months before to 2 months after chemotherapy started A propensity cohort analysis was carried out to reduce bias due to confounding age primary cancer type gender insurance payor ethnicity race stage income Charlson score county of residence The cohort included 3223 email users and 3223 users The primary outcome was overall survival stratified by email use Secondary outcomes included number of visits prescriptions and telephone calls The healthcare teams response to emails and other forms of communication was also investigated Finally a quality measure related to inpatient and emergency department visits was survival was higher in patients who were email users with an adjusted hazard ratio of 95 CI p Email users had higher rates of healthcare utilization including visits 63 50 p drug prescriptions 28 21 p and phone calls 18 16 p Clinical quality outcome measure of inpatient use was better among email users p emails are associated with a survival benefit among cancer patients receiving chemotherapy and may be a proxy for patient engagement As payment models emphasize incorporating the patients voice into their care

address a variety of issues faced in clinical practice has increased rapidly However questions have arisen regarding biases in their development that can affect their applicability in specific populations We sought to evaluate whether studies developing ML models from electronic health record EHR data report sufficient demographic data on the study populations to demonstrate representativeness and searched PubMed for articles applying ML models to improve clinical using EHR data We limited our search to papers published between 2015 and the 164 studies reviewed demographic variables were inconsistently reported included as model inputs was not reported in 64 gender and age were not reported in 24 and 21 of studies respectively Socioeconomic status of the population was not reported in 92 of studies Studies that mentioned these variables often did not report if they were included as model inputs Few models 12 were validated using external populations Few studies 17 their code Populations in the ML studies include higher proportions of White and Black yet fewer Hispanic subjects compared to the general US demographic characteristics of study populations are poorly reported in the ML literature based on EHR data Demographic representativeness in training data and model transparency is necessary to ensure that ML models are deployed in an

Phenotyping severity of outcomes using clinical notes A prostate cancer use case Learning health systems Bozkurt Paul Coquet Sun Banerjee Brooks 2020 4 4 e10237 Abstract A learning health system LHS must improve care in ways that are meaningful to patients integrating outcomes PCOs into core infrastructure PCOs are common following cancer treatment such as urinary incontinence UI following prostatectomy However PCOs are not systematically recorded because they can only be described by the patient are subjective and captured as unstructured text in the electronic health record EHR Therefore PCOs pose significant challenges for phenotyping patients Here we present a natural language processing NLP approach for phenotyping patients with UI to classify their disease into severity subtypes which can increase opportunities to provide therapy and promote a delivery undergoing prostate cancer treatment from 2008 to 2018 were identified at an academic medical center Using a hybrid NLP pipeline that combines and deep learning methodologies we classified positive UI cases as mild moderate and severe by mining clinical model accurately classified UI into disease severity categories accuracy which outperformed the deep learning model accuracy In the deep learning model the recall rates for mild and moderate group were higher than the precision rate and respectively A hybrid model that combined both methods did not improve the accuracy of the model but did outperform the deep learning model accuracy patients based on indication and severity of PCOs is essential to advance a patient centered LHS EHRs contain valuable information on PCOs and by using NLP methods it is feasible to accurately and efficiently phenotype PCO severity Phenotyping must extend beyond the identification of disease to provide classification of disease severity that can be used to guide treatment and inform shared Our methods demonstrate a path to a patient centered LHS that could

An Approach Ophthalmology Glaucoma Wang Azad Lin Pershing 2020 Abstract PURPOSE To evaluate changes in intraocular pressure IOP after cataract surgery among patients with or without glaucoma using automated extraction of data from electronic health records EHRs Retrospective cohort Adults who underwent standalone cataract surgery at a single academic center from Patient information was identified from procedure and billing codes demographic tables medication orders clinical notes and eye examination fields in the EHR A previously validated natural language processing pipeline was used to identify laterality of cataract surgery from operative notes and laterality of eye medications from medication orders Cox proportional hazards modeling evaluated factors associated with the main outcome of sustained postoperative IOP OUTCOME MEASURES Sustained surgery IOP reduction measured at 14 months or the last while using equal or fewer glaucoma medications compared with baseline and without additional glaucoma laser or surgery on the operative The median for 7574 eyes of 4883 patients who underwent cataract surgery was 244 days The mean preoperative IOP for all patients was mmHg standard deviation SD mmHg which decreased to mmHg SD mmHg at 12 months after surgery Patients with IOP of mmHg or more showed mean postoperative IOP reduction ranging from to mmHg Cataract surgery was more likely to yield sustained IOP reduction for patients with primary glaucoma hazard ratio HR 95 confidence interval or narrow angles or angle closure HR 95 confidence interval compared with patients without glaucoma Those with a higher baseline IOP were more likely to achieve postoperative IOP reduction HR per increase in baseline IOP 95 confidence interval Our results suggest that patients with primary glaucoma or with narrow angles or chronic angle closure were more likely to achieve sustained IOP reduction after cataract surgery Patients with higher baseline IOP had increasingly higher odds of achieving reduction in IOP This evidence demonstrates the potential usefulness of a pipeline for automated extraction of ophthalmic surgical outcomes from EHR to answer key

preoperative risk assessment tools are often cumbersome have limited accuracy and are poorly adopted The Care Assessment Need CAN score an existing tool developed for primary care providers in the Veterans Administration system VA is automatically calculated for individual patients using electronic health record data Therefore it could present an efficient preoperative risk assessment tool The aim of this project was to determine if the CAN score can be repurposed as a preoperative risk assessment tool for patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty TKA multicenter retrospective observational study was conducted using national VA data from 2013 to 2016 The cohort included veterans who underwent TKA identified through International Classification of Diseases Ninth Revision and CPT Current Procedural Terminology codes The focus of the study was the preoperative patient CAN score a single numerical value ranging from 0 to 99 with a higher score representing greater risk that is automatically calculated each week using multiple data points in the VA electronic health record Study outcomes of interest were readmission prolonged hospital stay 5 days mortality and patient study included veterans Their median preoperative CAN score was 75 although there was substantial variability in patient CAN scores among different facilities A preoperative CAN score of 75 was significantly associated with mortality odds ratio OR prolonged length of stay OR readmission OR and discharge OR The CAN score had good accuracy with a receiver operating characteristic ROC curve value of for all outcomes except CAN score can be leveraged as an extremely efficient way to patients before TKA with results that surpass other commonly available and alternatives As a result this

fully leverage the data with fast implementation A robust linear regression was fitted to describe the association between the pain score and time from discharge after total knee replacement The estimated trajectories were used for a subsequent cluster analysis to categorize the longitudinal pain score patterns into distinct clusters For each cluster a mixture regression model estimated the association between pain score and time to discharge adjusting for confounding The fitted regression model generated the pain trajectory pattern for given cluster Finally regression analyses examined the association between pain trajectories and patient outcomes A total of 3442 surgeries were identified with a median of 22 pain scores at an academic hospital during Four pain trajectory patterns were identified and one was associated with higher rates of outcomes In conclusion we described a novel approach with fast implementation to model patients pain experience using electronic health records In the era of big data science clinical research should be learning from all available data regarding a patient episode of care instead of focusing on the average patient outcomes View details

internationally Limited work has been done to characterize the profile of PUs in the ICU using observational data from the electronic health record EHR Consequently there are limited prognostic tools for determining a patient risk of PU development with most institutions relying on risk scores such as the Braden score to identify and Results Using EHR data from admissions in a tertiary ICU we show that the prevalence of PUs at stage 2 or above is percent For the admissions where a PU was recorded on day 2 or beyond we evaluated the prognostic value of the Braden score measured within the first 24 hours A Braden score had precision and recall for the future development of a PU We trained a range of machine learning algorithms using demographic parameters diagnosis codes laboratory values and vitals available from the EHR within the first 24 hours A weighted linear regression model showed precision and recall for future PU development Classifier performance was not improved by integrating Braden score elements into the We demonstrate that an model can outperform the Braden score as a screening tool for PUs This may be a useful tool for automatic risk stratification early in an

role in the delivery of healthcare However evidence indicates that such algorithms have the potential to worsen disparities currently intrinsic to the contemporary healthcare system including racial biases Blame for these deficiencies has often been placed on the the underlying training data bears greater responsibility for these errors as biased outputs are inexorably produced by biased inputs The utility equity and generalizability of predictive models depend on training data with robust feature sets So while the conventional paradigm of big data is deductive in decision future model harnesses the potential of big data for inductive reasoning This may be conceptualized as clinical decision questioning intended to liberate the human predictive process from preconceived lenses in data solicitation interpretation Efficacy representativeness and generalizability are all heightened in this schema Thus the possible risks of biased big data arising from the inputs themselves must be acknowledged and addressed Awareness of data deficiencies structures for data inclusiveness strategies for data sanitation and mechanisms for data correction can help realize the potential of big data for a personalized medicine era Applied deliberately these considerations could help mitigate risks of perpetuation of health inequity amidst widespread adoption of novel applications of big data

epidemic Total knee arthroplasty TKA is a common and painful procedure accounting for a large number of opioid prescriptions Adjuvant analgesics nonopioid drugs with primary indications other than pain have shown beneficial pain management and effects following TKA in clinical trials We evaluated the adjuvant analgesic gabapentin for its usage patterns and its effects on opioid use pain and This retrospective observational study included patients who received primary TKA between 2009 and 2017 using electronic health records from an academic tertiary care medical institute Descriptive statistics and multivariate modeling were used to estimate associations between inpatient gabapentin use and adverse pain outcomes as well as inpatient oral morphine equivalents per day OME Overall there was an annual increase in gabapentin use P Modeled estimates suggest that gabapentin is associated with a significant decrease in opioid consumption estimate 95 confidence interval P when controlling for patient characteristics Patients receiving gabapentin had similar discharge pain scores pain scores and unplanned readmission rates compared with patients receiving no adjuvant

machine learning approach PloS one Parthipan Banerjee Humphreys Asch Curtin Carroll 2019 14 2 e0210575 Abstract prodrug opioids hydrocodone require conversion by liver enzyme to exert their analgesic effects The most commonly prescribed antidepressant selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors SSRIs inhibits activity and therefore may reduce the effectiveness of prodrug opioids We used a machine learning approach to identify patients prescribed a combination of SSRIs and prodrug opioids postoperatively and to examine the effect of this combination on postoperative pain control Using EHR data from an academic medical center we identified patients receiving surgery over a period We developed and validated natural language processing NLP algorithms to extract information diagnosis SSRI use symptoms from structured and unstructured data elements The primary outcome was the difference between preoperative pain score and postoperative pain at discharge and time points We developed computational models to predict the increase or decrease in the postoperative pain across the 3 time points by using the patient EHR data medications vitals demographics captured before surgery We evaluate the generalizability of the model using method where the holdout test method is repeated 10 times and mean AUC is considered as evaluation metrics for the prediction performance We identified surgical patients with symptoms of depression A total of were prescribed both an SSRI and a prodrug opioid were prescribed an SSRI and a opioid were prescribed a prodrug opioid but were not on SSRIs and were prescribed a opioid but were not on SSRIs Our NLP algorithm identified depression with a F1 score of against manual annotation of 300 randomly sampled clinical notes On average patients receiving prodrug opioids had lower average pain scores p with the exception of the group at postoperative However had significantly worse pain control at discharge 3 and p compared to patients whereas there was no difference in pain control among the patients by prodrug opioid p The machine learning algorithm accurately predicted the increase or decrease of the discharge and pain scores when compared to the pain score using cross validation mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve and respectively Preoperative pain surgery type and opioid tolerance were the strongest predictors of postoperative pain control We provide the first direct clinical evidence that the known ability of SSRIs to inhibit prodrug opioid effectiveness is associated with worse pain control among depressed patients Current prescribing patterns indicate that prescribers may not account for this interaction when choosing an opioid The study results imply that prescribers might instead choose direct acting opioids oxycodone or morphine in depressed patients on SSRIs View details for PubMedID 30726237 Merging heterogeneous clinical data to enable knowledge discovery Pacific

spondylolisthesis with stenosis can be treated by decompression with or without fusion Fusion has traditionally been preferred We hypothesized that rates of reoperation after decompression alone would be higher than after undertook a analysis of administrative discharge records from California Florida and New York inpatient ambulatory and emergency department settings between 2005 and 2011 with Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project data We identified all patients who had degenerative spondylolisthesis who were treated with decompression alone or with fusion and compared their rates of reoperation at 1 3 and 5 years from the index operation We used descriptive statistics and a hierarchical logistic regression model to generate odds of study consisted of patients with spondylolisthesis 6712 of them underwent decompression alone and of them underwent fusion Rates of reoperation were higher for decompression versus fusion at 1 year versus but at 3 years versus and 5 years versus years rates of reoperation were not statistically different Patients treated with decompression alone that had a second operation tended to have the operation sooner versus days study suggests that treatment of degenerative spondylolisthesis with fusion or decompression alone results in similar rates of reoperation at 5 years This medium term data indicate that decompression alone

Gastroschisis Closure A Prospective Randomized Controlled Trial Journal of the American College of Surgeons Bruzoni Jaramillo Dunlap Abrajano Stack Hintz Dutta 2017 224 6 e1 Abstract Sutureless gastroschisis repair involves covering the abdominal wall defect with the umbilical cord or a synthetic dressing to allow closure by secondary intention No randomized studies have described the outcomes of this technique Our objective was to prospectively compare outcomes of sutureless vs sutured closure in a randomized recruited patients who presented with gastroschisis between 2009 and 2014 and were randomized into either sutureless or sutured treatment groups Patients with complicated gastroschisis stricture perforation and ischemia were excluded Predefined ventilation feeding and dressing change protocols were instituted Primary outcomes were time to extubation and time to full feeds Secondary outcomes included time to discharge and rate of complications Data were analyzed using Fisher exact or using a p value Factors associated with increased time to discharge were estimated using multivariate patients were enrolled 19 to sutureless and 20 to sutured repair There was no statistical difference in time to extubation sutureless vs sutured days p The sutureless group had a significant increase in mean time to full feeds vs days p and mean time to discharge vs days p Complication rates were similar in both groups Multivariate regression modeling showed that an increase in time to discharge was independently associated with sutureless repair feeding complications and repair of uncomplicated gastroschisis can be performed safely however it is associated with a significant increase in time to full feeds and time to discharge View details for DOI View details for

Curtin McDonald Bhattacharya 2017 Abstract OBJECTIVE Orthopedic procedures are an important focus in efforts to reduce surgical site infections SSIs In 2008 the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid CMS stopped reimbursements for additional charges associated with serious conditions including SSI following certain orthopedic procedures We aimed to evaluate the CMS policy effect on rates of targeted orthopedic SSIs among the Medicare population DESIGN We examined SSI rates following orthopedic procedures among the Medicare population before and after policy implementation compared to a similarly aged control group Using the Nationwide Inpatient Sample database for we estimated rate ratios RRs of orthopedic SSIs among Medicare and patients using a approach RESULTS Following policy implementation SSIs significantly decreased among both the Medicare and populations RR 95 confidence interval CI and RR 95 CI respectively However the estimated decrease among the Medicare population was not significantly greater than the decrease among the control population RR 95 CI CONCLUSIONS While SSI rates decreased significantly following the implementation of the CMS nonpayment policy this trend was not associated with policy intervention but rather larger secular trends that likely contributed to decreasing SSI rates over time Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol 2017 View details for DOI

Mackey Carroll 2017 42 3 Abstract Minocycline is a microglial cell inhibitor and decreases pain behaviors in animal models Minocycline might represent an intervention for reducing postoperative pain This trial tested whether perioperative administration of minocycline reduced time to pain resolution TPR after standardized hand surgeries with known prolonged pain profiles carpal tunnel release CTR and trigger finger release TFR randomized controlled trial included patients undergoing CTR or TFR under local anesthesia Before surgery participants recorded psychological and pain measures Participants received oral minocycline 200 mg or placebo 2 hours prior to procedure and then 100 mg of minocycline or placebo 2 times a day for 5 days After surgery participants were called daily assessing their pain The primary end point of TPR was when participants had 3 consecutive days of 0 postsurgical pain Futility analysis and analyses were total of 131 participants were randomized and 56 placebo and 58 controls were analyzed Median TPR for CTR was 3 weeks with 15 having pain more than 6 weeks Median TPR for TFR was 2 weeks with 18 having pain more than 6 weeks The overall median TPR for the placebo group was 2 weeks 10 pain 6 weeks versus weeks 17 pain 6 weeks for the minocycline group Futility analysis found that the likelihood of a true underlying clinically meaningful reduction in TPR owing to minocycline was only Survival analysis found minocycline did not reduce TPR However subgroup analysis of those with elevated posttraumatic distress scores found the minocycline group had longer administration of minocycline did not reduce TPR after minor hand surgery There was evidence that minocycline might increase length of pain in those with increased

emergency department ED readmissions have few known modifiable predictors Pain experienced by patients may reflect surgical complications inadequate or difficult symptom Veterans Affairs Surgical Quality Improvement data on inpatient general vascular and orthopedic surgery from 2008 to 2014 were merged with laboratory vital sign health care utilization and postoperative complications data Six distinct postoperative inpatient pain trajectories were identified 1 persistently low 2 mild 3 moderate or 4 high trajectories and 5 or 6 trajectories based on postoperative pain scores Regression models estimated the association between pain trajectories and postdischarge utilization while controlling for important patient and clinical sample included orthopedics general and vascular Overall the unplanned readmission rate was and ED utilization rate was Patients in the high pain trajectories had the highest rates of postdischarge readmissions and ED visits and respectively P In multivariable models compared with the persistently low pain trajectory there was a increase in postdischarge ED visits and readmission for diagnoses but not postdischarge complications χ trend P pain trajectories identify populations at risk for readmissions and ED visits and do not seem to be mediated by postdischarge complications Addressing pain control expectations before discharge may help

Event Detection An Application to Physician Reporting EGEMS Washington DC Tamang Ross Gaskin Patel Shah 2017 5 1 5 Abstract The adoption of electronic health records EHR s has increased the availability of routinely collected clinical data in electronic form that can be used to improve the reporting of quality of care However the bulk of information in the EHR is in unstructured form clinical notes and not amenable to automated reporting Traditional methods are based on structured diagnostic and billing data that provide efficient but inaccurate or incomplete summaries of actual or relevant care processes and patient outcomes To assess the feasibility and benefit of implementing enhanced based physician quality measurement and reporting which includes the analysis of unstructured text clinical notes we conducted a retrospective study to compare traditional and enhanced approaches for reporting ten physician quality measures from multiple National Quality Strategy domains We found that our enhanced approach enabled the calculation of five Physician Quality and Performance System measures not measureable in billing or diagnostic codes and resulted in over a increase in event at an average precision of 88 percent 95 percent CI percent Our work suggests that enhanced quality measurement can increase event detection for establishing payment arrangements and can expedite quality reporting for physician practices which are increasingly burdened by the process of manual chart review for quality reporting View details for PubMedID 29881731 The Epidemiology

Finnegan Shaffer Remington Kwong Curtin 2017 99 12 Abstract Major joint replacement surgical procedures are common elective procedures with a care episode that includes both inpatient readmissions and postoperative emergency department ED visits Inpatient readmissions are well studied however to our knowledge little is known about ED visits following these procedures We sought to characterize ED visits following a major joint replacement surgical used administrative records from California Florida and New York from 2010 through 2012 to identify adults undergoing total knee and hip arthroplasty Factors associated with increased risk of an ED visit were estimated using hierarchical regression models controlling for patient variables with a fixed hospital effect The main outcome was an ED visit within 30 days of the patients who underwent major joint replacement returned to the inpatient setting and presented to the ED for care within 30 days Among ED visits had a primary diagnosis of pain and had both a primary a secondary diagnosis of pain Patients presenting to the ED for subsequent care had more comorbidities and were more frequently with public insurance relative to those not returning to the ED p There was a significantly increased risk p of isolated ED visits with regard to type of insurance when patients with Medicaid odds ratio OR 95 confidence interval CI to and those with Medicare OR 95 CI to were compared with patients with private insurance and with regard to race when black patients OR 95 CI to and Hispanic patients OR 95 CI to were compared with white patients These increases in risk were stronger for isolated ED visits for patients with a pain visits following an elective major joint replacement surgical procedure were numerous and most commonly for diagnoses Medicaid patients had almost double the risk of an ED or ED visit following a surgical procedure The future of insurance coverage expansions are uncertain however there are ongoing attempts to improve quality across the continuum of care It is therefore essential to ensure that all patients particularly vulnerable populations receive appropriate postoperative care

MEDICINE Morrison Goldstein B Hsia Y 2016 67 6 Abstract The 2010 provision of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act ACA extended eligibility for health insurance for young adults aged 19 to 25 years It is unclear however how expanded coverage changes health care behavior and promotes efficient use of emergency department ED services Our objective was to use emergency department data to characterize any changes in diagnoses seen in ED among young adults since the implementation of the ACA dependent coverage performed a analysis of 2009 to 2011 ED visits from California Florida and New York using administrative data to determine how the use of ED services changed for clinical categories after the ACA provision among young adults aged 19 to 25 years compared with slightly older adults unaffected by the provision aged 26 to 31 analyzed a total of ED visits made by patients After the implementation of the 2010 ACA provision young adults had a relative decrease of ED visits per people compared with the older group For the majority of diagnostic categories young adults rates and risk of visit did not change relative to that of slightly older adults after the implementation of the ACA However although young adults ED visits significantly increased for mental illnesses and diseases of the circulatory system eg nonspecific chest pain visits decreased for diagnoses and diseases of the skin eg cellulitis abscess compared with that of the older group and respectively results indicate that increased coverage has kept young adults out of the ED for specific conditions that can be cared for through access to other channels As EDs face capacity challenges these results are encouraging and offer insight into what could be expected under further insurance expansions

that provide a representation of biomedical knowledge from the Open Biological and Biomedical Ontologies OBO project and adds the ability to describe how this knowledge was derived We here describe the state of OBI and several applications that are using it such as adding semantic expressivity to existing databases building data entry forms and enabling interoperability between knowledge

roles and functions Prior to OBI it was not possible to use a single internally consistent resource that could be applied to multiple types of experiments for these applications OBI has made this possible by creating terms for entities involved in biological and medical investigations and by importing parts of other biomedical ontologies such as GO Chemical Entities of Biological Interest ChEBI and Phenotype Attribute and Trait Ontology PATO without altering their meaning OBI is being used in a wide range of projects covering genomics immunology and catalogs of services OBI has also

Safety Indicators PSIs are administratively coded identifiers of potentially preventable adverse events These indicators are used for multiple purposes including benchmarking and quality improvement efforts Baseline PSI evaluation in surgeries is fundamental to both PSI rates and their impact on other outcomes in patients undergoing cranial neurosurgery compared with other Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality AHRQ PSI software was used to flag adverse events and determine rates RAR Regression models were built to assess the association between PSIs and important patient identified cranial neurosurgeries based on International Classification of Diseases Ninth Revision Clinical Modification codes in California Florida New York Arkansas and Mississippi State Inpatient Databases AHRQ development readmission length of stay hospital costs and inpatient total of neurosurgical patients were identified Procedure indication was strongly associated with PSI development The neurosurgical population had significantly higher RAR of most PSIs evaluated compared with other surgical patients Development of a PSI was strongly associated with increased length of stay and hospital cost and in certain PSIs increased inpatient mortality and this study certain accountability measures proposed for use as payment modifiers show higher RAR in neurosurgery patients compared with other surgical patients and were subsequently associated with poor outcomes Our results indicate that for quality improvement efforts the current AHRQ models should be viewed in clinically meaningful stratified subgroups for profiling and applications additional factors should be included in the models Further evaluation of PSIs in additional surgeries is needed to better inform the use

Following Prostatectomy EGEMS Washington DC Tamang Blayney Brooks Shah 2016 4 3 Abstract National initiatives to develop quality metrics emphasize the need to include outcomes outcomes are complex require documentation of patient communications and have not been routinely collected by healthcare providers The widespread implementation of electronic medical records EHR offers opportunities to assess outcomes within the routine healthcare delivery system The objective of this study was to test the feasibility and accuracy of identifying patient centered outcomes within the from patients with localized prostate cancer undergoing prostatectomy were used to develop and test algorithms to accurately identify outcomes in EHRs we used urinary incontinence as the use case Standard data mining techniques were used to extract and annotate free text and structured data to assess urinary incontinence recorded within the total prostate cancer patients were identified in our between Among these EHRs had a text mention of urinary incontinence within 90 days compared to less than with a structured data field for urinary incontinence code Our workflow had good precision and recall for urinary incontinence positive predictive value and sensitivity data indicate that important outcomes such as urinary incontinence are being captured in EHRs as free text and highlight the importance of accurate clinician documentation Standard data mining algorithms can accurately and efficiently identify these outcomes in existing EHRs the complete assessment of these outcomes is essential to

Abstract To better understand how perioperative care affects charges for carpal tunnel release CTR developed a cohort using procedure code for CTR in the National Survey of Ambulatory Surgery 2006 to test perioperative factors potentially associated with CTR costs We examined factors that might affect costs including patient characteristics payer surgical time setting hospital outpatient department freestanding ambulatory surgery center anesthesia type anesthesia provider discharge status and adverse events Records were grouped by facility to reduce the impact of surgeon and patient heterogeneity Facilities were divided into quintiles based on average total facility charges per CTR This division allowed comparison of factors associated with the lowest and highest quintile of facilities based on average charge per total of CTRs were performed in 2006 Nearly all patients were discharged home without adverse events Mean charge across facilities was SD Patient complexity and intraoperative duration of surgery was similar across quintiles approximately 13 min Anesthesia techniques were not significantly associated with patient complexity charges and total perioperative time Hospital outpatient department setting was strongly associated with total charges with 500 higher charge per CTR Half of all CTRs were performed in hospital outpatient departments Facilities in the lowest quintile charge group were freestanding ambulatory surgery of charges for CTR suggests that surgical setting is a large cost driver with the potential opportunity to lower charges for CTRs

study were to determine readmission rates for cranial neurosurgery and identify factors associated with authors identified patient discharge records for cranial neurosurgery and their readmissions using the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality AHRQ State Inpatient Databases for California Florida and New York Patients were categorized into 4 groups representing procedure indication based on diagnosis codes Logistic regression models were developed to identify patient characteristics associated with readmissions The main outcome measure was unplanned inpatient admission within 30 days of total of patients underwent cranial neurosurgery for neoplasm seizure vascular conditions and trauma Inpatient mortality was highest for vascular admissions and lowest for neoplasm admissions p readmissions were for the neoplasm group for the seizure group for the vascular group and for the trauma group p Significant predictors of readmission for neoplasm were Medicaid payer OR 95 CI and disorder OR 95 CI for seizure male sex OR 95 CI and index admission through the emergency department OR 95 CI for vascular Medicare payer OR 95 CI and renal failure OR 95 CI and for trauma congestive heart failure OR 95 CI and coagulopathy OR 95 CI Many readmissions had primary diagnoses identified by the AHRQ as potentially frequency of readmission rates for patients undergoing cranial neurosurgery varied by diagnosis between 14 and 24 Important patient characteristics and comorbidities that were associated with an increased readmission risk were identified Some characteristics

United States studies have reported varying outcomes associated with transfer status However even as national quality improvement efforts and regulations are being actively adopted forcing hospitals to become financially accountable for the quality of care provided surprisingly little is known about transfer patients or their outcomes at a population level This study provides timely analyses of the characteristics of this particularly vulnerable and sizable inpatient population We identified and compared characteristics and outcomes of transfer and nontransfer the use of the 2009 Nationwide

that transfer patients have inferior outcomes compared with nontransfer patients Although they are clinically complex patients and assessing accountability as between the transferring and receiving hospitals is methodologically difficult transfer patients must nonetheless be included in quality benchmark data to assess the potential impact this population has on hospital outcome profiles With

emergency department ED care and other health services To test the impact of the ACA on how young adults used ED services we used state administrative records from California Florida and New York to compare changes in ED use in young adults ages before and after the ACA provision was implemented with changes in the same period for people ages the control group Following implementation of the ACA provision the younger group had a decrease of ED visits per people compared to the older relative change of percent The largest relative decreases were found in women percent and blacks percent This relative decrease in ED use implies a total reduction of more than visits from young adults ages across the three states in 2011 When we compared the probability of ever using the ED before and after implementation of the ACA provision we found a minimal decrease percent among the younger group compared to the older group This suggests that the change in the number of visits was driven by fewer visits among ED users not by changes in the number of people who ever visited the ED View details for DOI View details for PubMedID 25201671 National Review of Factors Influencing Disparities and

studied It has been suggested that correct physician identification impacts patient satisfaction in hospitalized patients however the limited studies that exist have demonstrated mixed this study we sought to identify factors associated with improved satisfaction among ED patients and specifically to test whether improving physician identification by patients would lead to increased performed a and postintervention study of patients at the end of their ED visits We compared patient satisfaction scores as well as patients abilities to correctly identify their physicians over two separate periods prior to and after introducing a multimedia presentation of the attending physicians into the waiting total of 486 patients 25 of all ED visits were enrolled in the study In the combined study population overall patient satisfaction was higher among patients who correctly identified their physicians than among those who could not identify their physicians combined mean satisfaction score of odds ratio OR Overall satisfaction was also higher among parents or guardians of pediatric patients than among adult patients satisfaction score of OR and among patients who experienced a shorter time satisfaction score of for shorter waiting time for longer waiting time OR Ambulance patients showed decreased satisfaction over some satisfaction parameters including physician courtesy and knowledge No direct relationship was demonstrated between the study intervention multimedia presentation and improved patient satisfaction or physician patient satisfaction was found to be positively correlated with correct physician identification shorter waiting times and among the pediatric patient population Further studies are needed to determine interventions that improve patients abilities to identify

years in the United States Timely care in a designated trauma center has been shown to reduce mortality by 25 However many severely injured patients are not transferred to trauma centers after initially being seen at center emergency departments EDs OBJECTIVES To determine and factors associated with the decision to admit rather than transfer severely injured patients who are initially seen at center EDs and to ascertain whether insured patients are more likely to be admitted than transferred compared with uninsured patients DESIGN SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS Retrospective analysis of the 2009 Nationwide Emergency Department Sample We included all ED encounters for major trauma Injury Severity Score 15 seen at centers in patients aged 18 to 64 years We excluded ED discharges and ED deaths We quantified the absolute risk difference between admission vs transfer by insurance status while adjusting for age sex mechanism of injury Injury Severity Score weekend admission and month of visit and urban vs rural status and median household income of the home zip code as well as annual ED visit volume and teaching status and US region MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Inpatient admission vs transfer to another acute care facility RESULTS In 2009 a total of 4513 observations from 636 center EDs were available for analysis representing a nationally weighted population of 19 312 center ED encounters for major trauma Overall in 2009 were admitted to the center Compared with patients without insurance the adjusted absolute risk of admission vs transfer was 95 CI higher for patients with Medicaid and 95 CI higher for patients with private insurance Other factors associated with admission vs transfer included severe abdominal injuries risk difference 95 CI urban teaching hospital vs hospital risk difference 95 CI and annual ED visit volume risk difference 95 CI higher for every additional 10 000 annual ED visits CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Patients with severe injuries initially evaluated at center EDs were less likely to be transferred if insured and were at risk of receiving suboptimal trauma care Efforts in monitoring and optimizing trauma interhospital transfers and

in the plastic surgery literature suggests that financial constraints are limiting access to autologous reconstruction AR This study follows national trends in breast reconstruction and identifies factors associated with reconstructive choices Data were obtained from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample from 1998 to 2008 Patients were categorized as having either implant or ARs Bivariate and multivariate regression analysis identified variables associated with receiving implants versus AR Physician fee schedules were analyzed using national average Medicare physician reimbursement rates From 1998 to 2008 breast reconstructions were performed Reconstructions increased 4 per year The proportion of implant reconstructions increased 11 per year whereasARs decreased 5 per year p Our model showed that the odds of having versus AR were significantly associated with age disease severity payer type hospital teaching status and year of surgery Year of surgery was the strongest predictor of implant reconstruction patients receiving breast reconstructive surgery in 2009 were three times more likely to have implant breast reconstructive surgery compared with similar patients in 2002 Medicare reimbursement steadily declined for AR over a similar time frame From 1998 to 2008 autologous breast reconstruction has significantly declined parallel to a decrease in physician reimbursement Our data found no significant change in patient characteristics supporting the lack of choice of AR Further research is warranted to better understand this shift to implant

whereas open surgical operations for bowel obstruction and abdominal hernias are higher after open repair However readmission rates after EVAR or open repair for nonoperative conditions and complications that do not require an intervention are not well documented We sought to determine reasons for readmissions within the first year after open repair and who underwent elective AAA repair in California during a period were identified from the Health Care and Utilization Project State Inpatient Database All patients who had a readmission in California year of their index procedure were included for evaluation Readmission rates and primary and secondary diagnoses associated with each readmission were analyzed and 2003 to 2008 there were operations for elective AAA repair comprising 9356 EVARs 60 and 6380 open repairs 40 At 1 year postoperatively the readmission rate was after open repair and after EVAR The three most common principle diagnoses associated with readmission after any type of AAA repair were failure to thrive cardiac issues and infection When stratified by repair type patients who underwent open repair were more likely to be readmitted with primary diagnoses associated with failure to thrive cardiac complications and infection compared with EVAR all P Those who underwent EVAR were more likely however to be readmitted with primary diagnoses of complications cardiac complications and readmission rates within 1 year after elective AAA repair are greater after EVAR than after open repair Reasons for readmission vary between the two cohorts but are related to the magnitude of open surgery after open repair device issues after EVAR and the usual cardiac and infectious complications after either intervention analysis of these causes of

has not been previously reported in the literature The purpose of our study was to determine the incidence of misrepresented or phantom publications in plastic surgery residency applicants and to identify possible predisposing used the Electronic Residency Application Services database to our plastic surgery residency program during a period from 2006 to 2009 Applicant demographic information and listed citations were extracted journal article citations were verified using robust methods including PubMed Institute for Scientific Information ISI Web of Knowledge and Google Unverifiable articles were categorized as phantom publications and then evaluated with respect to applicant demographic information and the study period there were 804 applications average 201 applicants per year There was a total of 4725 publications listed of which 1975 had been categorized as journal articles Two hundred 14 of publications could not be verified and were categorized as phantom publications There was an overall significant positive trend in percentage of phantom publications during the 4 application years P A positive predictive factor for having phantom publications was being a foreign medical graduate P A negative predictive factor for phantom publications was being a female applicant P There also appeared to be a positive correlation with the number of publications listed and likelihood of phantom plastic surgery residency applicants we found a significant percentage of unverifiable publications There are several possible explanations for our findings which include the fact that plastic surgery is a highly specialty and applicants may feel the need to appear competitive to residency programs Publications are an important aspect of the residency selection process and factors into applicant ranking but our study suggests publications listed in plastic surgery residency applications may not necessarily be an accurate representation of actual published articles

robotic surgery compared with open and laparoscopic surgery and to investigate the factors that affect the risk of physical symptoms and surgeons from all specialties trained in the use of robots were sent a online survey and responded and fifteen surgeons who practiced all three approaches were used in the analysis and surgeons had physical discomfort or symptoms attributable to operating Of those with symptoms attributed most of the symptoms to laparoscopic surgery to open surgery and to robotic surgery A higher case load was predictive of increased symptoms for open and laparoscopic surgery but not for robotic surgery Robotic surgery was less likely than open or laparoscopic surgery to lead to neck back hip knee ankle foot and shoulder pain and less likely than laparoscopic surgery to lead to elbow and wrist pain Robotic surgery was more likely than either open or laparoscopic surgery to lead to eye pain and more likely than open surgery to lead to finger pain Nearly a third of

symptoms This study was to evaluate risk factors predictive of microemboli in patients undergoing protected CAS with a distal embolic protection device All CAS patients who received and postprocedural magnetic resonance imaging MRI evaluations for carotid interventions at a single academic institution from July 2004 to December 2008 were examined Microemboli were defined by new hyperintensities on postoperative DWI with corresponding decreased diffusion Risk factors including patient demographics medical comorbidities clinical symptoms lesion morphologies and perioperative information were examined and logistic regression analyses were utilized to determine predictors of microemboli A total of 204 patients underwent carotid interventions 76 CAS and 128 carotid endarterectomies during the study period 167 of them including 67 CAS patients received both preoperative and postoperative MRIs Among those who underwent protected CAS the incidence of microemboli was despite a relative low incidence of associated neurological symptoms Univariate and multivariate regression analyses showed that date of procedure odds ratio OR and p and preoperative transient ischemic attack symptoms OR and p were independent predictors of developing postoperative changes on DWI in the ipsilateral hemisphere and age 76 years was predictive of having new lesions on DWI in the contralateral hemisphere

from PTSD after gastric bypass We also examined the effect of bariatric surgery on PTSD retrospective review of prospective data compares veterans with and without PTSD who underwent laparoscopic gastric bypass Differences between the means of age initial BMI and percent excess weight loss were compared between the groups using a Student t test Pearson chi 2 was used to evaluate the relationship between a diagnosis of PTSD major depressive disorder MDD and other Axis I psychiatric disorders A similar analysis was done to assess for a relationship between PTSD and comorbidities including diabetes mellitus DM hypertension HTN hyperlipidemia and identified 24 patients who had gastric bypass and a diagnosis of PTSD before surgery and compared them to those without PTSD Both groups had a similar mean age and initial BMI There was no significant difference between the percent excess weight lost after 1 year between the PTSD group 66 and the group 72 p In assessing comorbid

improve technical ability by comparing the performance of both experts and novices on a complex laparoscopic task and a robotically assisted experts LE with substantial laparoscopic and robotic experience n 9 and laparoscopic novices LN n 20 without any robotic experience performed sequentially 10 trials of a suturing task using either robotic or standard laparoscopic instrumentation fitted to the ProMIS surgical simulator Objective performance metrics provided by ProMIS total task time instrument pathlength and smoothness and an assessment of learning curves were with LNs the LEs demonstrated significantly better performance on all assessment measures Within the LE group there was no difference in smoothness 328 159 vs 355 174 P between and standard laparoscopic tasks An improvement was noted in total task time 113 41 vs 132 55 sec P and instrument pathlengths 371 163 vs 645 269 cm P when using the robot This advantage in terms of total task time however was lost among the LEs by the last 3 trials 114 40 vs 118 49 s P while instrument pathlength remained better consistently throughout all the trials For the LNs performance was significantly better in the robotic trials on all 3 measures throughout all the ProMIS surgical simulator was able to distinguish between skill levels expert versus novice on robotic suturing tasks suggesting that the ProMIS is a valid tool for measuring skill in surgery For all the ProMIS metrics novices demonstrated consistently better performance on a suturing task using robotics as compared to a standard laparoscopic setup This effect was less evident for experts who demonstrated improvements only in their economy of movement pathlength but not in the speed or smoothness of performance Robotics eliminated the early learning curve for novices which was present when they used standard laparoscopic tools Overall this study suggests that when performing complex tasks such as knot tying surgical robotics is most useful for inexperienced laparoscopists who experience an early and persistent enabling effect For experts robotics is most useful for improving economy of motion which may have implications for

overexpression of oncogenes are a cardinal feature of lung cancer and directly contribute to its pathogenesis To uncover such novel alterations we performed an comparative genomic hybridization survey of 128 lung cancer cell lines and tumors Prominent among our findings we identified recurrent amplification at cytoband in 3 of lung cancer specimens with another 11 of specimens exhibiting gain spanning that locus The amplicon core contained eight named genes only four of which were overexpressed by transcript profiling when amplified Among these CRKL encodes an adapter protein functioning in signal transduction best known as a substrate of the kinase in chronic myelogenous leukemia knockdown of CRKL in lung cancer cell lines with but not without amplification led to significantly decreased cell proliferation progression cell survival and cell motility and invasion In addition overexpression of CRKL in immortalized human bronchial epithelial cells led to enhanced growth cell growth Our findings indicate that amplification and resultant overexpression of CRKL contribute to diverse oncogenic phenotypes in lung cancer with implications for targeted therapy and highlight a

understand how well and which cell lines best model that diversity In particular microarray studies have identified molecular A luminal B and characteristic patterns and underlying DNA copy number alterations CNAs Here we studied a collection of breast cancer cell lines to catalog molecular profiles and to assess their relation to breast cancer DNA microarrays were used to profile gene expression and CNAs in a collection of 52 breast cancer cell lines and comparisons were made to existing profiles of primary breast tumors Hierarchical clustering was used to identify subtypes and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis GSEA to discover biological features of those subtypes Genomic and transcriptional profiles were integrated to discover within CNAs candidate cancer genes with coordinately altered gene copy number and profiling of breast cancer cell lines identified one luminal and two A and B subtypes Luminal lines displayed an estrogen receptor ER signature and resembled

between hospital volume and hospital clinical resources and between both of these factors to mortality to help explain this study reviewed publicly available hospital information from the Leapfrog Group HealthGrades and hospital Web sites Hospitals were evaluated for Leapfrog ICU staffing criteria and Safe Practice Score HealthGrades rating for complex gastrointestinal procedures and operations and presence of a general surgery residency gastroenterology fellowship and interventional radiology Evaluation used trend analysis and multiple logistic regression analysis The second part determined the mortality rate for pancreaticoduodenectomy using inpatient mortality data from the National Inpatient Sample and Leapfrog Hospitals were categorized by low volume or high volume or strong clinical support presence of all support factors and weak clinical support absence of any factor Data were correlated by number of pancreatic resections per hospital hospital system clinical resources and operative hospital volume increased statistically significant increases occurred in the frequency of hospitals meeting Leapfrog ICU staffing criteria p Leapfrog Safe Practice Score p HealthGrades rating p general surgery residency p gastroenterology fellowship p and interventional radiology services p No significant relationships were found between resection volume and any one of the clinical support factors and perioperative death Presence of strong clinical support was associated with lower mortality odds ratio p clinical resources were more influential in operative mortality for pancreatic resection This might help explain why hospitals surgeons in institutions and some hospitals with excellent clinical resources have lower perioperative mortality rates for pancreatic

collateral pathway for cerebral blood flow Carotid artery stenting CAS typically crosses the ECA while carotid endarterectomy CEA includes deliberate ECA plaque removal The purpose of the present study was to compare the patency of the ECA following CAS and CEA as determined by carotid duplex ultrasounds and hospital records were reviewed for consecutive patients undergoing CAS between February 2002 and April 2008 and were compared with those undergoing CEA in the same time period Preoperative and postoperative ECA peak systolic velocities were normalized to the common carotid artery CCA as ratios A significant 80 or greater ECA stenosis was defined as an ratio of A change of ratio by more than 1 was defined as significant Data were analyzed using Student t test and χ 2 total of 86 CAS procedures in 83 patients were performed 81 men mean age years Among them of patients had previous CEA of whom had contralateral internal carotid artery occlusion CAS and 65 CEA patients with complete duplex data in the same time period were included in the analyses There was no difference in the incidence of severe ECA stenosis on preoperative ultrasound evaluations During a mean of 34 months range four to 78 months three postprocedure ECA occlusions were found in the CAS group The likelihood of severe stenosis or occlusion following CAS was compared with 11 following CEA P However 62 of CEA patients and 57 of CAS patients had no significant change in ECA status Reduction in the patient degree of ECA stenosis was observed in of CAS versus of CEA patients Overall immediate postoperative ratios of both groups were slightly improved but there was a trend of more disease progression in the CAS group during is associated with a higher incidence of ECA stenosis

Triage Tool A Perspective JOURNAL OF INFECTION AND CRITICAL CARE Purtill Benedict Brundage Kritayakirana Sherck Garland Spain A 2008 65 6 Abstract Triage of the trauma patient in the field is a complex and challenging issue especially deciding when to use aeromedical transport The American College of Surgeons Committee on Trauma recently defined an acceptable rate seriously injured patient not taken to a trauma center TC as 5 whereas rates may be as high as 25 to 50 Effective utilization of prehospital helicopter transport requires both accurate assessment of patients and effective communication The rural county adjacent to our developed trauma system uses standardized triage criteria to identify patients for direct transport to our TCs We hypothesized these criteria accurately identify major trauma victims MTV and further that communication could be simplified to expedite personnel use a MAP mechanism anatomy and physiology scoring system to triage trauma patients Patients with or 2 hits are defined as MTV In 2004 the triage policy was changed so that MTV would be transported directly to a TC without base hospital consultation previously required The Emergency Medical Services EMS Medical Director reviewed cases transported to the TC to determine the appropriateness of triage decisions and using the American College of Surgeons Committee on Trauma definitions Data were compared before and after this policy 2004 to 2006 we evaluated 676 air transports to TC and compared them to 468 in the prior 56 months The overall transport rate increased slightly 7 to 10 During the study period the rate was 31 compared with 21 before the policy change The MAP triage tool yielded a sensitivity and a specificity Therefore it determined the need for transport out of a rural environment into an established trauma system with 90 personnel can accurately use a trauma triage tool to identify MTV Eliminating base station contact a potential for introducing communication error did increase but still well within accepted limits The system change also resulted in the transport of a greater proportion of minor trauma patients who later proved to have major injuries View

mortality rates of any cancer type Discovering the full spectrum of molecular genetic alterations may suggest new avenues for therapy To catalogue genomic alterations we carried out genomic profiling of 31 exocrine pancreatic cancers and 6 distal bile duct cancers expanded as xenografts to enrich the tumor cell fraction We identified numerous focal DNA amplifications and deletions including in 19 of pancreatobiliary cases gain at cytoband a locus uncommonly amplified in other tumor types The smallest shared amplification at included GATA6 a transcriptional regulator previously linked to normal pancreas development When amplified GATA6 was overexpressed at both the mRNA and protein levels and strong immunostaining was observed in 25 of 54 46 primary pancreatic cancers compared to 0 of 33 normal pancreas specimens surveyed GATA6 expression in xenografts was associated with specific microarray patterns enriched for GATA binding sites and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation activity siRNA mediated knockdown of GATA6 in pancreatic cancer cell lines with amplification led to reduced cell proliferation cell cycle progression and colony formation Our findings indicate that GATA6

one linked to clinically favorable behavior and the others and linked with a more aggressive form of the disease To explore disease heterogeneity at the genomic level we carried out comparative genomic hybridization array CGH on 64 prostate tumor specimens including 55 primary tumors and 9 pelvic lymph node metastases Unsupervised cluster analysis of DNA copy number alterations CNA identified recurrent aberrations including a group associated with gene expression patterns and decreased tumor recurrence Supervised analysis further disclosed distinct patterns of CNA among subtypes where tumors exhibited characteristic deletions at 5q21 and 6q15 and cases harbored deletions at 8p21 and 21q22 resulting in fusion Lymph node metastases predominantly displayed overall higher frequencies of CNA and in particular gains at 8q24 MYC and 16p13 and loss at 10q23 PTEN and 16q23 Our findings reveal that prostate cancers develop via a limited number of alternative preferred

development and progression of lung cancer To identify such novel alterations in small cell lung cancer SCLC we performed comparative genomic hybridization on a set of 24 SCLC cell lines using cDNA microarrays representing approximately human genes providing an average mapping resolution of 70 kb We identified localized DNA amplifications corresponding to oncogenes known to be amplified in SCLC including MYC 8q24 MYCN 2p24 and MYCL1 1p34 Additional highly localized DNA amplifications suggested candidate oncogenes not previously identified as amplified in SCLC including the antiapoptotic genes TNFRSF4 1p36 DAD1 14q11 BCL2L1 20q11 and BCL2L2 14q11 Likewise newly discovered homozygous deletions suggested candidate genes including the proapoptotic genes MAPK10 4q21 and TNFRSF6 10q23 To characterize the effect of DNA amplification on gene expression patterns we performed expression profiling using the same microarray platform Among our findings we identified sets of genes whose expression correlated with MYC MYCN or MYCL1 amplification with surprisingly little overlap among gene sets While both MYC and MYCN amplification were associated with increased and decreased expression of known MYC upregulated and downregulated targets respectively MYCL1 amplification was associated only with the latter Our findings support a role of altered apoptotic balance in the pathogenesis of SCLC and suggest that MYC family genes might affect oncogenesis through distinct sets of targets in particular implicating the importance of transcriptional repression View details for

fibrosis and fibrous intimal thickening in small arteries We identified approximately 500 genes that were differentially expressed among the three age groups Old kidneys appeared to have increased extracellular matrix turnover and a nonspecific inflammatory response combined with a reduction in processes dependent on energy metabolism and mitochondrial function Quantitative supervised bioinformatics analyses of adult and old kidney expression data correlated the expression of 255 gene profiles with renal pathology scores Microarray class prediction analysis PAM identified 50 unique genes that segregated old kidneys into two distinct clusters those more similar within age class OO 5 versus old kidneys more similar to adult kidneys OA 4 The expression of six functionally significant genes was further validated by quantitative reverse chain reaction FN1 MMP7 TNC SERPIN3A BPHL CSPG2 in the experiment group and subsequently confirmed independently in 17 additional old

Abstract formats offer a alternative to conventional comparative genomic hybridization CGH methods for assessing DNA copy number alteration CNA in human cancer For murine tumors array CGH should provide even greater advantage since murine chromosomes are more difficult to individually discern We report here the adaptation and evaluation of a cDNA CGH method for the routine characterization of CNAs in murine tumors using mouse cDNA microarrays representing approximately different genes thereby providing an average mapping resolution of 109 kb As a first application we have characterized CNAs in a set of 10 primary and recurrent lymphomas derived from a murine lymphoma model In primary lymphomas and more commonly in relapses we identified a recurrent genomic DNA loss at chromosome and recurrent amplifications at chromosome and chromosome the boundaries of which we defined with high resolution Further by profiling gene expression using the same microarray platform we identified within CNAs the relevant subset of candidate cancer genes displaying comparably altered expression including Mcl1 myeloid cell leukemia sequence 1 a highly expressed antiapoptotic gene residing within the chr 3 amplicon peak CGH on mouse cDNA microarrays therefore represents a reliable method for the characterization of CNAs in murine tumors and a powerful approach for elucidating the molecular

Abstract Many soft tissue tumors recapitulate features of normal connective tissue We hypothesize that different types of fibroblastic tumors are representative of different populations of fibroblastic cells or different activation states of these cells We examined two tumors with fibroblastic features solitary fibrous tumor SFT and fibromatosis DTF by DNA microarray analysis and found that they have very different expression profiles including significant differences in their patterns of expression of extracellular matrix genes and growth factors Using immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization on a tissue microarray we found that genes specific for these two tumors have mutually specific expression in the stroma of nonneoplastic tissues We defined a set of 786 gene spots whose pattern of expression distinguishes SFT from DTF In an analysis of DNA microarray gene expression data from 295 previously published breast carcinomas we found that expression of this gene set defined two groups of breast carcinomas with significant differences in overall survival One of the groups had a favorable outcome and was defined by the expression of DTF genes The other group of tumors had a poor prognosis and showed variable expression of genes enriched for SFT type Our findings suggest that the host stromal response varies significantly among carcinomas and that gene

West Corless Ou Rubin Chu Leung Yuen Zhu Montgomery Nielsen Patel Goldblum Heinrich Fletcher J van de Rijn 2004 23 47 Abstract Most GISTs require oncogenic activation of the KIT or PDGFRA receptor tyrosine kinase proteins and the genomic mechanisms of oncogene activation are heterogeneous Notably the kinase mutation type correlates with both tumor biology and imatinib response For example GISTs with KIT exon 11 mutations are typically gastric and have excellent imatinib response whereas those with KIT exon 9 mutations generally arise in the small bowel and are less responsive to imatinib To identify genes that might contribute to these biological differences we carried out gene expression profiling of 26 GISTs with known KIT and PDGFRA mutational status Expression differences were then evaluated further by RNA in situ hybridization immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting Unsupervised hierarchical clustering grouped tumors with similar mutations together but the distinction between the different groups was not absolute Differentially expressed genes included ezrin p70S6K and PKCs which are known to have key roles in KIT or PDGFRA signaling and which might therefore contribute to the distinctive clinicopathological features in GISTs with different mutation types These gene products could serve as highly selective therapeutic targets in GISTs containing the KIT or PDGFRA mutational types with which they are associated View details for DOI View details for PubMedID 15326474 Apo D in soft tissue tumors a novel marker for dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans vol 28 pg 1063

Immunohistochemical and clinical characterization of the subtype of invasive breast carcinoma CLINICAL CANCER RESEARCH Nielsen Hsu Jensen Cheang Karaca Hu Livasy Cowan Dressler Akslen Ragaz GOWN Gilks

outcomes Currently there exist clinical assays that identify and tumors and we sought to develop a clinical assay for breast identify an immunohistochemical profile for breast tumors we collected a series of known tumors and tested them for protein patterns that are characteristic of this subtype Next we examined the significance of these protein patterns using tissue microarrays and evaluated the prognostic significance of these a panel of 21 tumors which was determined using gene expression profiles we saw that this subtype was typically immunohistochemically negative for estrogen receptor and HER2 but positive for basal cytokeratins HER1 Using breast carcinoma tissue microarrays representing 930 patients with mean basal cytokeratin expression was associated with low survival HER1 expression was observed in 54 of cases positive for basal cytokeratins versus 11 of negative cases and was associated with poor survival independent of nodal status and size expression was more common in tumors than in other breast cancers but did not influence panel of four antibodies ER HER1 HER2 and cytokeratin can accurately identify tumors using standard available clinical tools and shows high specificity These studies show that many tumors express HER1 which suggests candidate drugs for evaluation in these patients View details for Web of Science ID 000223454600011 View details

Goldblum Brown van de Rijn 2004 28 8 Abstract Using gene microarray expression profiling we previously found that apolipoprotein D Apo D was highly expressed in dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans DFSP In this study we confirm that Apo D is highly and relatively specifically expressed in DFSP using immunohistochemistry A tissue microarray containing 421 soft tissue tumors was constructed and stained with antibodies against Apo D and CD34 Cytoplasmic immunostaining for Apo D was found in 9 of 10 typical DFSPs In addition 3 of 3 Bednar tumors and 2 of 3 giant cell fibroblastomas stained in conventional sections In contrast Apo D was immunoreactive in only a very small subset of a diverse collection of other soft tissue tumors including Malignant Fibrous Histiocytoma MFH glomus tumor neurofibroma and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors Immunostains for Apo D were negative in conventional sections of 16 fibrous histiocytomas and an additional 12 variants of fibrous histiocytoma Digital images of all immunohistochemical and hematoxylin and eosin tissue microarray stains are available at the accompanying website http We conclude that Apo D is strongly expressed in DFSPs and neural lesions and may be useful in differentiating DFSP from fibrous histiocytoma View details for PubMedID 15252314 gene duplication and loss in human and great ape evolution PLOS BIOLOGY

and loss in human and great ape evolution PLoS biology Fortna Kim MacLaren Marshall Hahn Meltesen Brenton Hink Burgers Glueck McGavran Berry Pollack Sikela 2004 2 7 Abstract Given that gene duplication is a major driving force of evolutionary change and the key mechanism underlying the emergence of new genes and biological processes this study sought to use a novel approach to identify genes that have undergone duplications or contractions among several hominoid lineages Interspecies cDNA comparative genomic hybridization was used to individually compare copy number variation for cDNAs representing human genes across five hominoid species including human We identified genes either as isolated genes or in clusters positionally biased toward genomic regions that produced relative hybridization signals unique to one or more of the hominoid lineages Measured as a function of the evolutionary age of each lineage genes showing copy number expansions were most pronounced in human 134 and include a number of genes thought to be involved in the structure and function of the brain This work represents to our knowledge the first survey of gene duplication across hominoid species The genes identified here likely represent a significant majority of the major gene copy number changes that have occurred over the past 15 million years of human and great ape evolution and are likely to underlie some of the key phenotypic characteristics that distinguish these species View details for PubMedID 15252450 View details for PubMedCentralID PMC449870 comparative genomic hybridization for distinguishing Spitz nevi and melanomas DIAGNOSTIC MOLECULAR PATHOLOGY Harvell Kohler Zhu Pollack van de Rijn 2004 13 1 Abstract Distinguishing between Spitz nevus and melanoma presents a challenging task for clinicians and pathologists Most of these lesions are submitted entirely in formalin for histologic analysis by conventional hematoxylin and sections and material for ancillary studies is rarely collected Molecular techniques such as comparative genomic hybridization CGH can detect chromosomal alterations in tumor DNA that differ between these 2 lesions This study investigated the ability of CGH to serve as a diagnostic test in distinguishing Spitz nevus and melanoma using DNA isolated from and samples Two of 3 Spitz nevi exhibited no significant chromosomal alterations while the third showed gain of the short arm of chromosome 11p The latter finding has previously been described as characteristic of a subset of Spitz nevi The 2 melanomas showed multiple copy number alterations characteristic of melanoma such as 1q amplification and chromosome 9 deletion This study has shown the utility of CGH as a potential molecular test in distinguishing Spitz nevus from melanoma The assay is capable of using archival material is technically easier to perform as compared with conventional CGH is more sensitive than conventional CGH in being able to detect focal alterations and can detect copy number alterations even with relatively small amounts of lesional tissue as is typical of many skin tumors View details for PubMedID 15163005 Gene expression

163 6 Abstract Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans DFSP is an aggressive spindle cell neoplasm It is associated with the chromosomal translocation t which fuses the COL1A1 and PDGFbeta genes We determined the characteristic gene expression profile of DFSP and characterized DNA copy number changes in DFSP by comparative genomic hybridization array CGH Fresh frozen and samples of DFSP were analyzed by array CGH four cases and DNA microarray analysis of global gene expression nine cases The nine DFSPs were readily distinguished from 27 other diverse soft tissue tumors based on their gene expression patterns Genes characteristically expressed in the DFSPs included PDGF beta and its receptor PDGFRB APOD MEOX1 PLA2R and PRKCA Array CGH of DNA extracted either from frozen tumor samples or from paraffin blocks yielded equivalent results Large areas of chromosomes 17q and 22q bounded by COL1A1 and PDGF beta respectively were amplified in DFSP Expression of genes in the amplified regions was significantly elevated Our data shows that 1 DFSP has a distinctive gene expression profile 2 array CGH can be applied successfully to frozen or tumor samples 3 a characteristic amplification of sequences from chromosomes 17q and 22q demarcated by the COL1A1 and PDGF beta genes respectively was associated with elevated expression of the amplified genes View details for PubMedID 14633610 Gene

van de Rijn Teng Longacre Botstein Brown Sikic I 2003 14 11 Abstract We used DNA microarrays to characterize the global gene expression patterns in surface epithelial cancers of the ovary We identified groups of genes that distinguished the clear cell subtype from other ovarian carcinomas grade I and II from grade III serous papillary carcinomas and ovarian from breast carcinomas Six clear cell carcinomas were distinguished from 36 other ovarian carcinomas predominantly serous papillary based on their gene expression patterns The differences may yield insights into the worse prognosis and therapeutic resistance associated with clear cell carcinomas A comparison of the gene expression patterns in the ovarian cancers to published data of gene expression in breast cancers revealed a large number of differentially expressed genes We identified a group of 62 genes that correctly classified all 125 breast and ovarian cancer specimens Among the best discriminators more highly expressed in the ovarian carcinomas were PAX8 paired box gene 8 mesothelin and EFNB1 Although estrogen receptor was expressed in both the ovarian and breast cancers genes that are coregulated with the estrogen receptor in breast cancers including and binding protein 1 did not show a similar pattern of coexpression in the ovarian cancers View details for PubMedID 12960427 Identification of

mutation data and structural analysis of the TP53 tumor suppressor protein HUMAN MUTATION Martin Facchiano Cuff Olivier Hainaut Thornton 2002 19 2 Abstract TP53 encodes p53 which is a nuclear phosphoprotein with properties In response to DNA damage p53 is activated and mediates a set of antiproliferative responses including arrest and apoptosis Mutations in the TP53 gene are associated with more than 50 of human cancers and 90 of these affect interactions resulting in a partial or complete loss of transactivation functions These mutations affect the structural integrity interactions leading to the partial or complete loss of the protein function We report here the results of a systematic automated analysis of the effects of p53 mutations on the structure of the core domain of the protein We found that 304 of the 882 distinct mutations reported in the core domain can be explained in structural terms by their predicted effects on protein folding or on contacts The proportion of explained mutations increased to when substitutions of evolutionary conserved amino acids were included The automated method of structural analysis developed here may be applied to other frequently

from smokers Review of mutations compiled in the IARC p53 database ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH PERSPECTIVES Hainaut 1998 106 7 Abstract Mutations in the p53 gene are common in lung cancer Using data from the the International Agency for Research on Cancer p53 mutation database R1 we have analyzed the distribution and nature of p53 mutations in 876 lung tumors described in the literature These analyses confirm that G to T transitions are the predominant type of p53 mutation in lung cancer from smokers The most frequently mutated codons include 157 158 179 248 249 and 273 and several of them 157 248 and 273 have been shown to correspond to sites of in vitro DNA adduct formation by metabolites of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons PAHs such as benzo a pyrene Furthermore most of the base changes at codons 248 249 and 273 in lung cancer differ from those commonly observed at these codons in other cancers reported in the database Thus lung cancer from smokers shows a distinct unique p53 mutation spectrum that is not observed in lung cancer from nonsmokers These results further strengthen the association between active smoking exposure to PAHs and lung cancer They also indicate that a different pattern of mutations occurs in nonsmokers and this observation may help to identify other agents causally involved in lung cancer in nonsmokers View details for Web of Science ID

these mutations was initiated by Hollstein and Harris in 1990 This database originally consisted of a list of somatic point mutations in the p 53 gene of human tumors and cell lines compiled from the published literature and made available in a standard electronic form The database is maintained at the International Agency for Research on Cancer IARC and updated versions are released twice a year January and July The current version July 1997 contains records on 6800 published mutations and will surpass the 8000 mark in the January 1998 release The database now contains information on somatic and germline mutations in a new format to facilitate data retrieval In addition new tools are constructed to improve data analysis such as a Mutation Viewer Java applet developed at the European Bioinformatics Institute EBI to visualise the location and impact of mutations on p53 protein structure The database is available in different electronic formats at IARC http or from the EBI server http The IARC p53 website also provides reports on database analysis and links with other p53 sites as well as with related databases In this report we describe the criteria for inclusion of data the
