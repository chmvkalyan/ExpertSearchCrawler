biology and cancer Chen lab investigates the molecular mechanisms that underlie tissue patterning and tumorigenesis guided by chemical principles and enabled by chemical technologies For example the Chen group has developed inhibitors of Hedgehog signaling a biochemical pathway that is required for multiple aspects of embryonic development and contributes to human cancer Among these compounds are the first specific inhibitors of cytoplasmic dyneins microtubule motors that regulate a signaling organelle called the primary cilium Members of the lab have also synthesized photoactivatable antisense oligonucleotides that allow gene expression to be suppressed with spatiotemporal precision By applying these tools in zebrafish embryos they have elucidated the transcriptional programs that regulate formation of the notochord somites and other mesodermal recently the Chen group collaborated with the Harbury lab to devise new methods for lanthanide microscopy This approach takes advantage of the photoluminescence of lanthanide chelates and it enables ultrasensitive imaging of whole organisms Current research interests in the lab include modulators of stem cell metabolism optogenetic

investigate the molecular mechanisms that control tissue formation regeneration and malignancy Our research group is currently focused on three major areas 1 and genetic regulators of Hedgehog signaling 2 chemical tools for studying tissue patterning at the molecular and systems levels and 3 animal models of development and interest in the Hedgehog pathway arises from its critical role in the embryonic patterning of multiple tissues Aberrant Hedgehog pathway activation in children and adults is also linked to several cancers including those of the skin brain and blood Since the cellular events that transduce the Hedgehog signal from the cell surface to the nucleus are not well understood we have pursued genetic and screens for new Hedgehog pathway modulators with novel modes of action These studies will provide insights into the basic mechanisms of Hedgehog signal transduction as well as targets and chemical leads for new efforts to develop new tools for in vivo biology have focused on the zebrafish models exploiting the rapid ex utero development amenability to both chemical and genetic perturbations and optical transparency of this vertebrate For example we have developed caged antisense oligonucleotides and photoactivatable proteins that afford precise spatiotemporal control of developmental signaling pathways We have also devised new methods for lanthanide microscopy enabling ultrasensitive imaging In conjunction with genetic approaches these chemical technologies can open new windows into the molecular mechanisms that control vertebrate development and recently we have initiated studies of spermatogenesis using rodent models Our investigations explore how the kinase HIPK4 promotes male fertility and our findings indicate that this signaling protein is required for spermatid elongation Our goals are to elucidate how this kinase and its substrates regulate the cytoskeletal forces that remodel the spermatid nucleus and to develop inhibitors In principle such antagonists could provide safe and reversible male contraception Courses Chemical and Systems Biology Pizza TalksCSB 224 Aut Win Spr Sum Research SeminarCSB 270 Aut Win Spr Responsible

eLife Crapster J Rack Hellmann Le Adams Leib Elias Perrino Behr Li Lin Zeng Chen 2020 9 Abstract Mammalian spermiogenesis is a remarkable cellular transformation during which round spermatids elongate into spermatozoa The signaling pathways that coordinate this process are not well understood and we demonstrate here that protein kinase 4 HIPK4 is essential for spermiogenesis and male fertility in mice HIPK4 is predominantly expressed in round and early elongating spermatids and Hipk4 knockout males are sterile exhibiting phenotypes consistent with oligoasthenoteratozoospermia Hipk4 mutant sperm have reduced oocyte binding and are incompetent for in vitro fertilization but they can still produce viable offspring via intracytoplasmic sperm injection Optical and electron microscopy of male germ cells reveals defects in the filamentous actin acroplaxome during spermatid elongation and abnormal head morphologies in mature spermatozoa We further observe that HIPK4 overexpression induces branched structures in cultured fibroblasts and that HIPK4 deficiency alters the subcellular distribution of an capping protein in the testis supporting a role for this kinase in cytoskeleton

that exceed those of conventional fluorescence microscopes since they are limited by inefficient lanthanide excitation the low photon flux of excited lanthanide luminophores and background

control Development Cambridge England Mruk Ciepla Piza Alnaqib Chen 2020 Abstract Cell ablation is a powerful method for elucidating the contributions of individual cell populations to embryonic development and tissue regeneration Targeted cell loss in whole organisms has been typically achieved through expression of a cytotoxic or gene product in the cell type of interest This approach depends on the availability of promoters and it does not allow further spatial selectivity within the region s To address this limitation we have utilized the GAVPO transactivator in combination with two genetically encoded technologies the system and a cytotoxic variant of the M2 ion channel Our studies establish ablative methods that provide the tissue specificity afforded by elements and the conditionality of optogenetics Our studies also demonstrate differences between the nitroreductase and M2 systems that influence their efficacies for specific applications Using this integrative

control of gene expression in whole organisms While cMOs are usually triggered by light of a single wavelength the introduction of spectrally distinct chromophores can enable combinatorial regulation of multiple genes This chapter describes the general principles and methods of cMO design and synthesis from commercially available reagents Synthetic protocols for the linkers and the cMO assembly are described in detail as well as the microinjection and photoactivation techniques Following these protocols spectrally separated cyclic cMOs for multiple genes of interest can be prepared enabling

adhesion kinase Biology open Gutzman Graeden Brachmann Yamazoe Chen Sive 2018 Abstract Basal constriction occurs at the zebrafish boundary constriction MHBC and is likely a widespread morphogenetic mechanism 3D reconstruction demonstrates that MHBC cells are and initially constrict basally with subsequent apical expansion wnt5b is expressed in the MHB and is required for basal constriction Consistent with a requirement for this pathway expression of dominant negative Gsk3beta overcomes wnt5b knockdown Immunostaining identifies focal adhesion kinase Fak as active in the MHB region and knockdown demonstrates Fak is a regulator of basal constriction Tissue specific knockdown further indicates that Fak functions cell autonomously within the MHBC Fak acts downstream of wnt5b suggesting that Wnt5b signals locally as an early step in basal constriction and acts together with more widespread Fak activation This study delineates signaling pathways that regulate basal constriction during brain morphogenesis View details for PubMedID 30305282 Correcting dehydrogenase deficiency with a activator Nature communications Hwang Mruk Rahighi Raub Chen Dorn Horikoshi Wakatsuki Chen 2018 9 1 4045 Abstract dehydrogenase G6PD deficiency one of the most common human genetic enzymopathies is caused by over 160 different point mutations and contributes to the severity of many acute and chronic diseases associated with oxidative stress including hemolytic anemia and neurological damage particularly in newborns As no medications are available to treat G6PD deficiency here we seek to identify a small molecule that corrects it Crystallographic study and mutagenesis analysis identify the structural and functional defect of one common mutant Canton R459L Using screening we subsequently identify AG1 a small molecule that increases the activity of the the Canton mutant and several other common G6PD mutants AG1 reduces oxidative stress in cells and zebrafish Furthermore AG1 decreases or oxidative stress in human erythrocytes Our study suggests that a pharmacological agent of which AG1 may be a lead will likely alleviate the challenges associated with G6PD deficiency View details

screen for Hedgehog signaling by engineering selection of cells and applying gene disruption The screen can robustly identify factors required for ciliary signaling with few false positives or false negatives Characterization of hit genes uncovered novel components of several ciliary structures including a protein complex that contains and and is required for centriole maintenance The screen also provides an unbiased tool for classifying ciliopathies and showed that many congenital heart disorders are caused by loss of ciliary signaling Collectively our study enables a systematic analysis of ciliary function and of ciliopathies and also defines a versatile platform for dissecting signaling pathways through screening View details for PubMedID 29459677 Ultrasensitive optical imaging with

their ultrasensitive detection in biological systems by optical microscopy In practice however lanthanide imaging techniques have provided no better sensitivity than conventional fluorescence microscopy Here we identified three fundamental problems that have impeded lanthanide microscopy low photon flux inefficient excitation and background luminescence We overcame these limitations with a new lanthanide imaging modality transreflected illumination with luminescence resonance energy transfer trLRET which increases the signal intensities of lanthanide lumiphores by and the ratios by We demonstrate that trLRET provides at least an increase in detection sensitivity over that of conventional epifluorescence microscopy when used to visualize endogenous protein expression in zebrafish embryos We also show that trLRET can be used to optically detect molecular interactions in vivo trLRET promises to unlock the full potential of lanthanide lumiphores for ultrasensitive biological

Spadetail is an essential regulator of paraxial mesoderm development in zebrafish Danio rerio Mesodermal progenitor cells MPCs fail to differentiate into trunk somites in tbx16 mutants and instead accumulate within the tailbud in an immature state However the mechanisms by which Tbx16 controls mesoderm patterning have remained enigmatic We describe here the use of photoactivatable morpholino oligonucleotides to determine the Tbx16 transcriptome in MPCs We identified 124 genes that were expressed in zebrafish gastrulae including several developmental signaling proteins and regulators of gastrulation myogenesis and somitogenesis Unexpectedly we observed that a loss of Tbx16 function precociously activated posterior hox genes in MPCs and overexpression of a single posterior hox gene was sufficient to disrupt MPC migration Our studies support a model in which Tbx16 regulates the timing of collinear hox gene activation to coordinate the fates and positions of paraxial MPCs View

Steinman J Miller Cupido Zalyte Carter Nachury Kapoor Chen 2016 11 1 Abstract Cytoplasmic dyneins 1 and 2 are related members of the superfamily ATPases associated with diverse cellular activities that function as the predominant microtubule motors in eukaryotic cells Dynein 1 controls mitotic spindle assembly organelle movement axonal transport and other cytosolic processes whereas dynein 2 mediates retrograde trafficking within motile and primary cilia inhibitors are important tools for investigating motor mechanisms and ciliobrevins were recently discovered as the first chemical antagonists Here we demonstrate that ciliobrevins directly target the heavy chains of both dynein isoforms and explore the landscape of these inhibitors in vitro and in cells In addition to identifying chemical motifs that are essential for dynein blockade we have discovered analogs with increased potency and dynein 2 selectivity These antagonists effectively disrupt Hedgehog signaling

of Veratrum californicum wildflowers by pregnant ewes leading to the discovery of cyclopamine as a teratogen The precise mechanism of cyclopamine action remained enigmatic for 30 years until this steroid alkaloid was found to be the first specific inhibitor of Hedgehog Hh signalling and a direct antagonist of the transmembrane receptor Smoothened SMO In addition to being a valuable probe of Hh

Floor Plate Development ACS chemical biology Payumo Walker McQuade Yamazoe Chen 2015 10 6 Abstract In addition to their roles in mesoderm development the zebrafish transcription factors no tail a ntla and spadetail are required for medial floor plate MFP formation Posterior MFP cells are completely absent in zebrafish embryos lacking both Ntla and Spt function and genetic mosaic analyses have shown that the two genes promote MFP development in a manner On the basis of these observations it has been proposed that signals are required for the induction of posterior but not anterior MFP cells To investigate the mechanisms by which Ntla and Spt regulate MFP development we have used photoactivatable caged morpholinos cMOs to silence these genes with spatiotemporal control We find that posterior MFP formation requires Ntla or Spt activity during early gastrulation specifically in lateral cells that converge toward the midline during epiboly and somitogenesis Nodal MFP specification is maintained in the absence of Ntla and Spt function however midline cells in ntla spt morphants exhibit aberrant morphogenetic movements resulting in their anterior mislocalization Our findings indicate that Ntla and Spt do not differentially regulate MFP induction along the axis rather the genes act redundantly within cells to promote the posterior extension of MFP progenitors View details

pancreatic cancer progression Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America Lee Perera Wang Wu Liu Han Fitamant Jones Ghanta Kawano Nagle Deshpande Boucher Kato Chen Willmann Bardeesy Beachy A 2014 111 30 Abstract Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma PDA is the most lethal of common human malignancies with no truly effective therapies for advanced disease Preclinical studies have suggested a therapeutic benefit of targeting the Hedgehog Hh signaling pathway which is activated throughout the course of PDA progression by expression of Hh ligands in the neoplastic epithelium and paracrine response in the stromal fibroblasts Clinical trials to test this possibility however have yielded disappointing results To further investigate the role of Hh signaling in the formation of PDA and its precursor lesion pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia PanIN we examined the effects of genetic or pharmacologic inhibition of Hh pathway activity in three distinct genetically engineered mouse models and found that Hh pathway inhibition accelerates rather than delays progression of oncogenic disease Notably pharmacologic inhibition of Hh pathway activity affected the balance between epithelial and stromal elements suppressing stromal desmoplasia but also causing accelerated growth of the PanIN epithelium In striking contrast pathway activation using a small molecule agonist caused stromal hyperplasia and reduced epithelial proliferation These results indicate that stromal response to Hh signaling is protective against PDA and that pharmacologic activation of pathway response can slow tumorigenesis Our results provide evidence for a restraining role of stroma in PDA progression suggesting an explanation for the failure of Hh inhibitors in clinical trials and pointing to the possibility of a novel type of therapeutic intervention View details for DOI View details for PubMedID 25024225 activation of Gli transcription factors Proceedings

activation and transcription play critical roles in embryonic patterning tissue homeostasis and tumorigenesis By conducting a cDNA overexpression screen we have identified the Rho GAP family member Arhgap36 as a positive regulator of the Hh pathway in vitro and in vivo Arhgap36 acts in a Smoothened Smo manner to inhibit Gli repressor formation and to promote the activation of Gli proteins

Kapoor Khodjakov A 2014 206 2 Abstract Segregation of genetic material occurs when chromosomes move to opposite spindle poles during mitosis This movement depends on specialized microtubule MT bundles attached to the chromosomes kinetochores A assumption is that continuous connect every kinetochore to a spindle pole and the force for chromosome movement is produced at the kinetochore and coupled with MT depolymerization However we found that chromosomes still maintained their position at the spindle equator during metaphase and segregated properly during anaphase when one of their was severed near the kinetochore with a laser microbeam We also found that in normal fully assembled spindles of some chromosomes did not extend to the spindle pole These connected to adjacent nonkinetochore MTs Poleward movement of chromosomes with short was uncoupled from MT depolymerization at the kinetochore Instead these chromosomes moved by transport of the entire assembly Thus at least two distinct

transcription factor that is essential for vascular differentiation and morphogenesis in vertebrates While recent data suggest that Etv2 is dynamically regulated during vascular development little is known about the mechanisms involved in this process Here we find that etv2 transcript and protein expression are highly dynamic during zebrafish vascular development with both apparent during early somitogenesis and subsequently as development proceeds Inducible knockdown of Etv2 in zebrafish embryos prior to stages but not later caused severe vascular defects suggesting a specific role in early commitment of lateral mesoderm to the endothelial linage Accordingly cells showed an enhanced ability to commit to endothelial lineages in mosaic embryos We further find that the etv2 3 untranslated region UTR is capable of repressing an endothelial autonomous transgene and contains binding sites for members of the family of microRNAs Ectopic expression of could repress the etv2 in sensor assays and was also able to block endogenous Etv2 protein expression leading to concomitant reduction of endothelial genes Finally we observed that Etv2 protein levels persisted in dicer1 mutant embryos suggesting that microRNAs contribute to its repression during vascular development Taken together our results suggest that etv2 acts during early development to specify endothelial lineages and is then in part through repression by microRNAs to allow normal vascular development View details for DOI View details for Web of Science ID 000326901100011 View details for PubMedID 24036310 View

centrosome to the center of the immunological synapse IS to drive polarized secretion in the direction of the bound target cell Using an optical trap for spatial and temporal control over target presentation we show that centrosome repositioning in Jurkat T cells exhibited kinetically distinct polarization and docking phases and required calcium flux and signaling through both the T cell receptor and integrin to be robust In frustrated conjugates where the centrosome is stuck behind the nucleus the center of the IS invaginated dramatically to approach the centrosome Consistently imaging of microtubules during normal repositioning revealed a microtubule mechanism operating at the center of the IS In agreement with this mechanism centrosome repositioning was impaired by inhibiting microtubule depolymerization or dynein We conclude that dynein drives centrosome repositioning in T cells via microtubule operating at the center of the IS and not cortical sliding at the

framework controlled NMII localization directly by phosphorylating inhibitory sites within the myosin regulatory light chain thereby suppressing NMII clustering in the region of TCR stimulation Concurrently phosphorylation of distinct sites within myosin regulatory light chain by Rho kinase drove NMII clustering in areas behind the centrosome These results reveal a role for NMII in polarity

diverse cellular activities ATPases is integral to cellular processes including DNA replication protein unfolding cargo transport and membrane fusion The ATPase motor cytoplasmic dynein regulates ciliary trafficking mitotic spindle formation and organelle transport and dissecting its precise functions has been challenging because of its rapid timescale of action and the lack of chemical modulators Here we describe the discovery of ciliobrevins the first specific antagonists of cytoplasmic dynein Ciliobrevins perturb protein trafficking within the primary cilium leading to their

distinctly modified histones by specialized proteins constitutes a key mechanism for transducing molecular events at chromatin to biological outcomes Effector proteins influence processes including transcription DNA recombination and DNA repair however no effector functions have yet been identified within the mammalian machinery that regulate DNA replication Here we show that ORC1 a component of ORC origin of replication complex which mediates replication licensing contains a bromo adjacent homology BAH domain that specifically recognizes histone H4 dimethylated at lysine 20 H4K20me2 Recognition of H4K20me2 is a property common to BAH domains present within diverse metazoan ORC1 proteins Structural studies reveal that the specificity of the BAH domain for H4K20me2 is mediated by a dynamic aromatic cage and multiple intermolecular contacts involving the bound peptide H4K20me2 is enriched at replication origins and abrogating ORC1 recognition of H4K20me2 in cells impairs ORC1 occupancy at replication origins ORC chromatin loading and progression Mutation of the ORC1 BAH domain has been implicated in the aetiology of syndrome MGS a form of primordial dwarfism and ORC1

cord neurons DEVELOPMENT England Batista Mich Chen Lewis 2011 138 23 Abstract In mouse Hedgehog Hh signalling is required for most ventral spinal neurons to form Here we analyse the spinal cord phenotype of zebrafish smoothened MZsmo mutants that completely lack Hh signalling We find that most V3 domain cells and motoneurons are lost whereas medial floorplate still develops normally and V2 V1 and V0v cells form in normal numbers This phenotype resembles that of mice that lack both Hh signalling and Gli repressor activity Ventral spinal cord progenitor domain transcription factors are not expressed at 24 hpf in zebrafish MZsmo mutants However pMN p2 and p1 domain markers are expressed at early somitogenesis stages in these mutants This suggests that Gli repressor activity does not extend into zebrafish ventral spinal cord at these stages even in the absence of Hh signalling Consistent with this ectopic expression of Gli3R represses ventral progenitor domain expression at these early stages and knocking down Gli repressor activity rescues later expression We investigated whether retinoic acid RA signalling specifies ventral spinal neurons in the absence of Hh signalling The results suggest that RA is required for the correct number of many different spinal neurons to form This is probably mediated in part by an effect on cell proliferation However V0v V1 and V2 cells are still present even in the absence of both Hh and RA signalling We demonstrate that Gli1 has a role in specifying most of the remaining motoneurons and V3 domain cells in embryos that lack Hh

phenotype of zebrafish that lack maternal and zygotic contributions of the Hh signaling transducer Smoothened MZsmo mutants and therefore are completely devoid of pathway activation Some functional primary motoneurons PMNs persist in the absence of Hh signaling and we find that their induction requires both basal Gli transcription factor activity and retinoic acid RA signaling We also provide evidence that RA pathway activation can modulate Gli function in a Hh manner These findings support a model in which Hh and RA signaling cooperate to promote PMN cell fates in zebrafish View details

Milenkovic Gephart Teruel Oro Chen Scott 2011 25 22 Abstract The Hedgehog Hh pathway is essential for vertebrate embryogenesis and excessive Hh target gene activation can cause cancer in humans Here we show that Neuropilin 1 Nrp1 and Nrp2 transmembrane proteins with roles in axon guidance and vascular endothelial growth factor VEGF signaling are important positive regulators of Hh signal transduction Nrps are expressed at times and locations of active Hh signal transduction during mouse development Using cell lines lacking key Hh pathway components we show that Nrps mediate Hh transduction between activated Smoothened Smo protein and the negative regulator Suppressor of Fused SuFu Nrp1 transcription is induced by Hh signaling and Nrp1 overexpression increases maximal Hh target gene activation indicating the existence of a positive feedback circuit The regulation of Hh signal transduction by Nrps is conserved between mammals and bony fish as we show that morpholinos targeting the Nrp zebrafish ortholog nrp1a produce a specific and highly penetrant Hh pathway phenotype These findings enhance our knowledge of Hh pathway regulation and provide evidence for a

Blaser Thomas Firestone Yelon Raz Chen 2009 328 2 Abstract Primordial germ cells PGCs are the progenitors of reproductive cells in metazoans and are an important model for the study of cell migration in vivo Previous reports have suggested that Hedgehog Hh protein acts as a chemoattractant for PGC migration in the Drosophila embryo and that downstream signaling proteins such as Patched Ptc and Smoothened Smo are required for PGC localization to somatic gonadal precursors Here we interrogate whether Hh signaling is required for PGC migration in vertebrates using the zebrafish as a model system We find that cyclopamine an inhibitor of Hh signaling causes strong defects in the migration of PGCs in the zebrafish embryo However these defects are not due to inhibition of Smoothened Smo by cyclopamine rather we find that neither maternal nor zygotic Smo is required for PGC migration in the zebrafish embryo Cyclopamine instead acts independently of Smo to decrease the motility of zebrafish PGCs in part by dysregulating cell adhesion and uncoupling cell polarization and translocation These results demonstrate that Hh signaling is not required for zebrafish PGC migration and

the suppression which results in activation of Hh targets Smo is a protein with a long carboxyl terminal tail Vertebrate Smo has been previously shown to be coupled to Galpha i proteins but the biological significance of the coupling in Hh signal transduction is not clear Here we show that although inhibition of Galpha i protein activity appears to significantly reduce Hh pathway activity in Ptc mouse embryonic fibroblasts and the cells it fails to derepress or a inhibition of Gli3 protein processing a known in vivo indicator of Hh signaling activity The inhibition of Galpha i protein activity also can not block the Sonic Hedgehog Shh specification of neural progenitor cells in the neural tube Consistent with these results overexpression of a constitutively active Galpha i protein

through activation of the transcription factor Gli The activity of mammalian Smoothened is controlled by three different hedgehog proteins Indian Desert and Sonic hedgehog through their interaction with the Smoothened inhibitor Patched However the mechanisms of signal transduction from Smoothened are poorly understood We show that a kinase which regulates signaling by many conventional 7TM

knockdown of endogenous GRK2 by short hairpin RNA shRNA significantly reduces signaling in response to the Smoothened agonist SAG and also inhibits signaling induced by an oncogenic Smoothened mutant Smo M2 We find that GRK2 promotes the association between active Smoothened and 2 Indeed signaling mediated by coexpression of Smoothened and GRK2 is diminished by 2 knockdown with shRNA Together

purmorphamine was previously found to activate the Hh pathway and affect osteoblast differentiation through an unknown mechanism We demonstrate here that purmorphamine directly targets Smoothened a

and GRK2 SCIENCE Chen Ren Nelson Barak Chen Beachy de Sauvage Lefkowitz J 2004 306 5705 Abstract Binding of Sonic Hedgehog Shh to Patched Ptc relieves the latter tonic inhibition of Smoothened Smo a receptor that spans the cell membrane seven times This initiates signaling which by unknown mechanisms regulates vertebrate developmental processes We find that two molecules interact with mammalian Smo in an manner G receptor kinase 2 GRK2 leads to phosphorylation of Smo and 2 fused to green fluorescent protein interacts with Smo These two processes promote endocytosis of Smo in pits Ptc inhibits association of 2 with Smo and this inhibition is relieved in cells treated with Shh A Smo agonist stimulated and a Smo antagonist cyclopamine inhibited both phosphorylation of Smo by GRK2 and interaction of 2 with Smo 2 and GRK2 are thus potential mediators of signaling by activated Smo View details for DOI View details for Web of Science ID 000225950000047 View details for PubMedID 15618519 Inhibition of Hedgehog signaling by direct binding of cyclopamine to Smoothened GENES DEVELOPMENT Chen Taipale Cooper Beachy A 2002 16 21 Abstract The steroidal alkaloid cyclopamine has both teratogenic and antitumor activities arising from its ability to specifically block cellular responses to vertebrate Hedgehog signaling We show here using photoaffinity and fluorescent derivatives that this inhibitory effect is mediated by direct binding of cyclopamine to the heptahelical bundle of Smoothened Smo Cyclopamine also can reverse the retention of partially misfolded Smo in the endoplasmic reticulum presumably through effects on protein conformation These observations reveal the mechanism of cyclopamine teratogenic and antitumor activities and further suggest a role for small molecules in the physiological regulation of Smo View details for DOI View details for Web of Science ID 000179027900002 View details for PubMedID 12414725 View details for PubMedCentralID PMC187469 Small molecule modulation of Smoothened activity PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA Chen Taipale Young Maiti Beachy A 2002 99 22 Abstract Smoothened Smo a distant relative of G receptors mediates Hedgehog Hh signaling during embryonic development and can initiate or transmit pathway activation in tumorigenesis Although the cellular mechanisms that regulate Smo function remain unclear the direct inhibition of Smo by cyclopamine a steroidal alkaloid suggests that endogenous small molecules may be involved Here we demonstrate that SAG a Hh pathway agonist binds to the Smo heptahelical bundle in a manner that antagonizes cyclopamine action In addition we have identified four small molecules that directly inhibit Smo activity but are structurally distinct from cyclopamine Functional and biochemical studies of these compounds provide evidence for the small molecule modulation of Smo through multiple mechanisms and yield insights into the physiological regulation of Smo activity The mechanistic differences between the Smo antagonists may be useful in the therapeutic manipulation of Hh signaling View details for DOI

Berman Karhadkar Hallahan Pritchard Eberhart Watkins Chen Cooper Taipale Olson Beachy A 2002 297 5586 Abstract Constitutive Hedgehog Hh pathway activity is associated with initiation of neoplasia but its role in the continued growth of established tumors is unclear Here we investigate the therapeutic efficacy of the Hh pathway antagonist cyclopamine in preclinical models of medulloblastoma the most common malignant brain tumor in children Cyclopamine treatment of murine medulloblastoma cells blocked proliferation in vitro and induced changes in gene expression consistent with initiation of neuronal differentiation and loss of neuronal stem character This compound also caused regression of murine tumor allografts in vivo and induced rapid death of cells from freshly resected human medulloblastomas but not from other brain tumors thus establishing a specific role for Hh pathway activity in medulloblastoma growth View details for Web of Science ID 000177697300059 View details for

cell carcinoma medulloblastoma rhabdomyosarcoma and other human tumours are associated with mutations that activate the Smoothened SMO or that inactivate the tumour suppressor Patched PTCH Smoothened and Patched mediate the cellular response to the Hedgehog Hh secreted protein signal and oncogenic mutations affecting these proteins cause excess activity of the Hh response pathway Here we show that the teratogen cyclopamine which inhibits the Hh response is a potential therapeutic agent for treatment of these tumours We show that cyclopamine or synthetic derivatives with improved potency block activation of the Hh response pathway and abnormal cell growth associated with both types of oncogenic mutation Our results also indicate that cyclopamine may act by influencing the balance between active and inactive forms of Smoothened View details for Web of Science ID 000089020200048 View details for PubMedID 10984056 The identification of proteins vol 6 pg 221 1999 CHEMISTRY BIOLOGY Chen

the structure was phased by single isomorphous replacement and anomalous scattering SIRAS As expected the domain is a compact beta barrel with an confirmation very similar to the independently determined NMR structures The structure illuminates a discrepancy between the two NMR structures on the conformation of the loop region unique to P13K SH3 Furthermore the ligand binding pockets of P13K SH3 domain are occupied by amino acid residues from P13K SH3 molecules the residues I 82 SPP of one and R18 of another The interaction modes clearly resemble those observed for the P13K SH3 domain complexed with the synthetic peptide RLP1 a class 1 ligand although there are significant differences The interactions suggest a model of aggregation that could be mediated by SH3 domains View

structures of two Src homology 3 SH3 complexes have been determined by nuclear magnetic resonance Each complex consists of the SH3 domain and a peptide selected from a large library of ligands prepared by combinatorial synthesis The bound ligands adopt a polyproline type II PPII helix although the amino to carboxyl directionalities of their helices are opposite The peptide orientation is determined by a salt bridge formed by the terminal arginine residues of the ligands and the conserved of the SH3 domain Residues at positions 3 4 6 and 7 of both peptides also intercalate into the site however the respective proline and nonproline residues show exchanged binding positions in the two complexes These structural results led to a model for the interactions of SH3 domains with peptides that can be used to predict critical residues in complexes of unknown structure The model was used to identify correctly both the binding orientation and the contact and noncontact residues of a peptide derived from the nucleotide exchange factor Sos in association with the SH3 domain of the adaptor protein Grb2 View details for Web of Science ID A1994PT13200054 View details for PubMedID

STRUCTURAL BASIS FOR THE BINDING OF PEPTIDES TO SH3 DOMAINS CELL Yu Chen Feng Dalgarno Brauer Schreiber 1994 76 5 Abstract A common RXL motif was found in ligands that were selected from a biased combinatorial peptide library on the basis of their ability to bind specifically to the SH3 domains from phosphatidylinositol PI3K or The solution structure of the PI3K SH3 domain complexed to one of these ligands RKLPPRPSK RLP1 was determined mutations were introduced into the PI3K SH3 domain and the RLP1 ligand and the influence of these mutations on binding was evaluated We conclude that SH3 domains recognize motifs possessing the type II polyproline PPII helix conformation Two proline residues directly contact the receptor Other prolines in the ligands appear to function as a molecular scaffold promoting the formation of the PPII helix Three nonproline residues consisting of combinations of arginine and leucine interact extensively with the SH3 domain and appear to confer ligand

measured by AGE agree with those determined in homogeneous solution by spectrophotometric measurements This technique has been used to investigate the influence of the length of the spacer separating the ligand and the polyacrylamide backbone on the binding constants Dissociation constants obtained using the affinity gels approach the values measured in free solution when the spacer is sufficiently long or 18 A affinity ligands having short spacers give high apparent dissociation constants View details for Web of Science ID A1993LC09800005 View details for PubMedID 8517543 Molecular
