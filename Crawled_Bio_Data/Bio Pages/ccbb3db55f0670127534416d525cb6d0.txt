Research Scholarship Teaching Publications Bio Our laboratory at the Stanford Institute for Stem Cell Biology Regenerative Medicine and the Department of Developmental Biology aspires to understand how different human develop from stem cells and how developing tissues incipiently take shape and form To this end we have delineated a comprehensive roadmap that describes how embryonic stem cells can develop into a spectrum of over twenty different human cell types This roadmap enabled us to generate rather uniform populations of human liver progenitors bone progenitors and heart progenitors from embryonic stem cells each of which could regenerate their cognate tissue upon injection into respective mouse models This platform to produce these engraftable human tissue progenitors provides fundamental building blocks for regenerative medicine and provides an ideal venue to understand human developmental biology In particular we are interested in questions regarding cellular signaling

opportunity has yet to be fully realized because differentiation often yields heterogeneous mixtures of cells that are for molecular analysis or cell have developed a reductionist system to define the minimal essential inductive and repressive signals necessary for the developmental induction of a given embryonic lineage from differentiating ESCs These efforts culminated in systematic roadmaps describing the extrinsic signals that guide human ESCs into a variety of endoderm and mesoderm germ layer derivatives including liver intestinal bone and heart progenitors through a series of

2020 11 1 2713 Abstract Despite their therapeutic potential human pluripotent stem cell hPSC cell therapies continue to have serious safety risks Transplantation of cell populations into preclinical models has generated teratomas tumors arising from undifferentiated hPSCs unwanted tissues and other types of adverse events Mitigating these risks is important to increase the safety of such therapies Here we use genome editing to engineer a general platform to improve the safety of future cell transplantation therapies Specifically we develop hPSC lines bearing two safeguards which have distinct functionalities and address separate safety concerns In vitro administration of one small molecule depletes undifferentiated hPSCs thus preventing teratoma formation in vivo Administration of a second small molecule kills all thus providing an option to eliminate the entire cell product in vivo if adverse events arise These orthogonal safety switches address major safety concerns with

Epstein J Kundaje Talbot Beachy Ang Weissman 2016 166 2 Abstract differentiation to desired lineages requires navigating alternating developmental paths that often lead to unwanted cell types Hence comprehensive developmental roadmaps are crucial to channel differentiation toward desired fates To this end here we map bifurcating lineage choices leading from pluripotency to 12 human mesodermal lineages including bone muscle and heart We defined the extrinsic signals controlling each binary lineage decision enabling us to logically block differentiation toward unwanted fates and rapidly steer pluripotent stem cells toward 80 pure human mesodermal lineages at most branchpoints This strategy enabled the generation of human bone and heart progenitors that could engraft in respective in vivo models Mapping stepwise chromatin and gene expression changes in mesoderm development uncovered somite segmentation a previously unobservable human embryonic event transiently marked by HOPX

the apex of the hierarchy of developmental potential They are capable of generating all cell types of the mammalian body proper Therefore they are the exemplar of stem cells In vivo pluripotent cells exist transiently and become expended within a few days of their establishment Yet when explanted into artificial culture conditions they can be indefinitely propagated in vitro as pluripotent stem cell lines A host of transcription factors and regulatory genes are now known to underpin the pluripotent state Nonetheless how pluripotent cells are equipped with their vast multilineage differentiation potential remains elusive Consensus holds that pluripotency transcription factors prevent differentiation by inhibiting the expression of differentiation genes However this does not explain the developmental potential of pluripotent cells We have presented another emergent perspective namely that pluripotency factors function as lineage specifiers that enable pluripotent cells to differentiate into specific lineages therefore endowing pluripotent cells with their multilineage potential Here we provide a comprehensive overview of the developmental biology transcription factors and extrinsic signaling associated with pluripotent cells and their accompanying subtypes in vitro heterogeneity and chromatin states Although much has been learned since the appreciation of mammalian pluripotency in the 1950s and the derivation of embryonic stem cell lines in 1981 we will specifically emphasize what currently remains unclear However the view that pluripotency factors capacitate differentiation recently corroborated by experimental evidence might perhaps address the question of how pluripotent cells are endowed with their multilineage differentiation potential View details

Abstract Stem cells fuel tissue development renewal and regeneration and these activities are controlled by the local stem cell microenvironment the niche Wnt signals emanating from the niche can act as factors for stem cells in multiple mammalian tissues Wnt proteins are which constrains them to act as cellular signals The locality of Wnt signaling dictates that stem cells exiting the Wnt signaling domain differentiate spatially delimiting the niche in certain tissues In some instances stem cells may act as or generate their own niche enabling the of patterned tissues In this Review we discuss the various ways by which Wnt operates in stem cell control and in doing so identify an integral program for tissue renewal and regeneration View details for DOI View details for PubMedID

populations Knowledge of signals controlling embryonic lineage bifurcations could efficiently yield desired cell types through exclusion of alternate fates Therefore we revisited signals driving induction and patterning of definitive endoderm to generate a coherent roadmap for endoderm differentiation With striking temporal dynamics BMP and Wnt initially specified anterior primitive streak progenitor to endoderm yet 24 hr later suppressed endoderm and induced mesoderm At lineage bifurcations signals separated mutually exclusive fates and respectively induced pancreas versus liver from endoderm by suppressing the alternate lineage We systematically blockaded alternate fates throughout multiple consecutive bifurcations thereby efficiently differentiating multiple hPSC lines exclusively into endoderm and its derivatives Comprehensive transcriptional and chromatin mapping of highly pure endodermal populations revealed that endodermal enhancers existed in a surprising

Precarious Balance Pluripotency Factors as Lineage Specifiers CELL STEM CELL Loh Lim B 2011 8 4 Abstract Understanding the basis of the unrestricted multilineage differentiation potential of pluripotent cells will be of developmental and translational consequence We propose that pluripotency transcription factors are lineage specifiers that direct commitment to specific fetal lineages Individual factors bestow the ability to differentiate into particular cell types and concomitant expression of multiple lineage specifiers within pluripotent cells enables differentiation into every fetal lineage Moreover we speculate that rather than being an intrinsically stable ground state pluripotency is an inherently precarious condition in which rival lineage specifiers continually compete to specify differentiation along mutually exclusive lineages View details for DOI View details for Web of Science ID 000289707100008 View details for PubMedID 21474100 microdeletion imparts

Vacuum Society Cui Engel Dundes Nguyen Loh Dunn 2020 38 3 033205 Abstract The ability to harness the processes by which complex tissues arise during embryonic development would improve the ability to engineer complex tissuelike constructs in longstanding goal of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine In embryos uniform populations of stem cells are exposed to spatial gradients of diffusible extracellular signaling proteins known as morphogens Varying levels of these signaling proteins induce stem cells to differentiate into distinct cell types at different positions along the gradient thus creating spatially patterned tissues Here the authors describe two straightforward and microfluidic strategies to expose human pluripotent stem cells in vitro to spatial gradients of desired extracellular signals Both approaches afford a high degree of control over the distribution of extracellular signals while preserving the viability of the cultured stem cells The first microfluidic platform is commercially available and entails static culture whereas the second microfluidic platform requires fabrication and dynamic fluid exchange In each platform the authors first computationally modeled the spatial distribution of extracellular signals Then the authors used each platform to expose human pluripotent stem cells to a gradient of these signals in this case inducing a cell type known as the primitive streak resulting in a regionalized culture with differentiated primitive streak cells predominately localized on one side and undifferentiated stem cells at the other side of the device By combining this approach with a fluorescent reporter for differentiated cells and fluorescence imaging the authors characterized the spatial and temporal dynamics of primitive streak differentiation within the induced signaling gradients Microfluidic approaches to create precisely controlled morphogen gradients will add to the stem cell and developmental biology toolkit and may eventually pave the way to create increasingly spatially patterned tissuelike constructs in vitro View details for DOI View details for PubMedID 32255900 View details for

substances secretes vital proteins and executes key metabolic activities thus sustaining life Consequently liver can be caused by chronic alcohol intake hepatitis acute poisoning or other a severe condition that can culminate in bleeding jaundice coma and eventually death However approaches to treat liver failure as well as studies of liver function and disease have been stymied in part by the lack of a plentiful supply of human liver cells To this end this protocol details the efficient differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells hPSCs into cells guided by a developmental roadmap that describes how liver fate is specified across six consecutive differentiation steps By manipulating developmental signaling pathways to promote liver differentiation and to explicitly suppress the formation of unwanted cell fates this method efficiently generates populations of human liver bud progenitors and cells by days 6 and 18 of PSC differentiation respectively This is achieved through the control of developmental signaling pathways exerted by small molecules and growth factors in a culture medium Differentiation in this system occurs in monolayers and yields cells that express characteristic hepatocyte enzymes and have the ability to engraft a mouse model of chronic liver failure The ability to efficiently generate large numbers of human liver cells in vitro has

Multipotent haematopoietic stem cells HSCs regenerate the adult blood system after transplantation1 which is a curative therapy for numerous diseases including immunodeficiencies and leukaemias2 Although substantial effort has been applied to identifying HSC maintenance factors through the characterization of the in vivo HSC microenvironment or stable ex vivo HSC expansion has previously been Here we describe the development of a defined culture system that supports the ex vivo expansion of functional mouse HSCs We used a systematic optimization approach and found that high levels of thrombopoietin synergize with low levels of factor and fibronectin to sustain HSC Serum albumin has long been recognized as a major source of biological contaminants in HSC cultures8 we identify polyvinyl alcohol as a functionally superior replacement for serum albumin that is compatible with good manufacturing practice These conditions afford between and expansions of functional HSCs over

cells into desired cell types and organoids Wiley interdisciplinary reviews Developmental biology Fowler Ang Loh 2019 e368 Abstract Too many choices can be problematic This is certainly the case for human pluripotent stem cells hPSCs they harbor the potential to differentiate into hundreds of cell types yet it is highly challenging to exclusively differentiate hPSCs into a single desired cell type This review focuses on unresolved and fundamental questions regarding hPSC differentiation and critiquing the identity and purity of the resultant cell populations These are timely issues in view of the fact that cell populations have or are being transplanted into patients in over 30 ongoing clinical trials While many in vitro differentiation protocols purport to mimic development the exact number and identity of intermediate steps that a pluripotent cell takes to differentiate into a given cell type in vivo remains largely unknown Consequently most differentiation efforts inevitably generate a heterogeneous cellular population as revealed by and other analyses The presence of unwanted cell types in differentiated hPSC populations does not portend well for transplantation therapies This provides an impetus to precisely control differentiation to desired instance by logically blocking the formation of unwanted cell types or by overexpressing transcription by harnessing technologies to selectively purify desired cell types Conversely approaches to differentiate organoids from hPSCs intentionally generate heterogeneous cell populations While this is intended to mimic the rich cellular diversity of developing tissues whether all such organoids are spatially organized in a manner akin to native organs and thus whether they fully qualify as organoids remains to be

for liver failure is the transplantation of a new liver However intravenously transplanting a suspension of human hepatocytes might be a approach to partially reconstitute lost liver functions in human patients as evinced by promising outcomes in clinical trials The purpose of this essay is to emphasize outstanding questions that continue to surround hepatocyte transplantation While adult primary human hepatocytes are the gold standard for transplantation hepatocytes are heterogeneous Whether all hepatocytes engraft equally and what specifically defines an engraftable hepatocyte capable of liver reconstitution remains unclear To this end mouse models of liver injury enable the evaluation of human hepatocytes and their behavior upon transplantation into a complex injured liver environment While mouse models may not be fully representative of the injured human liver and human hepatocytes tend to engraft mice less efficiently than mouse hepatocytes valuable lessons have nonetheless been learned from transplanting human hepatocytes into mouse models With an eye to the future it will be crucial to eventually detail the optimal biological source whether in or in and

How neural activity creates this motivation remains poorly understood We used genetic labeling to characterize neurons activated by water deprivation in the hypothalamic median preoptic nucleus MnPO transcriptional profiling revealed that MnPO neurons consist of a single excitatory cell type After optogenetic activation of these neurons mice drank water and performed an operant task for water reward with rates that scaled with stimulation frequency This stimulation was aversive and instrumentally pausing stimulation could reinforce Activity of these neurons gradually decreased over the

Imaging Reveals that the First Division of Differentiating Human Embryonic Stem Cells Often Yields Asymmetric Fates Cell reports Brown Loh Nusse 2017 21 2 Abstract How do stem cells respond to signals to initiate differentiation Here we show that despite uniform exposure to extracellular signals individual human embryonic stem cells hESCs respond heterogeneously To track how hESCs incipiently exit pluripotency we established a system to differentiate hESCs as single cells and conducted live imaging to track their very first cell division We followed the fate of their earliest daughters as they remained undifferentiated or differentiated toward the primitive streak the earliest descendants of pluripotent cells About 30 of the time hESCs divided to yield one primitive streak and one undifferentiated daughter The undifferentiated daughter cell was innately resistant to WNT signaling and could not respond to this differentiation signal Hence the first division of differentiating hESCs sometimes yields daughters with diverging fates with implications for the efficiency of directed differentiation protocols and the underlying rules of lineage commitment View details for

show that mouse multipotent embryonic lung progenitors can be isolated and expanded long term in 3D culture Cultured progenitors transcriptionally resemble their in vivo counterparts and generate both airway and alveolar cell types in vitro progenitors that were transplanted into injured adult mouse lungs differentiated into all major airway and alveolar lineages in vivo in a fashion We propose

Wu Weissman Nakauchi 2016 19 5 Abstract Cell types more advanced in development than embryonic stem cells such as EpiSCs fail to contribute to chimeras when injected into blastocysts apparently because the injected cells undergo apoptosis Here we show that transient promotion of cell survival through expression of the gene BCL2 enables EpiSCs and Sox17 endoderm progenitors to integrate into blastocysts and contribute to chimeric embryos Upon injection into blastocyst EpiSCs contributed to all bodily tissues in chimeric animals while Sox17 endoderm progenitors specifically contributed in a fashion to endodermal tissues In addition BCL2 expression enabled rat EpiSCs to contribute to mouse embryonic chimeras thereby forming interspecies chimeras that could survive to adulthood Our system therefore provides a method to overcome cellular compatibility issues that typically restrict chimera formation Application of this type of approach could broaden the use of embryonic chimeras

aminopeptidase A These three stromal subsets exhibit differential capacities to support hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells Although the subset demonstrates functional stem cell niche activity by maintaining primitive hematopoietic stem cell HSC renewal in vitro the other stromal populations promote HSC differentiation to more committed lines of hematopoiesis such as the lineage Gene expression analysis and microscopic studies further reveal a microenvironment in which and marrow stroma collaborate to provide cytokine signaling to HSCs and more committed hematopoietic progenitors As a result within the context of bone as a organ the BCSP plays a critical role in supporting hematopoiesis through its generation of diverse osteogenic and stroma including HSC supportive 6C3 niche

STEM CELL Ichida Blanchard Lam Son Chung Egli Loh Carter Di Giorgio Koszka Huangfu Akutsu Liu Rubin Eggan 2009 5 5 Abstract The combined activity of three transcription factors can reprogram adult cells into induced pluripotent stem cells iPSCs However the transgenic methods used for delivering reprogramming factors have raised concerns regarding the future utility of the resulting stem cells These uncertainties could be overcome if each transgenic factor were replaced with a small molecule that either directly activated its expression from the somatic genome or in some way compensated for its activity To this end we have used chemical screening to identify small molecules that can replace Sox2 in reprogramming We show that one of these molecules functions in reprogramming by inhibiting signaling in a stable and trapped intermediate cell type that forms during the process We find that this inhibition promotes the completion of reprogramming through induction of the transcription
