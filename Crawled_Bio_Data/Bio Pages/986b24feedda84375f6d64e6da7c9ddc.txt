Using Nonmyeloablative Host Conditioning With TLI ATG vs SOC in AML Not Recruiting Acute myeloid leukemia AML is a cancer of the bone marrow that mostly affects older adults Even with the best chemotherapy survival is achieved in a minority of patients Bone marrow transplantation from a sibling donor may improve cure rates however patients over 50 years of age have a high risk of complications and therefore generally are excluded from this treatment option Recently our group developed a transplantation strategy for older cancer patients that protects against complications yet does not interfere with the ability of the transplanted donor cells to destroy cancer cells With this new method we can now safely evaluate transplantation as a curative therapy for AML patients over the age of 50 We have assembled clinical and scientific researchers throughout the state of California to study and compare bone marrow transplantation using our new approach with the best standard of care chemotherapy in AML patients over the age of 50 The results of this study have the potential to establish a new treatment standard that will improve survival of older AML patients Stanford is

Merker Gotlib Levene Fire A 2017 7 Abstract Investigations aimed at defining the 3D configuration of eukaryotic chromosomes have consistently encountered an endogenous population of circular genomic DNA referred to as extrachromosomal circular DNA eccDNA While the production distribution and activities of eccDNAs remain understudied eccDNA formation from specific regions of the linear genome has profound consequences on the regulatory and coding capabilities for these regions Here we define eccDNA distributions in Caenorhabditis elegans and in three human cell types utilizing a set of DNA approaches for enrichment and characterization The use of parallel biophysical enzymatic and informatic approaches provides a comprehensive profiling of eccDNA robust to isolation and analysis methodology Results in human and nematode systems provide quantitative analysis of the eccDNA loci at both unique and repetitive regions Our studies converge on and support a consistent picture in which endogenous genomic DNA circles are present in normal physiological states and in which the circles come from both coding and noncoding genomic regions Prominent among the coding regions generating DNA circles are several genes known to produce a diversity of protein isoforms with mucin proteins and titin as specific examples View details for DOI View details for PubMedCentralID

V617F clonal hematopoiesis in the general population We recruited a cohort of 726 individuals with polycythemia vera essential thrombocythemia and myelofibrosis and 252 637 population controls unselected for hematologic phenotypes Using a polymorphism SNP array platform with custom probes for the JAK2 V617F mutation V617F we identified 497 individuals among the population controls who were V617F carriers We performed a combined GWAS of the MPN cases plus V617F carriers in the control population n 1223 vs the remaining controls who were noncarriers for V617F n 252 140 For these MPN cases plus V617F carriers we replicated the germ line JAK2 haplotype rs59384377 odds ratio OR P 10 previously associated with MPN We also identified significant associations in the TERT gene rs7705526 OR P 10 in SH2B3 rs7310615 OR P 10 and upstream of TET2 rs1548483 OR P 10 These associations were confirmed in a separate replication cohort of 446 V617F carriers vs 169 021 noncarriers In a joint analysis of the combined GWAS and replication results we identified additional significant predisposition alleles associated with CHEK2 ATM PINT and GFI1B All SNP ORs were similar for MPN patients and controls who were V617F carriers These data indicate that the same germ line variants endow individuals with a predisposition not only to MPN but also to JAK2 V617F clonal hematopoiesis a more common

Previous studies to determine incidence and prognostic significance of somatic mutations in CMML have relied on candidate gene sequencing although an unbiased mutational search has not been conducted As many of the genes commonly mutated in CMML were recently associated with clonal hematopoiesis ARCH and aged hematopoiesis is characterized by a myelomonocytic differentiation bias we hypothesized that CMML and aged hematopoiesis may be closely related We initially established the somatic mutation landscape of CMML by whole exome sequencing followed by validation Genes mutated in of patients were SRSF2 TET2 ASXL1 RUNX1 SETBP1 KRAS EZH2 CBL and NRAS as well as the novel CMML genes FAT4 ARIH1 DNAH2 and CSMD1 Most CMML patients 71 had mutations in ARCH genes and 52 had mutations overall Higher mutation burden was associated with shorter survival population incidence and reported ARCH mutation rates are consistent with a model in which clinical CMML ensues when a sufficient number of stochastically acquired mutations has accumulated suggesting that CMML represents the leukemic conversion of the aged hematopoietic system View details for DOI View details for PubMedID 26648538

mutations have been identified in the majority of chronic neutrophilic leukemia CNL and a smaller percentage of atypical chronic myeloid leukemia aCML cases Although CSF3R point mutations T618I are emerging as key players in the significance of rarer CSF3R mutations is unknown In this study we assess the importance of the CSF3R T640N mutation as a marker of and potential therapeutic sequencing of leukemia samples was performed to identify CSF3R mutations in CNL and aCML The oncogenicity of the CSF3R T640N mutation relative to the T618I mutation was assessed by cytokine independent growth assays and by mouse bone marrow transplant Receptor dimerization and of the mutants was assessed by Western blot and JAK inhibitor sensitivity was assessed by colony we identify a CSF3R T640N mutation in two patients with one of whom was originally diagnosed with MDS and acquired the T640N mutation upon evolution of disease to aCML The T640N mutation is oncogenic in cellular transformation assays and an in vivo mouse bone marrow transplantation model It exhibits many similar phenotypic features to T618I including ligand independence and altered patterns of the transmembrane location of T640 preventing access by GalNAc transferase enzymes Cells transformed by the T640N mutation are sensitive to JAK kinase inhibition to a similar degree as cells transformed by CSF3R of its similarities to

Nedoszytko Butterfield Gotlib Reiter Radia Hermine Sotlar George Kristensen Yavuz Hagglund Sperr Schwartz Triggiani Maurer Nilsson Horny Arock Orfao Metcalfe Akin Valent 2016 137 1 Abstract Cutaneous lesions in patients with mastocytosis are highly heterogeneous and encompass localized and disseminated forms Although a classification and criteria for cutaneous mastocytosis CM have been proposed there remains a need to better define subforms of cutaneous manifestations in patients with mastocytosis To address this unmet need an international task force involving experts from different organizations including the European Competence Network on Mastocytosis the American Academy of Allergy Asthma Immunology and the European Academy of Allergology and Clinical Immunology met several times between 2010 and 2014 to discuss the classification and criteria for diagnosis of cutaneous manifestations in patients with mastocytosis This article provides the major outcomes of these meetings and a proposal for a revised definition and criteria In particular we recommend that the typical maculopapular cutaneous lesions urticaria pigmentosa should be subdivided into 2 variants namely a monomorphic variant with small maculopapular lesions which is typically seen in adult patients and a polymorphic variant with larger lesions of variable size and shape which is typically seen in pediatric patients Clinical observations suggest that the monomorphic variant if it develops in children often persists into adulthood whereas the polymorphic variant may resolve around puberty This delineation might have important prognostic implications and its implementation in diagnostic algorithms and future mastocytosis classifications is recommended Refinements are also suggested for the diagnostic criteria of CM removal of telangiectasia macularis eruptiva perstans from the current classification of CM and removal of the adjunct solitary from the term solitary mastocytoma View

HEMATOLOGIC MALIGNANCY REPORTS Gotlib J 2015 10 4 Abstract World Health myeloproliferative neoplasms share a common pathobiologic theme of constitutive activation of tyrosine kinases TKs While neoplasms with eosinophilia and rearrangement of PDGFRA or PDGFRB exhibit exquisite responsiveness to imatinib other eosinophilic disorders such as chronic eosinophilic leukemia not otherwise specified and idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome HES lack recurrent gene mutations or known druggable targets In systemic mastocytosis SM KIT D816V is identified in 90 of patients but demonstrates imatinib resistance Recently the inhibitor midostaurin PKC412 has demonstrated encouraging activity in patients with advanced SM and selective KIT D816V inhibitors are entering clinical development rationale also exists for use of small molecule inhibitors of pathways BTK and FGFR1 that are implicated in normal or dysregulated signaling in eosinophils or mast cells A complementary therapeutic approach is the use of naked antibody mepolizumab and alemtuzumab or drug immunoconjugates brentuximab vedotin against targets expressed on the surface of eosinophils or mastocytes that can block proliferation induce apoptosis of these cells Ultimately biologic and molecular characterization of eosinophilia and SM cases will help to optimize selection of TK inhibitors or therapeutic antibodies

BMF is a cardinal feature of many myeloproliferative neoplasms MPNs and there is a documented association between the severity of BMF and overall prognosis We conducted an exploratory analysis of sequential BMF data from two phase I studies of treatment with the Janus kinase 2 JAK2 inhibitor fedratinib in patients with marrow samples were obtained at baseline and after every six cycles 24 weeks of daily fedratinib treatment Fibrosis was centrally assessed by three independent haematopathologists who were blinded to the patients data and graded according to European Consensus Myelofibrosis Grading Criteria The analysis population comprised patients with a baseline BMF grade and at least one BMF grade assessment Changes in BMF grade compared with baseline were classified as improvement grade reduction stabilisation no change in any baseline BMF grade 3 or worsening grade increase patients were included in the analysis A total of 153 bone marrow samples were analysed Improvement or stabilisation of BMF from baseline was recorded in 15 of 18 83 evaluable patients at cycle 6 and in four of nine 44 evaluable patients at cycle 30 Two patients achieved resolution of

mutations in genes encoding G protein α Gα subunits occur in of all human cancers but oncogenic alterations in Gβ subunits have not been defined Here we demonstrate that recurrent mutations in the Gβ proteins GNB1 and GNB2 confer growth and activate canonical G protein signaling Multiple mutations in GNB1 affect the protein interface that binds Gα subunits as well as downstream effectors and disrupt Gα interactions with the Gβγ dimer Different mutations in Gβ proteins clustered partly on the basis of lineage for example all 11 GNB1 K57 mutations were in myeloid neoplasms and seven of eight GNB1 I80 mutations were in B cell neoplasms Expression of GNB1 variants in mouse bone marrow followed by transplantation resulted in either myeloid or B cell malignancies In vivo treatment with the dual inhibitor BEZ235 suppressed signaling and markedly increased survival In several human tumors mutations in the gene encoding GNB1 with oncogenic kinase alterations including the fusion protein the V617F substitution in JAK2 and the V600K substitution in BRAF Coexpression of GNB1 variants with these mutant kinases resulted in inhibitor resistance in each context Thus GNB1 and GNB2 alterations confer transformed and resistance phenotypes across a range of human tumors and may be targetable with inhibitors of G protein signaling View details for DOI View details for PubMedID

Arock 2014 7 5 Abstract During the past few years a number of molecular markers have been developed in clinical hematology most of them related to specific gene defects However there is also an unmet need to develop novel serologic parameters to improve diagnostics and prognostication in daily practice Among these the serum tryptase appears to be a most reliable biomarker of myeloid neoplasms Elevated tryptase levels are found in subgroups of patients with mastocytosis myelodysplastic syndrome myeloproliferative neoplasm acute myeloid leukemia chronic myeloid leukemia and chronic eosinophilic leukemia In these patients the tryptase level is of diagnostic prognostic significance In mastocytosis an elevated tryptase level is a minor criterion of systemic disease and in chronic myeloid leukemia elevated tryptase at diagnosis correlates with treatment responses and overall survival In patients with elevated tryptase the enzyme also serves as parameter and can be employed to measure In the current article we review and update the perspectives of tryptase and provide recommendations for use of this conventional biomarker in daily practice View details for DOI View details

Transplantation for Myelofibrosis BIOLOGY OF BLOOD AND MARROW TRANSPLANTATION Gupta Gotlib Radich Kroeger Rondelli Verstovsek Deeg J 2014 20 9 Abstract Myelofibrosis MF is a manifestation of several disorders of hematopoiesis collectively referred to as myeloproliferative neoplasms Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ASCT is the only therapy with proven curative potential However most patients with MF are in their 6th or 7th decade of life and only some of these patients have been considered suitable transplantation candidates The development of conditioning regimens with limited toxicity has allowed clinicians to offer ASCT to a growing number of older patients The availability of Janus Kinase JAK inhibitors allows clinicians to provide symptom relief and improved quality of life for MF patients These drugs may also affect the decision regarding in particular the timing of ASCT Future studies need to address the role of inhibitors in patients who are transplantation candidates and determine their role before and possibly after transplantation The identification of indications for the use of inhibitors in the context of transplantation may lead to new therapeutic strategies for patients with MF View details for DOI View details for Web of Science ID 000340986200004 View details for PubMedID 24680977 Refined diagnostic criteria and

Ribosomal protein haploinsufficiency occurs in diverse human diseases including anemia DBA congenital asplenia and T cell leukemia Yet how mutations in genes encoding ubiquitously expressed proteins such as these result in and defects remains unknown Here we identify mutations in GATA1 encoding the critical hematopoietic transcription factor that reduce levels of GATA1 protein and cause DBA in rare instances We show that ribosomal protein haploinsufficiency the more common cause of DBA can lead to decreased GATA1 mRNA translation possibly resulting from a higher threshold for initiation of translation of this mRNA in comparison with other mRNAs In primary hematopoietic cells from patients with mutations in RPS19 encoding ribosomal protein S19 the amplitude of a transcriptional signature of GATA1 target genes was globally and specifically reduced indicating that the activity but not the mRNA level of GATA1 is decreased in patients with DBA associated with mutations affecting ribosomal proteins Moreover the defective hematopoiesis observed in patients with DBA associated with ribosomal protein haploinsufficiency could be partially overcome by increasing GATA1 protein levels Our results provide a paradigm by which selective defects in translation due to mutations affecting ubiquitous ribosomal proteins can result in human disease View details for DOI View details for PubMedID

associated with low serum erythropoietin EPO levels Secondary congenital erythrocytosis may be characterized by normal or high serum EPO levels and is related to high oxygen affinity haemoglobin variants mutation of the enzyme biphosphoglycerate mutase BPGM or defects in components of the pathway Hereditary thrombocytosis was first linked to mutations in genes encoding thrombopoietin THPO or the thrombopoietin receptor MPL More recently germline mutations in JAK2 distinct from JAK2 V617F and mutation of the gelsolin gene were uncovered in several pedigrees of hereditary thrombocytosis

PDGFRB and fibroblast growth factor FGFR1 are a group of hematologic neoplasms resulting from the formation of abnormal fusion genes that encode constitutively activated tyrosine kinases These entities are now separated into their own major category in the 2008 World Health Organization classification of hematolymphoid tumors Although eosinophilia is characteristic of these diseases the clinical presentation of the three entities is variable Conventional cytogenetics karyotyping will detect the majority of abnormalities involving PDGFRB and FGFR1 but florescence in situ hybridization FISH studies are required to detect factor interacting with PAP FIP1L1 as the characteristic 4q12 interstitial deletion is cryptic Imatinib mesylate imatinib is the therapy for patients with abnormalities of whereas patients with FGFR1 fusions are resistant to this therapy and carry a poor prognosis The discovery of novel gene rearrangements associated with eosinophilia will further guide

henceforth collectively referred to as advanced SM for the purposes of this report are typically characterized by organ damage and shortened survival duration In contrast to indolent SM in which symptoms are usually managed by noncytotoxic antimediator therapy cytoreduction is usually necessary for disease control in advanced SM Unfortunately current drug treatment of these patients rarely results in complete clinical and histopathologic remissions or improved survival time Previously defined response criteria were adapted to the heterogeneous presentations of advanced SM and the

Tyner Yang Bankhead Fan Fletcher Bryant Glover Chang Spurgeon Fleming Kovacsovics Gotlib Oh Deininger Zwaan den Boer van den Druker Loriaux 2013 73 1 Abstract Kinases are dysregulated in most cancers but the frequency of specific kinase mutations is low indicating a complex etiology in kinase dysregulation Here we report a strategy to rapidly identify functionally important kinase targets irrespective of the etiology of kinase pathway dysregulation ultimately enabling a correlation of patient genetic profiles to clinically effective kinase inhibitors Our methodology assessed the sensitivity of primary leukemia patient samples to a panel of 66 kinase inhibitors over 3 days Screening of 151 leukemia patient samples revealed a wide diversity of drug sensitivities with 70 of the clinical specimens exhibiting hypersensitivity to one or more drugs From this data set we developed an algorithm to predict kinase pathway dependence based on analysis of inhibitor sensitivity patterns Applying this algorithm correctly identified pathway dependence in specimens with known oncogenes including a rare FLT3 mutation outside regions covered by standard molecular diagnostic tests Interrogation of all 151 patient specimens with this algorithm identified a diversity of kinase targets and signaling pathways that could aid prioritization of deep sequencing data sets permitting a cumulative analysis to understand kinase pathway dependence within leukemia subsets In a case we showed that in vitro drug sensitivity could predict both a clinical response and the development of drug resistance Taken together our results suggested that drug target scores derived from a comprehensive kinase inhibitor panel could predict pathway dependence in cancer cells while simultaneously identifying potential therapeutic options View details for DOI View details for PubMedID 23087056 Management of cytopenias in patients with myelofibrosis treated with ruxolitinib and effect of dose

inhibitor approved in the US for the treatment of myelofibrosis MF Because thrombopoietin and erythropoietin signal through JAK2 cytopenias are expected with treatment In the COntrolled Myelofibrosis study with ORal JAK inhibitor Treatment I trial these cytopenias were effectively managed with dose adjustments These analyses were conducted to evaluate the relationship between ruxolitinib titrated doses and changes in platelet count and hemoglobin level as well as efficacy was a randomized trial in 309 patients with or MF and a platelet count 10 9 Ruxolitinib starting doses were 15 and 20 mg twice daily bis in die BID for patients with baseline platelet counts of 10 9 and 200 10 9 respectively Percentage changes from baseline to week 24 in spleen volume and symptoms were assessed in subgroups defined by final titrated dose average daily dose during weeks 21 to 24 median final titrated doses for patients starting at doses of 15 and 20 mg BID were 10 and 20 mg BID respectively at week 24 Most dose reductions occurred in the first weeks of treatment and coincided with decreases in platelet count and hemoglobin level Subsequently platelet counts stabilized and hemoglobin levels gradually returned to near baseline levels red blood cell transfusion rates followed a similar trend Final titrated doses of mg BID were associated with clinically meaningful improvements in symptoms that were comparable across doses while marginally greater reductions in spleen volume were observed at higher analysis shows that cytopenias were effectively managed with ruxolitinib dose adjustments and titrated doses of mg BID were associated with clinically meaningful reductions in spleen volume and symptom improvement at week 24 View details for DOI View details for PubMedID 24368888 ICON

circles In states such as allergic and inflammatory conditions contact and the pleiotropic actions of multiple cytokines and chemokines derived from local tissues or mast cells themselves foster the of these cells to the same geographic cellular niche While eosinophils and mast cells serve critical roles as part of the host immune response and in maintenance of normal homeostasis these cell types can undergo neoplastic transformation due to the development of clonal molecular abnormalities that arise in early hematopoietic progenitors The dysregulated tyrosine kinases D816V KIT and are the prototypic oncogenic lesions resulting in systemic mastocytosis SM and chronic eosinophilic leukemia respectively We review the pathobiology of these myeloproliferative neoplasms MPNs with a focus on the relationship between mast cells and eosinophils and discuss murine models which further elucidate how the phenotype of these diseases can be influenced by stem cell factor SCF and expression of the potent eosinophilopoietic cytokine Therapy of SM and disease and the prognostic relevance of increased peripheral blood and tissue mast cells in hematolymphoid malignancies will also be addressed

2012 5 2 Abstract Eosinophils and their products play an essential role in the pathogenesis of various reactive and neoplastic disorders Depending on the underlying disease molecular defect and involved cytokines hypereosinophilia may develop and may lead to organ damage In other patients persistent eosinophilia is accompanied by typical clinical findings but the causative role and impact of eosinophilia remain uncertain For patients with organ pathology early therapeutic intervention with agents reducing eosinophil counts can be effective in limiting or preventing irreversible organ damage Therefore it is important to approach eosinophil disorders and related syndromes early by using established criteria to perform all appropriate staging investigations and to search for molecular targets of therapy In this article we review current concepts in the pathogenesis and evolution of eosinophilia and organ damage in neoplastic and conditions In addition we discuss

American Society of Clinical Oncology Meeting Nguyen Gotlib J 2012 Abstract The molecular biology of the chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms MPNs has witnessed unprecedented advances since the discovery of the acquired JAK2 V617F mutation in 2005 Despite the high prevalence of JAK2 V617F in polycythemia vera PV essential thrombocythemia ET and primary myelofibrosis PMF and the common finding of dysregulated signaling in these disorders it is now appreciated that MPN pathogenesis can reflect the acquisition of multiple genetic mutations that alter several biologic pathways including epigenetic control of gene expression Although certain gene mutations are identified at higher frequencies with disease evolution to the blast phase MPN initiation and progression are not explained by a single temporal pattern of clonal changes A complex interplay between acquired molecular abnormalities and host genetic background in addition to the type and allelic burden of mutations contributes to the phenotypic heterogeneity of MPNs At the population level an inherited predisposition to developing MPNs is linked to a relatively common haplotype referred to as but it exhibits a relatively low penetrance This review details the current state of knowledge of the molecular genetics of the classic MPNs PV ET and PMF and discusses the clinical implications of these

transformation We here describe that Lyn and Btk are phosphorylated in a manner in neoplastic MCs in advanced SM and in the MC leukemia cell line Lyn and Btk activation was not only detected in KIT cells but also in the KIT subclone Moreover KIT D816V did not induce activation in cells and deactivation of KIT D816V by midostaurin did not alter activation siRNAs against Btk and Lyn were found to block survival in neoplastic MCs and to cooperate with midostaurin in producing growth inhibition Growth inhibitory effects were also obtained with 2 targeted drugs dasatinib which blocks KIT Lyn and Btk activation in MCs and bosutinib a drug that deactivates Lyn and Btk without blocking KIT activity Together signaling via contributes to growth of neoplastic MCs in advanced SM Dasatinib and

therapy is to mitigate organ damage For patients with milder forms of eosinophilia 3 without symptoms or signs of organ involvement a watch and wait approach with may be undertaken Identification of rearranged PDGFRA or PDGFRB is critical because of the exquisite responsiveness of these diseases to imatinib Corticosteroids are therapy for patients with hypereosinophilia and HES Hydroxyurea and have demonstrated efficacy as initial treatment and cases of HES In addition to hydroxyurea second line cytotoxic chemotherapy agents and hematopoietic cell transplant have been used for aggressive

Abstract LNK mutation analysis was performed in 61 patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms MPN myelofibrosis PMF in 41 vera in 11 and thrombocythemia in 9 patients Paired phase sample analysis was possible in 26 cases Nine novel heterozygous LNK mutations were identified in eight 13 patients six exon 2 missense mutations involving codons 215 220 223 229 and 234 a synonymous mutation involving codon 208 and two deletion mutations involving exon 2 or exon 5 eight affected the pleckstrin homology PH domain Mutations were detected in six samples sample analysis in four of these revealed the same mutation in one Mutant LNK was detected in only in two patients and in both phases in one JAK2V617F was documented in three and IDH2R140Q in one patients LNK mutations were not detected in 78 additional patients with MPN enriched for TET2 IDH JAK2V617F or cases We conclude that LNK mutations i target an exon 2 spot in the PH domain spanning residues ii might be more prevalent in PMF and

Dysregulated signaling is a hallmark of chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms MPNs as evidenced by the identification of the activating JAK2 V617F somatic mutation in almost all patients with polycythemia vera PV and of essential thrombocythemia and primary myelofibrosis patients These disorders are clinically distinct raising the question of how a single mutation can result in such phenotypic diversity Mouse models have demonstrated that the level of JAK2 V617F expression can modulate the phenotype and clinical studies of JAK2 V617F allele burden have reported similar findings It has also been hypothesized that one or more V617F events may modify the MPN phenotype However the molecular basis of JAK2 essential thrombocythemia and primary myelofibrosis remains largely unexplained Mutations in the TET2 gene have been identified in both JAK2 and MPNs and other myeloid neoplasms but their functional and clinical significance have yet to be clarified In addition recent reports have identified a specific germline haplotype that increases the predisposition to MPNs The role of inhibitory pathways SOCS and LNK in regulating signaling in MPNs is being increasingly

Hypereosinophilic Syndrome and Clonal Eosinophilia Diagnostic Algorithm and Treatment Update MAYO CLINIC PROCEEDINGS Tefferi Gotlib Pardanani A 2010 85 2 Abstract Acquired eosinophilia is operationally categorized into secondary clonal and idiopathic types Causes of secondary eosinophilia include parasite infections allergic or vasculitis conditions drugs and lymphoma Clonal eosinophilia is distinguished from idiopathic eosinophilia by the presence of histologic cytogenetic or molecular evidence of an underlying myeloid malignancy The World Health Organization classification system for hematologic malignancies recognizes 2 distinct subcategories of clonal eosinophilia chronic eosinophilic leukemia not otherwise specified and neoplasms with eosinophilia and mutations involving growth factor receptor or fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 Clonal eosinophilia might also accompany other World Health myeloid malignancies including chronic myelogenous leukemia myelodysplastic syndromes chronic myelomonocytic leukemia and systemic mastocytosis Hypereosinophilic syndrome a subcategory of idiopathic eosinophilia is defined by the presence of a peripheral blood eosinophil count of x 10 9 or greater for at least 6 months a shorter duration is acceptable in the presence of symptoms that require therapy exclusion of both secondary and clonal eosinophilia evidence of organ involvement and absence of phenotypically abnormal clonal T lymphocytes The presence of the latter defines lymphocytic variant hyper eosinophilia which is best classified under secondary eosinophilia In the current review we provide a simplified algorithm for distinguishing the various causes of clonal and idiopathic eosinophilia and discuss current therapy

quantification of JAK2 V617F may provide a method to monitor response to therapy For these reasons we designed a clinical assay that uses PCR and detection with hydrolysis probes for the quantification of JAK2 V617F JAK2 and GAPDH transcripts Mutant and JAK2 were quantified by using external plasmid standards that contain the relevant JAK2 V617F or JAK2 sequence respectively We tested 55 peripheral blood specimens from patients with suspected myeloproliferative neoplasms and 55 peripheral blood specimens from patients not known to have myeloproliferative neoplasms nonspecific amplification was detected in reactions containing a high copy number of plasmid standards and in specimens from patients not known to have myeloproliferative neoplasms necessitating the use of a mutant to cutoff The limit of detection established by using cell line dilutions is and this method identified three JAK2 patients who were not detected by a less sensitive method The assay characteristics and our initial evaluation indicate this method can be used for the detection and quantification of JAK2 V617F which should be useful for diagnosis of myeloproliferative neoplasms and

Current methods of protein detection are insensitive to detecting subtle changes in oncoprotein activation that underlie key cancer signaling processes The requirement for large numbers of cells

responsible for cancer progression and therapeutic resistance Chronic myeloid leukemia CML represents an important paradigm for understanding the genetic and epigenetic events involved in CSC production CML progresses from a chronic phase CP in hematopoietic stem cells HSC that harbor the translocation to blast crisis BC characterized by aberrant activation of within progenitors GMP A major barrier to predicting and inhibiting blast crisis transformation has been the identification of mechanisms driving activation Here we show that BC CML myeloid progenitors in particular GMP serially transplant leukemia in immunocompromised mice and thus are enriched for leukemia stem cells LSC Notably cDNA sequencing of pathway regulatory genes including adenomatous polyposis coli GSK3beta axin 1 lymphoid enhancer cyclin D1 and revealed a novel splice deletion of the GSK3beta kinase domain in the GMP of BC samples that was not detectable by sequencing in blasts or normal progenitors Moreover BC CML progenitors with misspliced GSK3beta have enhanced expression as well as serial engraftment potential while reintroduction of GSK3beta reduces both in vitro replating and leukemic engraftment We propose that CP CML is initiated by expression in an HSC clone but that progression to BC may include missplicing of GSK3beta in GMP LSC enabling unphosphorylated to participate in LSC Missplicing of GSK3beta represents a unique mechanism for the emergence of BC CML LSC and might provide a novel diagnostic and therapeutic target View details for DOI View details

benefit of time a more comprehensive picture has emerged regarding several characteristics of the fusion including its incidence biological features and the clinical profile of patients who carry the molecular rearrangement A few prospective trials have now better defined the natural history of patients from which some basic conclusions can be drawn the prognosis is outstanding acquired resistance is exceedingly rare but ongoing imatinib treatment is likely required to prevent relapse The emergence of genetically assigned eosinophilias has led the World Health Organization in 2008 to adopt a classification scheme with one subcategory named and lymphoid neoplasms with eosinophilia and abnormalities of PDGFRA PDGFRB or FGFR1 Molecular rearrangements involving other partner genes such as ETV6 and JAK2 have also been associated with eosinophilic disorders and will likely be assimilated into such classifications over time Despite the molecularly defined eosinophilias comprising a small

have implicated a role for angiogenesis in the pathogenesis of myelodysplastic syndrome MDS Although the role of angiogenesis inhibitors in the treatment of solid tumors has evolved significantly over the past 5 years their role in the treatment of hematologic malignancies such as MDS remains investigational MDS treatment historically has been challenging but the US Food and Drug Administration in the past 4 years has approved the hypomethylating agents and decitabine and the immunomodulatory agent lenalidomide for the These approvals highlight recent successes in identifying and targeting pathobiologic abnormalities that contribute to MDS Drugs such as lenalidomide and the analogue from which it was derived thalidomide exert multiple mechanisms of action but partially act via inhibition of angiogenesis Over the next 5 to 10 years preclinical and clinical evaluation of agents with more strictly defined antiangiogenic activity such as inhibitors of vascular endothelial growth factor or agents with partial antiangiogenesis activity such as multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors will ultimately help define the utility of angiogenic blockade in MDS View details for

disorders has been reborn due to a renaissance in uncovering the biologic basis of previously idiopathic cases Unmasking the molecular basis for such cases has in turn led to the development of semimolecular classification schemes for categorizing patients based on recurrent genetic alterations usually related to constitutively activated tyrosine kinases In turn increasing sophistication in unmasking the molecular underpinnings of eosinophilia in patients heretofore classified as idiopathic HES now permits the rationale use biologically targeted therapies such as imatinib mesylate and

IMMUNOLOGY AND ALLERGY CLINICS OF NORTH AMERICA Gotlib J 2006 26 3 Abstract Deregulation of the KIT receptor TK by the prevalent activation loop mutation D816V has served as a focal point in therapeutic strategies aimed curbing neoplastic mast cell growth Perhaps the most important development in this era of targeted therapy and certainly relevant to diseases like mastocytosis is the realization that small molecule inhibitors with varied chemical structure eg PKC412 dasatinib AP23464 can circumvent the resistance of TKs to agents such as imatinib Genuine opportunity now exists to effectively treat mastocytosis and the arsenal consists of several orally bioavailable drugs with promising preclinical activity against D816V and other KIT mutants that promote mast cell growth Because KIT mutations may not act as fully transforming oncogenic events in SM it is prudent to evaluate combinations of TK inhibitors with drugs with activity in mast cell disease such as cladribine and corticosteroids The identification of novel targets within mast cells should aid in the development of complementary therapies that promote enhanced cytotoxicity of mast cells through blockade of nonredundant signaling pathways In addition the generation of murine models that recapitulate human mastocytosis should accelerate preclinical testing of novel agents View details for DOI View details

lack of evidence for a reactive cause of hypereosinophilia or chronic eosinophilic leukemia presence of a clonal cytogenetic abnormality or increased blood or bone marrow blasts resulted in diagnosticians characterizing such nebulous cases as hypereosinophilic syndrome HES However over the last decade significant advances in our understanding of the molecular pathophysiology of eosinophilic disorders have shifted an increasing proportion of cases from this idiopathic HES to genetically defined eosinophilic diseases with recurrent molecular abnormalities The majority of these genetic lesions result in constitutively activated fusion tyrosine kinases the phenotypic consequence of which is an myeloid disorder Most notable among these is the recent discovery of the cryptic gene fusion in karyotypically normal patients with systemic mast cell disease with eosinophilia or idiopathic HES redefining these diseases as clonal eosinophilias Rearrangements involving PDGFRA and PDGFRB in eosinophilic chronic myeloproliferative disorders and of fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 FGFR1 in the 8p11 stem cell myeloproliferative syndrome constitute additional examples of specific genetic alterations linked to clonal eosinophilia The identification of populations of aberrant secreting eosinophilopoietic cytokines such as establish a pathophysiologic basis for cases of

the KIT receptor tyrosine kinase Limited treatment options exist for aggressive systemic mastocytosis ASM and mast cell leukemia MCL We evaluated whether PKC412 a inhibitor of KIT with a different chemical structure from imatinib may have therapeutic use in advanced SM with the D816V KIT mutation We treated a patient with MCL with an associated myelodysplastic syndrome MDS disorder MPD based on in vitro studies demonstrating that PKC412 could inhibit D816V cell growth with a 50 inhibitory concentration IC50 of 30 nM to 40 nM The patient exhibited a partial response with significant resolution of liver function abnormalities In addition PKC412 treatment resulted in a significant decline in the percentage of peripheral blood mast cells and serum histamine level and was associated with a decrease in KIT phosphorylation and D816V KIT mutation frequency The patient died after 3 months of therapy due to progression of her to acute myeloid leukemia AML This case indicates that KIT

with poor survival Low remission rates and high mortality persist as major obstacles particularly in older patients The design of novel agents based on the identification of genetic lesions and aberrant signaling pathways provides opportunity to improve the standard treatment paradigm of intensive cytotoxic chemotherapy Farnesyltransferase inhibitors FTIs show potential to fill this niche The preclinical concept of farnesyltransferase blockade as a targeted therapy against oncogenic Ras has clearly evolved with the recognition that many proteins involved signaling pathways in tumor cells undergo farnesylation Phase trials of FTI monotherapy in AML demonstrate encouraging responses and good tolerability The FTI tipifarnib R115777 Zarnestra Johnson Johnson Titusville NJ has advanced the furthest in clinical trials with the most promising activity in previously untreated AML patients A major emphasis of current clinical studies has been to analyze potential candidate

eosinophilic disorders However over the last 10 years the study of hypereosinophilia has enjoyed a revival This interest has been rekindled by two factors 1 the development of increasingly sophisticated molecular biology techniques that have unmasked recurrent genetic abnormalities linked to eosinophilia and 2 the successful application of targeted therapy with agents such as imatinib to treat eosinophilic diseases To date most of these recurrent molecular abnormalities have resulted in constitutively activated fusion tyrosine kinases whose phenotypic consequence is an myeloid

in PTPN11 were detected in 16 of 49 JMML specimens from patients without NS but they were less common in other myeloid malignancies RAS NF1 and PTPN11 mutations are largely mutually exclusive in JMML which suggests that mutant proteins deregulate myeloid growth through Ras However although cells engineered to express proteins cells showed enhanced growth survival biochemical analysis failed to

with the growing knowledge of the multiple pathobiologic abnormalities in MDS increasing numbers of biospecific agents that target these pathogenetic lesions have entered clinical trial testing Although the term biospecific has been applied to many of these investigational drugs they often exert pleiotropic effects many of which remain to be identified An ongoing challenge will be to more fully characterize the mechanisms of action of these drugs and to characterize biologic correlates of response With these data in hand it will be increasingly feasible to treat patients with
