Kim Lab Website Stanford Diabetes Research Center and Discovery Now Current Research and Scholarly Interests Understanding organ development and achieving functional restoration of diseased organs is a broad goal motivating effort in our group Pancreatic islets of Langerhans endocrine organs that secrete insulin and glucagon have emerged as a paradigm for investigating both organ development and restoration Deficiency of islet or their function underlies the pathogenesis of diabetes mellitus a disease with devastating autoimmune type 1 pandemic type 2 and type 3c forms However islet replacement or preservation in diabetes is ultimately limited by our inadequate understanding of mechanisms controlling islet formation growth and immunological protection To discover these mechanisms my laboratory is using a combination of genetic developmental immunological physiological and genomic approaches in different experimental systems with a focus on several fundamental questions What are the cellular molecular signaling and genetic mechanisms regulating pancreatic development and functional maturation Can we harness our growing understanding of pancreatic islet development to generate replacement islets for diabetes including islet cells generated from human stem cell lines What are the genetic programs underlying diabetes risk What immunological and transplantation paradigms can be developed to protect native or replacement islets in type 1 diabetes Can we advance understanding of normal pancreas development and function to discover the basis of devastating exocrine pancreatic diseases including pancreatic cancer To address these challenges our group has developed new approaches in mice fruit flies pigs primary human pancreatic cells and multipotent human stem cells Each of these systems offers different experimental advantages Discoveries from our systems have created unprecedented opportunities for harnessing knowledge about pancreatic development and growth to restore pancreas islet function and to identify the molecular genetic signaling and immune basis of pancreatic diseases like diabetes mellitus pancreatitis and pancreatic

Developing systems to identify the cell functions regulated by genes linked to type 2 diabetes T2D risk could transform our understanding of the genetic basis of this disease However in vivo systems for efficiently discovering T2D risk gene functions relevant to human cells are currently lacking Here we describe powerful interdisciplinary approaches combining Drosophila genetics and physiology with human islet biology to address this fundamental gap in diabetes research We identify Drosophila orthologs of genes that regulate insulin output With human islets we perform genetic studies and identify cognate human genes that regulate human beta cell function Loss of BCL11A a transcriptional regulator in primary human islet cells leads to enhanced insulin secretion Gene expression profiling reveals regulation of multiple genes involved in insulin exocytosis Thus genetic and physiological systems described here advance the capacity to identify T2D risk gene functions View

therapies for diabetes After birth islet cell growth and function are dynamically regulated however establishing these changes in humans has been challenging Here we describe a multimodal strategy for isolating pancreatic endocrine and exocrine cells from children and adults to identify gene expression and chromatin changes on a genomic scale These profiles revealed distinct proliferative and functional states of islet α cells or β cells and histone modifications underlying gene expression changes Expression of SIX2 and SIX3 transcription factors without prior known functions in the

pancreatic replication in juvenile mice and humans declines with age and elucidating the basis for this decay may reveal strategies for inducing expansion a goal for diabetes therapy Here we show that growth factor receptor Pdgfr signalling controls proliferation in mouse and human pancreatic islets With age declining Pdgfr levels were accompanied by reductions in enhancer of zeste homologue 2 Ezh2 levels and replication Conditional inactivation of the Pdgfra gene in accelerated these changes preventing mouse neonatal expansion and adult regeneration Targeted human activation in mouse stimulated

pancreatic islets adapt to meet physiological challenges and maintain metabolic balance but the mechanisms controlling these facultative responses are unclear Diabetes in patients treated with calcineurin inhibitors such as cyclosporin A indicates that factor of activated NFAT signalling might control adaptive islet responses but the roles of this pathway in in vivo are not understood Here we show that mice with a deletion of the calcineurin phosphatase regulatory subunit calcineurin b1 Cnb1 develop diabetes characterized by decreased proliferation and mass reduced pancreatic insulin content and hypoinsulinaemia Moreover lacking Cnb1 have a reduced expression of established regulators of proliferation Conditional expression of active NFATc1 in rescues these defects and prevents diabetes In normal adult conditional NFAT activation promotes the expression of regulators and increases proliferation and mass resulting in hyperinsulinaemia Conditional NFAT activation also induces the expression of genes critical for endocrine function including all six genes mutated in hereditary forms of monogenic type 2 diabetes Thus signalling regulates multiple factors that control growth

substantial metabolic burden on women through weight gain and insulin resistance Lactation reduces the risk of maternal postpartum diabetes but the mechanisms underlying this benefit are unknown Here we identified beneficial effects of lactation on β cell function which last for years after the cessation of lactation We analyzed metabolic phenotypes including β cell characteristics in lactating and humans and mice Lactating and women showed comparable glucose tolerance at 2 months after delivery but after a mean of years glucose tolerance in lactated women had improved compared to women In humans the disposition index a measure of insulin secretory function of β cells considering the degree of insulin sensitivity was higher in lactated women at years after delivery In mice lactation improved glucose tolerance and increased β cell mass at 3 weeks after delivery Amelioration of glucose tolerance and insulin secretion were maintained up to 4 months after delivery in lactated mice During lactation prolactin induced serotonin production in β cells Secreted serotonin stimulated β cell proliferation through serotonin receptor 2B in an autocrine and paracrine manner In addition intracellular serotonin acted as an antioxidant to mitigate oxidative stress and improved β cell survival Together our results suggest that serotonin mediates the beneficial effects of lactation on female metabolic health by increasing β cell proliferation and reducing oxidative stress in β cells View details for DOI View details for Web of Science ID 000530591800002 View details for PubMedID

Abstract A sufficient mass is crucial for preventing diabetes and perinatal proliferation is important in determining the adult mass However it is not yet known how perinatal proliferation is regulated Here we report that serotonin regulates proliferation through serotonin receptor 2B HTR2B in an manner during the perinatal period In Tph1 knockout Tph1 βKO mice perinatal proliferation was reduced along with the loss of serotonin production in Adult Tph1 βKO mice exhibited glucose intolerance with decreased mass Disruption of Htr2b in also resulted in decreased perinatal proliferation and glucose intolerance in adulthood Growth hormone GH was found to induce serotonin production in through activation of STAT5 during the perinatal period Thus our results indicate that signaling

have emerged as a promising strategy for cancer However it remains unknown if modification of T cell subsets such as Tregs could be useful in other settings such as allograft transplantation Here we use a modular system based on a chimeric antigen receptor CAR that binds covalently modified mAbs to control Treg activation in vivo Transient expression of this CAR mAbCAR in Tregs permitted Treg targeting to specific tissue sites and mitigated allograft responses such as disease mAbCAR Tregs targeted to MHC class I proteins on allografts prolonged islet allograft survival and also prolonged

endocrine organs characteristically dispersed throughout the pancreas During development endocrine progenitors delaminate migrate radially and cluster to form islets Despite the distinctive distribution of islets spatially localized signals that control islet morphogenesis have not been discovered Here we identify a radial signaling axis that instructs developing islet cells to disperse throughout the pancreas A screen of pancreatic extracellular signals identified factors that stimulated islet cell development These included semaphorin 3a a guidance cue in neural development without known functions in the pancreas In the fetal pancreas peripheral mesenchymal cells expressed Sema3a while central nascent islet cells produced the semaphorin receptor neuropilin 2 Nrp2 Nrp2 mutant islet cells developed in proper numbers but had defects in migration and were unresponsive to purified Sema3a Mutant Nrp2 islets aggregated centrally and failed to disperse radially Thus signaling along an unrecognized pancreatic developmental axis constitutes a chemoattractant system essential for generating the hallmark morphogenetic properties of pancreatic islets Unexpectedly and control of

Kim Winslow 2015 29 14 Abstract Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma PDAC is a genomically diverse prevalent and almost invariably fatal malignancy Although conventional genetically engineered mouse models of human PDAC have been instrumental in understanding pancreatic cancer development these models are much too expensive and slow to perform the extensive molecular analyses needed to adequately understand this disease Here we demonstrate that retrograde pancreatic ductal injection of either or vectors allows titratable initiation of pancreatic neoplasias that progress into invasive and metastatic PDAC To enable in vivo gene inactivation in the pancreas we generated a Cas9 allele and lentiviral vectors that express Cre and a RNA targeting of Lkb1 in combination with oncogenic Kras

with the potential for use in both scientific research and clinical therapy Several hESC lines have previously been isolated and characterized however the majority of these lines were generated in the presence of animal serum and feeder cells Therefore the exposure of the hESC to animal products may have induced phenotypic genomic changes in the hESC lines not characteristic of normal hESC Moreover those hESC lines exposed to animal components may not be used for therapeutic applications due to the risk of graft rejection and pathogenic transmission from animal sources In this study we characterized six new hESC lines derived from human blastocysts under component conditions and cultured with human fetal lung fibroblasts The hESC lines retained the ability to are karytopically normal and express embryonic and but not markers of pluripotent hESC In addition we show that telomerase activity decreased in each of the hESC lines following differentiation into embryoid bodies

regulator of organ growth and cell fates and genes encoding factors are expressed in the pancreas However it is unclear whether Wnt signaling regulates pancreatic islet proliferation and differentiation Here we provide evidence that Wnt signaling stimulates islet beta cell proliferation The addition of purified Wnt3a protein to cultured beta cells or islets promoted expression of

expression of activated a crucial Wnt signal transduction protein produced similar phenotypes in vivo leading to beta cell expansion increased insulin production and serum levels and enhanced glucose

including the target genes involved in cardiac physiology are less well studied We focused on the dSUR gene which encodes an cassette transmembrane protein that is expressed in the heart Mammalian SUR genes are associated with K ATP potassium channels which are involved in metabolic homeostasis We provide experimental evidence that Tinman directly regulates dSUR expression in the developing heart We identified a element in the first intron of dSUR which contains Tinman consensus binding sites and is sufficient for faithful dSUR expression in the fly myocardium mutagenesis of this element shows that these Tinman sites are critical to dSUR expression and further genetic manipulations suggest that the GATA transcription factor Pannier is synergistically involved in dSUR expression in vivo Physiological analysis of dSUR flies supports the idea that dSUR plays a protective role against hypoxic stress and heart failure Because dSUR expression dramatically decreases with age it is likely to be a factor involved in the cardiac aging phenotype of Drosophila dSUR provides a model for addressing how embryonic regulators of myocardial cell commitment can contribute to the establishment and

known about how a increase in gene dosage produces the pleiotropic phenotypes of Down syndrome Here we report that two genes DSCR1 and DYRK1A lie within the critical region of human chromosome 21 and act synergistically to prevent nuclear occupancy of NFATc transcription factors which are regulators of vertebrate development We use mathematical modelling to predict that autoregulation within the pathway accentuates the effects of trisomy of DSCR1 and DYRK1A leading to failure to activate NFATc target genes under specific conditions Our observations of mice and mice mouse models of Down syndrome and human trisomy 21 are consistent with these predictions We suggest that the increase in dosage of DSCR1 and DYRK1A cooperatively destabilizes a regulatory circuit leading to reduced NFATc activity and many of the features of Down syndrome More generally these observations suggest that the destabilization of regulatory circuits can underlie human disease View details for DOI View

strategies for treating diseases like diabetes mellitus Previous work has implicated transforming growth signaling as an important regulator of pancreatic islet development but has not established whether this signaling pathway is required for essential islet functions in the adult pancreas Here we describe a conditional system for expressing Smad7 a potent inhibitor of signaling to identify distinct roles for this pathway in adult and embryonic beta cells Smad7 expression in embryonic pancreas cells resulted in striking embryonic beta cell hypoplasia and neonatal lethality Conditional expression of Smad7 in adult cells reduced detectable beta cell expression of MafA menin and other factors that regulate beta cell function Reduced pancreatic insulin content and hypoinsulinemia

Hughes Gu McLean Xiong Meyerson Kim 2005 102 41 Abstract Menin the product of the Men1 gene mutated in familial multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 MEN1 regulates transcription in differentiated cells Menin associates with and modulates the histone methyltransferase activity of a nuclear protein complex to activate gene expression However histone methyltransferase activity in endocrine cells has not been demonstrated and the mechanism of endocrine tumor suppression by menin remains unclear Here we show that histone methylation maintains the in vivo expression of kinase CDK inhibitors to prevent pancreatic islet tumors In vivo expression of CDK inhibitors including p27 and p18 and other cell cycle regulators is disrupted in mouse islet tumors lacking menin Chromatin immunoprecipitation studies reveal that menin directly associates with regions of the p27 and p18 promoters and increases methylation of lysine 4 in histone H3 associated with these promoters Moreover H3 methylation associated with p27 and p18 is reduced in islet tumors from Men1 mutant mice Thus H3 methylation is a crucial function of menin in islet tumor suppression These studies suggest an epigenetic mechanism of tumor suppression by promoting histone modifications menin maintains transcription at multiple loci encoding cell cycle regulators essential for endocrine growth control View

disruption of this balance underlies diabetes pathogenesis cells IPCs in the brain of insects such as Drosophila also regulate serum glucose but it remains unclear whether insulin is the sole hormonal regulator of glucose homeostasis and whether mechanisms of and response in IPCs resemble those in pancreatic islets Here we show by targeted cell ablation that Drosophila corpora cardiaca CC cells of

potassium channels regulating hormone secretion by islets and other mammalian cells They also produce adipokinetic hormone a polypeptide with functions Glucose regulation by CC cells is impaired by

regulated by the interaction of distinct signaling pathways that promote or restrict morphogenesis and cell differentiation Previous work has shown that activin a TGF signaling molecule permits pancreas development by repressing expression of Sonic hedgehog Shh a member of the hedgehog family of signaling molecules that antagonize pancreas development Here we show that Indian hedgehog Ihh another hedgehog family member and Patched 1 Ptc1 a receptor and negative regulator of hedgehog activity are expressed in pancreatic tissue Targeted inactivation of Ihh in mice allows ectopic branching of ventral pancreatic tissue resulting in an annulus that encircles the duodenum a phenotype frequently observed in humans suffering from a rare disorder known as annular pancreas Shh and Shh Ihh mutants have a threefold increase in pancreas mass and a fourfold increase in pancreatic endocrine cell numbers In contrast mutations in Ptc1 reduce pancreas gene expression and impair glucose homeostasis Thus islet cell pancreatic mass and pancreatic morphogenesis are regulated by hedgehog signaling molecules expressed within and adjacent to the embryonic pancreas Defects in hedgehog

endocrine and exocrine structures occurs in regions adjacent to the pancreas including stomach and duodenum and islets in the pancreas are enlarged The homeodomain transcription factor PDX1 required for pancreas development is expressed broadly in the posterior foregut but pancreas development normally initiates only in a restricted region of posterior foregut where endodermal Shh expression is repressed The results suggests that cyclopamine expands the endodermal region where Shh signaling does not occur resulting in pancreatic differentiation in a larger region of foregut endoderm

repress endodermal SHH and thereby permit expression of pancreas genes including Pdx1 and insulin Endoderm treatment with antibodies that block hedgehog activity also results in pancreatic gene

known steps in the development of the pancreas an endodermally derived organ At a developmental stage in chick embryos when the notochord touches the endoderm removal of notochord eliminates subsequent expression of several markers of dorsal pancreas bud development including insulin glucagon and carboxypeptidase Pancreatic gene expression can be initiated and maintained in prepancreatic

first class mglA mutants are nonmotile under all conditions tested The second class csgA mutants are motile but belong to a class of developmental mutants that can not develop alone but will develop when mixed with intact cells Nevertheless both csgA and mglA mutants fail to aggregate properly or to sporulate when induced to form fruiting bodies An mglA mutation and a csgA mutation affect expression of a panel of lacZ fusions to developmental genes in the same way indicating that nonmotile cells and csgA cells arrest development at a similar stage One explanation for the similarity of developmental phenotypes between these mutants is that motility is required for the cell interaction In support of this hypothesis we report that a protein purified from nascent fruiting bodies based on its ability to rescue csgA mutant fruiting body development also rescues sporulation and expression of from developmentally controlled lacZ fusions in mglA strains apparently without restoring their motility levels of active can be purified from mglA cells yet intact mglA cells do not rescue csgA cells upon mixing Intact cells are unable to restore the sporulation and expression of mglA
