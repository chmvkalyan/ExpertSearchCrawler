Fanton Domel Grant Camarillo 2020 Abstract Mild traumatic brain injury mTBI more colloquially known as concussion is common in contact sports such as American football leading to increased scrutiny of head protective gear Standardized laboratory impact testing such as the yearly NFL helmet test is used to rank the protective performance of football helmets motivating new technologies to improve the safety of helmets relative to existing equipment In this work we hypothesized that a helmet which transmits a nearly constant minimum force will result in a reduced risk of mTBI To evaluate the plausibility of this hypothesis we first show that the optimal force transmitted to the head in a reduced order model of the brain is in fact a constant force profile To simulate the effects of a constant force within a helmet we conceptualize a shock absorber system for use within a football helmet We integrate this system within a computational helmet model and simulate its performance on the standard NFL helmet test impact conditions The simulated helmet is compared with other helmet designs with different technologies Computer simulations of head impacts with liquid shock absorption predict that at the highest impact speed the average brain tissue strain is reduced by compared to existing helmet padding when tested on the NFL helmet protocol This study puts forth a target benchmark for the future design of physical manifestations of this technology View details for DOI View details for PubMedID 33210108 Early Effects of Pandemic on Neurosurgical Training in the United

cranial elective spine and emergent cases Programs were surveyed regarding residents perceptions of the impact of on surgical training didactics and research participation Data was analyzed for individual programs and pooled across Across programs the 2019 monthly case average was 211 SD 82 2020 average case volumes for January February March and April were and respectively Compared with 2019 March and April 2020 average cases declined 15 and 49 respectively affected surgical case volume for all programs 75 reported didactics negatively affected and 90 reported resulted in increased research time Several neurosurgery residents have required testing however to our knowledge only one resident from the participating programs tested This study documents a significant reduction in operative volume in 8 neurosurgery residency training programs in early 2020 During this time neurosurgery residents engaged in online didactics and activities reporting increased research productivity Residency programs should collect data to determine the educational impact of the pandemic on resident operative case volumes identify deficiencies and develop plans to mitigate any

8 1 68 Abstract Adamantinomatous craniopharyngioma ACP is a biologically benign but clinically aggressive lesion that has a significant impact on quality of life The incidence of the disease has a bimodal distribution with peaks occurring in children and older adults Our group previously published the results of a transcriptome analysis of pediatric ACPs that identified several genes that were consistently overexpressed relative to other pediatric brain tumors and normal tissue We now present the results of a transcriptome analysis comparing pediatric to adult ACP to identify biological differences between these groups that may provide novel therapeutic insights or support the assertion that potential therapies identified through the study of pediatric ACP may also have a role in adult ACP Using our compiled transcriptome dataset of 27 pediatric and 9 adult ACPs obtained through the Advancing Treatment for Pediatric Craniopharyngioma Consortium we interrogated potential transcriptional differences using several rigorous mathematical analyses These included canonical differential expression analysis divisive agglomerative and probabilistic based hierarchical clustering information theory based characterizations and the deep learning approach HD Spot Our work indicates that there is no therapeutically relevant difference in ACP gene expression based on age

journal of environmental research and public health Vaca Feng Ku Jin Kakusa Ho Zhang Fuller Haglund Grant 2020 17 6 Abstract INTRODUCTION Road traffic injuries RTIs are an important contributor to the morbidity and mortality of developing countries In Uganda motorcycle taxis known as boda bodas are responsible for a growing proportion of RTIs This study seeks to evaluate and comment on traffic safety trends from the past Traffic reports from the Ugandan police force 2009 to 2017 were analyzed for RTI characteristics Furthermore one month of casualty ward data in 2015 and 2018 was collected from the Mulago National Referral Hospital and reviewed for casualty demographics and trauma RTI motorcycle contribution rose steadily from 2009 to 2017 to While the total number of crashes dropped from to between 2010 and 2017 the proportion of fatal RTIs increased from to In the casualty ward RTIs accounted for a greater proportion of patients and traumas in 2018 compared to 2015 10 and 36 respectively Although RTIs have seen a gross reduction in Uganda they have become more deadly with greater motorcycle involvement Hospital data demonstrate a rising need for trauma and neurosurgical care to manage greater RTI patient burden Combining RTI prevention and care pathway improvements may mitigate current RTI trends View details for DOI View details for PubMedID 32235768 Neurosurgical

given its extreme invasiveness and intricate location Glioblastoma multiforme GBM is one of the most common forms of brain cancer andcancer progression is often correlated with significantly altered tissue stiffness To elucidate the effect of matrix stiffness on GBM cell fates previous research is largely limited to 2D studies using immortalized cell lines which has limited physiological relevance The objective of the study is to develop gradient hydrogels with stiffness range as a 3Din vitroGBM model for screening of the effects of matrix stiffness on GBM To increase the physiological relevance tumor xenograft PDTX GBM cells were used Our gradient platform allows formation of hydrogels with stiffness ranging from 40 Pa to 1300 Pa within a few minutes By focusing on a stiffness range this gradient hydrogel platform is designed for investigating brain cancer Increasing stiffness led to decreased GBMproliferation and less spreading which is accompanied bydownregulation of MMPs Using temozolomide TMZ as a model drug we demonstrate that increasing stiffness led to higher drug resistance by PDTX GBM cells in 3D suggesting matrix stiffness can directly modulate how GBM cells respond to drug treatment While the current study focuses on stiffness gradient the set upmay also be adapted for screening othercancer niche cues such as how biochemical ligand

Grant Yang 2020 Abstract Brain tumors exhibit vast genotypic and phenotypic diversity depending on patient age and anatomical location Hydrogels hold great promise as 3D in vitro models for studying brain tumor biology and drug screening yet previous studies were limited to adult glioblastoma cells and most studies used immortalized cell lines Here we report a hydrogel platform that supports the proliferation and invasion of brain tumor cell cultures PDCs isolated from different patient age groups and anatomical locations Hydrogel stiffness was tuned by varying poly concentration Cell adhesive peptide CGRDS hyaluronic acid and crosslinkers were incorporated to facilitate cell adhesion and degradation Three PDC lines were compared including adult glioblastoma cells aGBM pediatric glioblastoma cells pGBM and diffuse pontine intrinsic glioma DIPG A commonly used immortalized adult glioblastoma cell line U87 was included as a control PDCs displayed behavior with 40 Pa hydrogel promoting faster tumor proliferation and invasion Adult GBM cells exhibited faster proliferation than pediatric GBM and DIPG showed slowest proliferation These results suggest both patient age and tumor location affects brain tumor behaviors Adult GBM PDCs also exhibited very different cell proliferation and morphology from U87 The hydrogel reported here can provide a useful tool for future

in 3D remains unclear Here we report a poly hydrogel platform with biochemical cues and tunable stiffness 40 to Pa for 3D culture of glioblastoma xenograft PDTX GBM cells Our results demonstrate that decreasing hydrogel stiffness enhanced PDTX GBM cell proliferation and hydrogels with stiffnesses 240 Pa and below supported robust PDTX GBM cell spreading in 3D PDTX GBM cells encapsulated in hydrogels demonstrated higher drug resistance than 2D control and increasing hydrogel stiffness further enhanced drug resistance Such 3D hydrogel platforms may provide a valuable tool for mechanistic

subdural electrode monitoring SDE remain unclear especially in the pediatric population Our aim was to compare the outcomes of pediatric patients who received intracranial monitoring with SEEG or SDE grids and strips retrospectively studied 38 consecutive pediatric intracranial electrode monitoring cases performed at our institution from 2014 to 2017 history and records were reviewed We also compared direct inpatient hospital costs associated with the two and SDE cohorts both showed high likelihood of identifying epileptogenic zones SEEG SDE Compared with SDE SEEG patients had a significantly shorter operative time versus min P and length of stay versus days P including days spent in the intensive care unit ICU versus days P Stereoelectroencephalography patients tended to

Yousefsani Kondic Grant Zeineh Camarillo B 2020 Abstract Because of the rigid coupling between the upper dentition and the skull instrumented mouthguards have been shown to be a viable way of measuring head impact kinematics for assisting in understanding the underlying biomechanics of concussions This has led various companies and institutions to further develop instrumented mouthguards However their use as a research tool for understanding concussive impacts makes quantification of their accuracy critical especially given the conflicting results from various recent studies Here we present a study that uses a pneumatic impactor to deliver impacts characteristic to football to a Hybrid III headform in order to validate and compare five of the most commonly used instrumented mouthguards We found that all tested mouthguards gave accurate measurements for the peak angular acceleration the peak angular velocity brain injury criteria values mean average errors 13 8 13 respectively and the mouthguards with long enough sampling time windows are suitable for a convolutional neural brain model to calculate the brain strain mean average errors 9 Finally we found that the accuracy of the measurement varies with the impact locations yet is not sensitive to the impact velocity for the most part View details for DOI View details for PubMedID 32989591 Artificial

quantitative measurements of ventricular size over time can facilitate objective comparison automated tools for calculating ventricular volume are not structured for clinical use The authors aimed to develop a fully automated deep learning DL model for pediatric cerebral ventricle segmentation and volume calculation for widespread clinical implementation across multiple study cohort consisted of 200 children with obstructive hydrocephalus from four pediatric hospitals along with 199 controls Manual ventricle segmentation and volume calculation values served as ground truth data An convolutional neural network architecture in which MR images were used as input automatically delineated the ventricles and output volumetric measurements On a test set segmentation accuracy was assessed using the Dice similarity coefficient 0 to 1 and volume calculation was assessed using linear regression Model generalizability was evaluated on an external MRI data set from a fifth hospital The DL model performance was compared against FreeSurfer research segmentation segmentation performed with an overall Dice score of in hydrocephalus in controls The model generalized to external MR images from a fifth pediatric hospital with a Dice score of The model was more accurate than FreeSurfer with faster operating times seconds per scan authors present a DL model for automatic ventricle

giant craniopharyngioma presented with seizures and panhypopituitarism The lesion was initially approached at an outside institution with a transfrontal cyst fenestration but progressive growth occurred later Multiple management options were considered we recommended an endoscopic endonasal approach with the goal of maximal safe resection Virtual reality simulation and printing were employed to evaluate whether the absence of pneumatization of the sinuses and the overall size of the nasal cavity could preclude effective surgical access Our lab results suggested the binostril approach was feasible A wide surgical exposure was performed from planum sphenoidale to clivus and from orbit to orbit After removing the large calcified tumor portion we found an accurate plane of dissection between tumor capsule hypothalami and visual pathways By the end of resection arterial bleeding was encountered secondary to an avulsion of the posterior communicating artery from the posterior cerebral artery An angled aneurysm clip was placed with a applier to secure the site of injury without narrowing the parent artery Immediate and delayed magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography angiography studies showed gross total resection no stroke and no pseudoaneurysm formation On postoperative day 9 patient developed neurological decline and pneumocephalus secondary to necrotic nasoseptal flap Two endonasal repairs with a lateral nasal wall flap were attempted with no success A temporoparietal fascia flap was then harvested and transposed from the temporal to the

ventricular enlargement in hydrocephalus structural changes that underlie microscopic tissue injury might be more difficult to capture diffusion tensor imaging DTI uses properties of water motion to uncover changes in the tissue microenvironment The authors hypothesized that DTI can identify alterations in optic nerve microstructure in children with The authors retrospectively reviewed 21 children 18 years old who underwent DTI before and after neurosurgical intervention for acute obstructive hydrocephalus from posterior fossa tumors Their optic nerve quantitative DTI metrics of mean diffusivity MD and fractional anisotropy FA were compared to those of 21 healthy Patients with hydrocephalus had increased MD and decreased FA in bilateral optic nerves compared to controls p Normalization of bilateral optic nerve MD and FA on median 1 day after neurosurgical intervention was observed as was recovery of MD on median years DTI was used to demonstrate reversible alterations of optic nerve microstructure in children presenting acutely with obstructive hydrocephalus Alterations in optic nerve MD and FA returned to levels on and suggesting that surgical intervention can restore optic nerve tissue microstructure This technique is a safe noninvasive imaging tool that quantifies alterations of neural tissue with a potential role for evaluation of pediatric hydrocephalus

Abstract By their nature tumors pose a set of profound challenges to the immune system with respect to cellular recognition and response coordination Recent research indicates that leukocyte subpopulations especially macrophages TAMs can exert substantial influence on the efficacy of various cancer immunotherapy treatment strategies To better study and understand the roles of TAMs in determining immunotherapeutic outcomes significant technical challenges associated with dynamically monitoring single cells of interest in relevant live animal models of solid tumors must be overcome However imaging techniques with the requisite combination of spatiotemporal resolution contrast and sufficient at increasing depths in tissue are exceedingly limited Here we describe a method to enable longitudinal imaging of TAMs based on optical coherence tomography and spectral scattering from an optimized contrast agent The approach improvements to OCT detection sensitivity and noise reduction enabled observation of individual cells of a specific host lineage in live animals We found that large gold nanorods LGNRs that exhibit a enhanced scattering can selectively label TAMs and activate microglia in an in vivo orthotopic murine model of glioblastoma multiforme We demonstrated near tracking of the migration of cells within these myeloid subpopulations The intrinsic spatiotemporal resolution imaging depth and contrast sensitivity reported herein may facilitate detailed studies of the fundamental behaviors of TAMs and other leukocytes at the level in vivo

controls Using an approach the cerebral white matter cerebral cortex thalamus caudate putamen pallidum hippocampus amygdala nucleus accumbens and brainstem were segmented in each DWI dataset and used to calculate regional volumes and ADC Multivariate analysis of covariance using the regional ADC and volume values as dependent variables and age and gender as covariates revealed a significant

Hayes Steinberg Wintermark 2019 Abstract Blood biomarker tests were recently approved for clinical diagnosis of traumatic brain injury TBI yet there are still fundamental questions which need attention One such question is the stability of putative biomarkers in blood over the course of several days after injury if the sample is unable to be processed into serum or plasma and stored at low temperatures Blood may not be able to be stored at temperatures in austere combat or sports environments In this prospective study of 20 adult patients with positive head computed tomography imaging findings the stability of three biomarkers glial fibrillary acidic protein GFAP ubiquitin and S100B in whole blood and in serum stored at was evaluated over the course of 72 hours after blood collection The amount of time whole blood and serum were refrigerated had no significant effect on GFAP concentration in plasma obtained from whole blood and in serum and respectively concentration in plasma obtained from whole blood and in serum and respectively and S100B concentration in serum Concentration levels of GFAP and S100B in blood collected from patients with TBI were found to be stable at for at least 3 days after blood draw This study suggests that the levels of the three diagnostic markers above are still valid for diagnostic TBI tests if the sample is stored in refrigerated

and modeling in mechanobiology Hernandez Giordano Goubran Parivash Grant Zeineh Camarillo 2019 Abstract Corpus callosum trauma has long been implicated in mild traumatic brain injury mTBI yet the mechanism by which forces penetrate this structure is unknown We investigated the hypothesis that coronal and horizontal rotations produce motion of the falx cerebri that damages the corpus callosum We analyzed previously published head kinematics of 115 sports impacts 2 diagnosed mTBI measured with instrumented mouthguards and used finite element FE simulations to correlate falx displacement with corpus callosum deformation Peak coronal accelerations were larger in impacts with mTBI than those without From FE simulations coronal acceleration was strongly correlated with deep lateral motion of the falx center while horizontal acceleration was correlated with deep lateral motion of the falx periphery r Larger lateral displacement at the falx center and periphery was correlated with higher strains in the corpus callosum body and r respectively The relationship between the corpus callosum and falx was unique removing the falx from the FE model halved peak strains in the corpus callosum from 35 to 17 Consistent with model results we found indications of corpus callosum trauma in diffusion tensor imaging of the mTBI athletes For a measured alteration of consciousness depressed fractional anisotropy and increased mean diffusivity indicated possible damage to the corpus callosum Our results suggest that the corpus callosum may be sensitive to coronal and horizontal rotations because they drive lateral motion of a relatively stiff membrane the falx in the direction of commissural fibers below View details for PubMedID 30859404 Guidelines for the Management of

in 3D hydrogels Biomaterials Wang Li Sinha Peterson Grant Yang 2019 202 Abstract Glioblastoma GBM is an aggressive malignant brain tumor with median survival of 12 months and survival rate less than 5 GBM is highly vascularized and the interactions between tumor and endothelial cells play an important role in driving tumor growth To study interactions the gold standard model is transwell culture which fails to recapitulate the biochemical or physical cues found in tumor niche Recently we reported the development of poly hydrogels as 3D niche that supported GBM proliferation and invasion To further mimic the microanatomical architecture of interactions in vivo here we developed a model that mimics the spatial organization of tumor and endothelial cells To increase the physiological relevance GBM cells and mouse brain endothelial cells were used as model cell types Using alginate fibers as porogens endothelial cells were deployed and patterned into structures in 3D hydrogels with high cell viability and retention of endothelial phenotype led to a significant increase in GBM cell proliferation and decrease in endothelial cell expression of cell adhesion proteins In summary we have developed a novel 3D model that mimics the in vivo spatial organization of brain tumor and endothelial cells Such model may provide a valuable tool for future mechanistic studies to elucidate the effects of interactions on tumor progression in a more manner View details for PubMedID 30836243 Commentary Limited Dorsal Myeloschisis Reconsideration of its Embryological Origin Neurosurgery Quon

GBM is a highly aggressive malignant brain tumor with fatal outcome macrophages and microglia TAMs have been found to be major immune cells in the tumor microenvironment Hence modulation and reeducation of macrophages and microglia in GBM is considered a promising antitumor strategy Resident microglia and invading macrophages have been shown to have distinct origin and function Whereas yolk microglia reside in the brain monocytes invade the central nervous system only under pathological conditions like tumor formation We recently showed that disruption of the signaling axis is efficacious against various brain tumors including GBM primarily by inducing tumor phagocytosis However most effects are attributed to macrophages recruited from the periphery but the role of the brain resident microglia is unknown Here we sought to utilize a model to distinguish resident microglia and peripheral macrophages within the pool using orthotopically xenografted immunodeficient and syngeneic mouse models with genetically macrophages Ccr2 RFP and microglia Cx3cr1 GFP We show that even in the absence of phagocytizing macrophages Ccr2 microglia are effector cells of tumor cell phagocytosis in response to blockade Additionally macrophages and microglia show distinct morphological and transcriptional changes Importantly the transcriptional profile of microglia shows less of an inflammatory response which makes them a promising target for clinical applications View details for PubMedID 30602457 versus manual navigated stereoelectroencephalography in adult epilepsy

types of epilepsy surgery performed consisted of implantation of responsive neurostimulation RNS device 56 resection and laser ablation for navigated SEEG For SEEG either RNS implantation or laser ablation were performed or offered A majority of navigated and patients who underwent epilepsy surgery achieved either Engel Class I navigated or II navigated outcome with no significant difference

instrumented mouthguards in professional MMA fighters MMA fighters were examined for a baseline and again within 120 h fight whereas rugby players were examined and again or in a subset of cases serological analysis of BBB biomarkers and an analysis of instrumented mouthguard data was performed Here we provide pilot data that demonstrate disruption of the BBB in both professional MMA fighters

malignant phenotype and high mortality in patients In order to better understand the signaling pathways underlying glioblastoma invasion we performed the first loss of function screen specifically designed to identify genes that facilitate cell invasion We tested genes predicted to be involved in trafficking and motility Using a transwell invasion assay we discovered 33 genes essential for invasion Of the 11 genes we selected for secondary testing using a wound healing assay 6 demonstrated a significant decrease in migration The strongest regulator of invasion was protein kinase 4 MAP4K4 Targeting of MAP4K4 with single guide RNAs or a MAP4K4 inhibitor reduced migration and invasion in vitro This effect was consistent across three additional patient derived glioblastoma cell lines Analysis of transition markers in U138 cells with lack or inhibition of MAP4K4 demonstrated protein expression consistent with a state Importantly MAP4K4 inhibition limited migration in a subset

Abstract Topical vancomycin has been demonstrated to be safe and effective for reducing surgical site infections SSIs following spine surgery in both adults and children however there are no studies of its efficacy in reducing SSIs in craniofacial surgery The SSIs are one of the most common complications following craniofacial surgery The complexity of craniofacial procedures use of grafts and implants long operative durations and larger surgical wounds all contribute to the heightened risk of SSIs in pediatric craniofacial cases A retrospective review of all open and endoscopic pediatric craniofacial procedures performed between May 2014 and December 2017 at a single children hospital was conducted to examine SSI rates between patients receiving topical vancomycin and a historical control group The treatment group received topical vancomycin irrigation before wound closure An cost analysis was performed to determine the associated with topical vancomycin use A total of 132 craniofacial procedures were performed during the study period with 50 cases in the control group and 82 cases in the vancomycin group Overall SSI rate was Use of topical vancomycin irrigation led to a significant reduction in SSIs SSI or in control group vs or 0 in vancomycin group P No adverse events were observed with topical vancomycin use The potential associated with the use of topical

posterior fossa tumors in children The pathophysiology of PFS remains incompletely elucidated however the symptoms of PFS suggest the possibility of widespread cortical dysfunction In this study the authors utilized arterial spin labeling ASL an MR perfusion modality that provides quantitative measurements of cerebral blood flow without the use of intravenous contrast to assess cortical blood flow in patients with database of medulloblastoma treated at the authors institution from 2004 to 2016 was retrospectively reviewed and 14 patients with PFS were identified Immediate postoperative ASL for patients with PFS and medulloblastoma patients who did not develop PFS were compared Additionally in patients with PFS ASL following the return of speech was compared with immediate postoperative immediate postoperative ASL patients who subsequently developed PFS had statistically significant decreases in right frontal lobe perfusion and a trend toward decreased perfusion in the left frontal lobe compared with controls Patients with PFS had statistically significant increases in bilateral frontal lobe perfusion after the resolution of symptoms compared with their immediate postoperative imaging perfusion imaging identifies decreased frontal lobe blood flow as a strong physiological correlate of PFS that is consistent with the symptomatology of PFS This is the first study to demonstrate that decreases in frontal lobe perfusion are present in the immediate postoperative period and resolve with the resolution of symptoms suggesting a physiological explanation for the transient symptoms of PFS View details for DOI View details for PubMedID 31374541 Longitudinal changes in hippocampal subfield volume associated with collegiate football Journal of neurotrauma

Abstract Collegiate football athletes are subject to repeated head impacts that may cause brain injury The hippocampus is composed of several distinct subfields with possible differential susceptibility to injury The purpose of this study is to determine whether there are longitudinal changes in hippocampal subfield volume in collegiate football A prospective cohort study was conducted over a period tracking 63 football and 34 volleyball male collegiate athletes Athletes underwent structural magnetic resonance imaging and automated segmentation provided hippocampal subfield volumes At baseline football athletes demonstrated a smaller subiculum volume than volleyball athletes mm3 A regression analysis performed within football athletes similarly demonstrated a smaller subiculum volume among those at increased concussion risk based on athlete position For the longitudinal analysis a linear model assessed the interaction between sport and time revealing a significant decrease in CA1 volume in football athletes without an concussion compared to volleyball athletes volume difference per mm3 This decrease in CA1 volume over time was significant when football athletes were examined in isolation from volleyball athletes Thus this prospective longitudinal study showed a decrease in CA1 volume over time in football athletes in addition to baseline differences that were identified in the downstream subiculum Hippocampal changes may have important implications for sports View details for PubMedID 31044639 LEVERAGING AGGREGATE DATA AT THE POINT OF CARE REDUCES

Abstract To determine resection margins near eloquent tissue electrical cortical stimulation ECS mapping is often used with visual naming tasks In recent years auditory naming tasks have been found to provide a more comprehensive map Differences in language sites have been found in adult patients but there is a paucity of research on ECS language studies in pediatric patients The goals of this study were to evaluate distinctions between visual and auditory modalities and identify which cortical subregions most often contain critical language function in a pediatric pediatric patients with epilepsy or temporal lobe pathology underwent ECS mapping using visual n 21 and auditory n 14 tasks Fisher exact test was used to determine whether the frequency of errors in the stimulated trials was greater than the patient baseline error rate for each tested modality and the medial superior temporal gyrus was a common language site for both visual and auditory language and of patients respectively other subregions showed significant differences between modalities and there was significant variability between patients Visual language was more likely to be located in the anterior temporal lobe than was auditory language The pediatric patients exhibited fewer parietal language sites and a larger range of sites overall than did adult patients in previously published was no single area critical for language in more than 50 of patients tested in either modality for which more than 1 patient was tested n 1 affirming that language function is plastic in the setting of pathology The high rates of language function throughout the left frontal temporal and anterior parietal regions with few areas of overlap between modalities suggest that ECS mapping with both visual and auditory testing is necessary to obtain a comprehensive language map prior to epileptic focus or tumor resection View details for DOI View details for PubMedID 31703207 Transnasal endoscopic

Ruan Barbat Camarillo B 2019 Abstract Given the worldwide adverse impact of traumatic brain injury TBI on the human population its diagnosis and prediction are of utmost importance Historically many studies have focused on associating head kinematics to brain injury risk Recently there has been a push towards using computationally expensive finite element FE models of the brain to create tissue deformation metrics of brain injury Here we develop a new brain injury metric the Brain Angle Metric BAM based on the dynamics of a 3 lumped parameter brain model The brain model is built based on the measured natural frequencies of an FE brain model simulated with live human impact data We show it can be used to rapidly estimate peak brain strains experienced during head rotational accelerations that cause mild TBI On our dataset the simplified model correlates with peak principal FE strain Further coronal and axial brain model displacement correlated with peak strain in the corpus callosum Our proposed injury metric BAM uses the maximum angle predicted by our brain model and is compared against a number of existing rotational and translational kinematic injury metrics on a dataset of head kinematics from 27 clinically diagnosed injuries and 887 We found that BAM performed comparably to peak angular acceleration translational acceleration and angular velocity in classifying injury and events Metrics which separated time traces into their directional components had improved model deviance to those which combined components into a single time trace magnitude Our brain model can be used in future work to rapidly approximate the peak strain resulting from mild to moderate head impacts and to quickly assess brain injury risk View details for DOI View details for PubMedID

infections and cerebrospinal fluid CSF leaks With little empirical evidence to guide management there is variability in the interventions undertaken to limit complications best practices may improve the care of patients undergoing cTSC surgery Here authors conducted a study to identify best Delphi method was employed to identify consensual best practices A literature review regarding cTSC surgery together with a survey of current practices was distributed to 17 pediatric neurosurgeons Thirty statements were then formulated and distributed to the group Results of the second survey were discussed during an meeting leading to further consensus which was defined as 80 agreement on a Likert scale strongly agree agree disagree strongly disagree best practices were identified with all participants willing to incorporate them into their practice There were four preoperative interventions 1 2 asymptomatic AND symptomatic patients should be referred to urology preoperatively 3 4 routine preoperative urine cultures are not necessary for asymptomatic AND symptomatic patients There were nine intraoperative interventions 5 patients should receive perioperative cefazolin or an equivalent alternative in the event of allergy 6 skin preparation is the preferred regimen 7 saline irrigation should be used intermittently throughout the case 8 irrigation should be used following dural closure 9 a nonlocking running suture technique should be used for dural closure 10 dural graft overlay should be used when unable to obtain primary dural closure 11 an expansile dural graft should be incorporated in cases of lipomyelomeningocele in which primary dural closure does not permit free flow of CSF 12 paraxial muscles should be closed as a layer separate from the fascia 13 routine placement of postoperative drains is not necessary There were three postoperative interventions 14 postoperative antibiotics are an option and if given should be discontinued within 24 hours 15 patients should remain flat for at least 24 hours postoperatively 16 routine use of abdominal binders or other compressive devices postoperatively is not necessary One intervention was prioritized

Nikas Vassilyadi Muh Wetjen Lam 2018 22 3 Abstract OBJECTIVE In children the repair of skull defects arising from decompressive craniectomy presents a unique set of challenges studies have identified different risk factors for the common complications of cranioplasty resorption and infection The goal of the present study was to determine the risk factors for bone resorption and infection after pediatric cranioplasty METHODS The authors conducted a multicenter retrospective case study that included all patients who underwent cranioplasty to correct a skull defect arising from a decompressive craniectomy at 13 centers between 2000 and 2011 and were less than 19 years old at the time of cranioplasty Prior systematic review of the literature along with expert opinion guided the selection of variables to be collected These included indication for craniectomy history of abusive head trauma method of bone storage method of bone fixation use of drains size of bone graft presence of other implants including ventriculoperitoneal VP shunt presence of fluid collections age at craniectomy and time between craniectomy and cranioplasty RESULTS A total of 359 patients met the inclusion criteria The patients mean age was years and were female cases were complicated by infection In multivariate analysis presence of a cranial implant primarily VP shunt OR 95 CI presence of gastrostomy OR 95 CI and ventilator dependence OR 95 CI were significant risk factors for cranioplasty infection No other variable was associated with infection Of the 240 patients who underwent a cranioplasty with bone graft showed bone resorption significant enough to warrant repeat surgical intervention The most important predictor of cranioplasty bone resorption was age at the time of cranioplasty For every month of increased age the risk of bone flap resorption decreased by 1 OR 95 CI p Other risk factors for resorption in multivariate models were the use of external ventricular drains and lumbar shunts CONCLUSIONS This is the largest study of pediatric cranioplasty outcomes performed to date Analysis included variables found to be significant in previous retrospective reports Presence of a cranial implant such as VP shunt is the most significant risk factor for cranioplasty infection whereas younger age at cranioplasty is the dominant risk factor for bone resorption View details for

Pediatrics Ho Muftuoglu Pendharkar Sussman Porter Halpern Grant A 2018 Abstract OBJECTIVE Stereoelectroencephalography SEEG has increased in popularity for localization of epileptogenic zones in epilepsy because safety accuracy and efficacy have been well established in both adult and pediatric populations Development of technology has greatly enhanced the efficiency of this procedure without sacrificing safety or precision To date there have been very limited reports of the use of this new technology in children The authors present their initial experience using the ROSA platform for SEEG in a pediatric population METHODS Between February 2016 and October 2017 20 consecutive patients underwent SEEG with the ROSA robotic guidance platform as part of ongoing seizure localization and workup for medically refractory epilepsy of several different etiologies Medical and surgical history imaging and trajectory plans as well as operative records were analyzed retrospectively for surgical accuracy efficiency safety and epilepsy outcomes RESULTS A total of 222 leads were placed in 20 patients with an average of leads per patient The mean total case time SD was minutes and the mean operating time per lead was with improvements in total vs and operative vs case over the course of the study The mean radial error was mm Clinically useful data were obtained from SEEG in 95 of cases and epilepsy surgery was indicated and performed in 95 of patients In patients who underwent definitive epilepsy surgery with at least a 50 achieved an Engel class I result seizure freedom There were no postoperative complications associated with SEEG placement and monitoring CONCLUSIONS In this study the authors demonstrate that rapid adoption of SEEG is possible even at a institution with minimal learning curve Use of robot guidance for SEEG can lead to significantly decreased operating times while maintaining safety the overall goals of identification of epileptogenic zones and

Abstract OBJECTIVE Fast magnetic resonance imaging fsMRI sequences are spin echo images with fast acquisition times that have replaced CT scans for many conditions Introduced as a means of evaluating children with hydrocephalus and macrocephaly these sequences reduce the need for anesthesia and can be more especially for children who require multiple surveillance scans However the role of fsMRI has yet to be investigated in evaluating the posterior fossa in patients with Chiari I abnormality The goal of this study was to examine the diagnostic performance of fsMRI in evaluating the cerebellar tonsils in comparison to conventional MRI METHODS The authors performed a retrospective analysis of 18 pediatric patients with a confirmed diagnosis of based on conventional brain MRI and 30 controls without who had presented with various neurosurgical conditions The patients were included if fsMRI studies had been obtained within 1 year of conventional MRI with no surgical intervention between the studies Two neuroradiologists reviewed the studies in a blinded fashion to determine the diagnostic performance of fsMRI in detecting For the cohort the fsMRI and MRI exams were randomized and the blinded reviewers performed tonsillar measurements on both scans RESULTS The mean age of the cohort was years and 50 of these subjects were male The mean time interval between fsMRI and conventional MRI was days percent of the subjects had undergone imaging after posterior fossa decompression The sensitivity and specificity of fsMRI in detecting was 100 95 CI and 95 CI respectively If only preoperative patients are considered both sensitivity and specificity increase to 100 The authors also performed a cost analysis and determined that fsMRI was significantly compared to MRI or CT CONCLUSIONS Despite known limitations fsMRI may serve as a useful diagnostic and surveillance tool for It is more than full conventional brain MRI and decreases the need for

mTBIs are often associated with posttraumatic stress disorder PTSD In cases of chronic mTBI accurate diagnosis can be challenging due to the overlapping symptoms this condition shares with PTSD Furthermore mTBIs are heterogeneous and not easily observed using conventional neuroimaging tools despite the fact that diffuse axonal injuries are the most common injury Diffusion tensor imaging DTI is sensitive to diffuse axonal injuries and is thus more likely to detect mTBIs especially when analyses account for the variability of these injuries Using a approach we compared fractional anisotropy FA abnormalities between groups with a history of mTBI n 35 comorbid mTBI and PTSD mTBI PTSD n 22 and healthy controls n 37 We compared all three groups on the number of abnormal FA clusters derived from injury profiles individual maps along a common white matter skeleton The mTBI PTSD group evinced a greater number of abnormally low FA clusters relative to both the healthy controls and the mTBI group without PTSD p Across the groups with a history of mTBI increased numbers of abnormally low FA clusters were significantly associated with PTSD symptom severity depression symptoms and reduced information processing speed p These findings highlight the utility of microstructural analyses when searching for brain abnormalities particularly in patients with PTSD This

Microglia the brain resident macrophages are dynamic CNS custodians with surprising origins in the yolk sac The consequences of their distinct ontogeny are unknown but critical to understanding and treating brain diseases We created a brain macrophage transplantation system to disentangle how environment and ontogeny specify microglial identity We find that donor cells extensively engraft in the CNS of mice and even after exposure to a cell culture environment microglia fully regain their identity when returned to the CNS Though transplanted macrophages from multiple tissues can express microglial genes in the brain only those of origin fully attain microglial identity Transplanted macrophages of inappropriate origin including primary human cells in a humanized host express genes and specific ontogeny markers Through brain macrophage transplantation we discover new principles of microglial identity that have broad applications to the study of disease and development of myeloid

MRgLITT is a minimally invasive method for thermal destruction of benign or malignant tissue that has been used for selective amygdalohippocampal ablation for the treatment of temporal lobe epilepsy The authors report their initial experience adopting a stereotactic platform that allows for completion of the entire procedure in the MRI suite METHODS Between October 2014 and May 2016 17 patients with mesial temporal sclerosis were selected by a multidisciplinary epilepsy board to undergo a selective amygdalohippocampal ablation for temporal lobe epilepsy using MRgLITT The first 9 patients underwent standard laser ablation in 2 phases operating room OR and MRI suite whereas the next 8 patients underwent laser ablation entirely in the MRI suite with the ClearPoint platform A checklist specific to the laser amydalohippocampal ablation was developed and used for each case For both cohorts clinical and operative information including average case times and accuracy data was collected and analyzed RESULTS There was a learning curve associated with using this system However operative times decreased in a linear fashion as did total anesthesia time In fact the total mean patient procedure time was less in the MRI cohort minutes than in the OR cohort minutes The mean anesthesia time was significantly shorter in the MRI cohort minutes than in the OR cohort minutes p CONCLUSIONS The MRI platform for MRgLITT can be adopted in an expedient manner Completion of MRgLITT entirely in the MRI suite may lead to significant advantages in procedural times View details for PubMedID

data acquired on different scanners varies significantly in its content throughout the brain even if the acquisition parameters are nearly identical Thus proper harmonization of such data sets is necessary to increase the sample size and thereby the statistical power of neuroimaging studies In this paper we present a novel approach to harmonize dMRI data the raw signal instead of dMRI derived measures such as fractional anisotropy using rotation invariant spherical harmonic RISH features embedded within a image registration framework All dMRI data sets from all sites are registered to a common template and differences in RISH features between sites at a group level are used to harmonize the signal in a manner We validate our method on diffusion data acquired from seven different sites two GE three Philips and two Siemens scanners on a group of healthy subjects We demonstrate the efficacy of our method by statistically comparing diffusion measures such as fractional anisotropy mean diffusivity and generalized fractional anisotropy across these sites before and after data harmonization Validation was also done on a group oftest subjects which were not used to learn the

and neurostimulator placement represent an evolution in staged surgical intervention for epilepsy As this practice evolves optimal targeting will require standardized outcome measures that compare electrode lead or laser source with postprocedural changes in seizure frequency The authors propose and present a novel stereotactic coordinate system based on mesial temporal anatomical landmarks to facilitate the planning and delineation of outcomes based on extent of ablation or region of stimulation within mesial temporal structures METHODS The body of the hippocampus contains a natural axis approximated by the interface of cornu ammonis area 4 and the dentate gyrus The uncal recess of the lateral ventricle acts as a landmark to characterize the extent of this axis Several volumetric rotations are quantified for alignment with the mesial temporal coordinate system First the brain volume is rotated to align with standard anterior commissure space Then it is rotated through the axial and sagittal angles that the hippocampal axis makes with the line RESULTS Using this coordinate system customized MATLAB software was developed to allow for intuitive standardization of targeting and interpretation The angle between the line and the hippocampal axis was found to be approximately when viewed sagittally and approximately when viewed axially Implanted electrodes can then be identified from CT in this space and laser tip position and burn geometry can be calculated based on the intraoperative and postoperative MRI CONCLUSIONS With the advent of stereotactic surgery for mesial temporal targets a mesial temporal stereotactic system is introduced that may facilitate operative planning improve surgical outcomes and standardize outcome assessment View details

Choudhri Dodd Vasanawala Alley Moseley Holdsworth Grant Cheshier Yeom 2018 Abstract OBJECTIVE Patients with brain arteriovenous malformations AVMs often require repeat imaging with MRI or MR angiography MRA CT angiography CTA and digital subtraction angiography DSA The ideal imaging modality provides excellent vascular visualization without incurring added risks such as radiation exposure The purpose of this study is to evaluate the performance of MRA using a 3D volumetric sequence for visualizing and grading pediatric brain AVMs in comparison with CTA and DSA which is the current imaging gold standard METHODS In this retrospective cohort study 21 patients with AVMs evaluated by CTA and DSA between April 2014 and August 2017 were included Two experienced raters graded AVMs using criteria on all imaging studies Lesion conspicuity LC and diagnostic confidence DC were assessed using a Likert scale and interrater agreement was determined The test was performed to assess the raters grades and scores of LC and DC with subsequent post hoc pairwise comparisons to assess for statistically significant differences between pairs of groups at p RESULTS Assigned grades for AVMs on DSA and CTA were not significantly different p LC and DC scores were higher with than with CTA p A significant difference in LC scores was found between CTA and p and CTA and DSA p but not between and DSA p A significant difference in DC scores was found among DSA and CTA p and between all pairs of the groups p Interrater agreement was good to very good for all image groups κ p CONCLUSIONS performed robustly in the diagnostic evaluation of brain AVMs with improved visual depiction of AVMs compared with CTA and comparable grading relative to CTA and DSA View details for PubMedID 29882734 Surgical outcomes of pediatric spinal cord astrocytomas systematic review and Journal of neurosurgery Pediatrics Azad Pendharkar Pan Huang Li Esparza Mehta Connolly Veeravagu Campen Cheshier Edwards Fisher Grant A 2018 Abstract OBJECTIVE Pediatric spinal astrocytomas are rare spinal lesions that pose unique management challenges Therapeutic options include resection GTR subtotal resection STR and adjuvant chemotherapy or radiation therapy With no randomized controlled trials the optimal management approach for children with spinal astrocytomas remains unclear The aim of this study was to conduct a systematic review and on pediatric spinal astrocytomas METHODS The authors performed a systematic review of the electronic database to investigate the impact of histological grade and extent of resection on overall survival among patients with spinal cord astrocytomas They retained publications in which the majority of reported cases included astrocytoma histology RESULTS previously published studies met the eligibility criteria totaling 578 patients with spinal cord astrocytomas The spinal level of intramedullary spinal cord tumors was predominantly cervical followed by thoracic Overall resection was more common than biopsy and GTR was slightly more commonly achieved than STR vs The reported rates of GTR and STR rose markedly from 1984 to 2015 Patients with astrocytomas had markedly worse overall survival than patients with tumors Patients receiving GTR may have better overall survival than those receiving STR CONCLUSIONS The authors describe trends in the management of pediatric spinal cord astrocytomas and suggest a benefit of GTR over STR for overall survival View details for PubMedID 30028275 outcomes of primarily metastatic juvenile pilocytic astrocytoma in

all cases of JPA Due to the rarity of primarily metastatic JPA there is currently no standard treatment paradigm and the outcomes are not fully known The goal of this case series was to add to the current understanding of this disease process METHODS The authors searched a comprehensive database of pediatric patients with brain and spinal cord tumors treated at Lucile Packard Children Hospital from 1997 to 2016 and identified 5 patients with primarily metastatic JPA A retrospective chart review was performed and details of the patients treatment and clinical course were recorded for further analysis RESULTS For the 5 patients with primarily metastatic JPA the mean period was years All patients in our series had biopsies or subtotal resections and upfront treatment Three patients were treated with chemotherapy alone one was treated with chemotherapy and radiotherapy and one was treated with radiotherapy alone Four patients had stable disease after initial treatment and one patient had multiple episodes of progressive disease but underwent successful salvage therapy and has had stable disease for 19 years One patient died of an intracerebral hemorrhage 10 years following initial radiation treatment believed to be secondary to radiation vasculopathy CONCLUSIONS Evaluation of the entire neuraxis should be performed in all instances of initial JPA diagnosis to properly assess for primarily metastatic disease Many patients with primarily metastatic JPA will have stable disease after upfront treatment although the higher rate of stable disease found in this series relative to other reports is likely secondary to the small sample size View details for PubMedID 29125440 Intraoperative Imaging Modalities and the Potential Role of Speckle Modulating Optical Coherence

reduce cost and complications associated with surgical site infections SSIs Topical vancomycin has been an effective tool for reducing SSIs following routine neurosurgical procedures in the spine and following adult craniotomies However widespread adoption within the pediatric neurosurgical community has not yet occurred and there are no studies to report on the safety and efficacy of this intervention The authors present the first study of topical vancomycin following open craniotomy in the pediatric population METHODS In this retrospective study the authors reviewed all open craniotomies performed over a period from to for topical vancomycin use SSIs and clinical variables associated with SSI Topical vancomycin was utilized as an infection prophylaxis and was applied as a liquid solution following replacement of a bone flap or after dural closure when no bone flap was reapplied RESULTS Overall 466 consecutive open craniotomies were completed between and of which 43 utilized topical vancomycin There was a SSI rate in the nontopical cohort versus 0 in the topical vancomycin cohort p The number needed to treat was 66 There were no significant differences in risk factors for SSI between cohorts There were no complications associated with topical vancomycin use CONCLUSIONS Routine topical vancomycin administration during closure of open craniotomies can be a safe and effective tool for reducing SSIs in the pediatric neurosurgical population View details for PubMedID 30141749 outcomes of primarily metastatic juvenile pilocytic astrocytoma in children

leading cause of traumatic brain injury Most of the current bike helmets are made of expanded polystyrene EPS foam and ultimately designed to prevent blunt trauma skull fracture However these helmets have limited effectiveness in preventing brain injuries With the availability of systems sensors and high energy density batteries a new class of helmets expandable helmets can sense an impending collision and expand to protect the head By allowing softer liner medium and larger helmet sizes this novel approach in helmet design provides the opportunity to achieve much lower acceleration levels during collision and may reduce the risk of brain injury In this study we first develop theoretical frameworks to investigate impact dynamics of current EPS helmets and airbag a form of expandable helmet design We compared our theoretical models with anthropomorphic test dummy drop test experiments Peak accelerations obtained from these experiments with airbag helmets achieve up to an reduction in the risk of concussion compared to standard EPS helmets Furthermore we construct an optimization framework for airbag helmets to minimize concussion and severe head injury risks at different impact velocities while avoiding excessive deformation and An optimized airbag helmet with m thickness at 72 8 kPa reduces the head injury criterion HIC value to 190 25 at head impact velocity compared to a HIC of 1300 with a standard EPS helmet Based on a correlation with previously reported HIC values in the literature this airbag helmet design substantially reduces the risks of severe head injury up

overrepresentation of the alleles inherited from the mother on Chromosome 16 in brain tissue DNA only indicative of somatic uniparental disomy UPD of the of Chromosome 16 Using methylation analyses an imprinted locus on 16p spanning ZNF597 was identified which results in increased expression of ZNF597 mRNA and protein in the brain tissue of the second case Enhanced mTOR signaling was observed in tissue specimens from both patients We speculate that overexpression of maternally expressed ZNF597 led to aberrant hemispheric development in the patient with somatic UPD of Chromosome 16p possibly through modulation of mTOR signaling View details for PubMedID 28864461 View details for PubMedCentralID PMC5593155 Diagnostic Utility of Intraoperative Neurophysiological Monitoring for

was to systematically evaluate the diagnostic utility of intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring IONM for detecting postoperative injury in resection of intramedullary spinal cord tumors IMSCT management of IMSCT can involve key neurological and vascular structures IONM aims to assess the functional integrity of susceptible elements in real time The diagnostic value of IONM for ISMCT has not been systematically performed a systematic review of the PubMed and MEDLINE databases for studies investigating the use of IONM for IMSCT and conducted a of diagnostic search produced 257 citations After application of exclusion criteria 21 studies remained 10 American Academy of Neurology grade III and 11 American Academy of Neurology grade IV We found that a strong pooled mean sensitivity of 90 95 confidence interval CI and a weaker pooled mean specificity of 82 95 CI for potential MEP recording changes potential SSEP recording changes yielded pooled sensitivity of 85 95 CI and pooled specificity of 72 95 CI The pooled diagnostic odds ratio for MEP was 95 CI and 95 CI for SSEP Bivariate analysis yielded summary receiver operative characteristic curves with area under the curve of for MEPs and for and SSEPs appear to be more sensitive than specific for detection of postoperative injury Patients with perioperative neurological deficits are 56 times more likely to have had changes in MEPs during the procedure We observed considerable variability in alarm criteria and interventions in response to IONM changes indicating the need for prospective studies capable of

OF AMERICA Jiang Fitch Wang Wilson Li Grant Yang 2016 113 48 Abstract Glioblastoma multiforme GBM is one of the most intractable of human cancers principally because of the highly infiltrative nature of these neoplasms Tracking and eradicating infiltrating GBM cells and tumor microsatellites is of utmost importance for the treatment of this devastating disease yet effective strategies remain elusive Here we report polymeric human stem cells hADSCs overexpressing tumor necrosis ligand TRAIL as vehicles for targeting and eradicating GBM cells in vivo Our results showed that polymeric transfection led to robust of TRAIL in hADSCs and that hADSCs induced apoptosis When transplanted in a mouse intracranial xenograft model of glioblastoma cells hADSCs exhibited directional migration and infiltration toward GBM tumor Importantly hADSCs inhibited GBM growth extended survival and reduced the occurrence of microsatellites Repetitive injection of hADSCs significantly prolonged animal survival compared with single injection of these cells Taken together our data suggest that hADSCs exhibit the therapeutically relevant behavior of tumortropic migration and could be a promising

Pediatric surgical trials are rare and the impact of such trials on the institutions in which they are conducted is unknown The purpose of this study was to analyze the clinical and financial impact of The trial a Phase I clinical trial requiring the biopsy or resection of recurrent medulloblastoma or PNET for enrollment Inpatient financial and clinical volume information was collected during the 3 years of trial enrollment and the years preceding and following it The primary endpoints were the difference in direct contribution margin DCM or net gain of study and patients and the difference in surgical volume during the study and periods The trial enrolled 18 patients 15 had surgery at the sponsor institution and three had surgery at their home institution then transferred tumor material to the sponsor institution There were no differences between the two groups for potentially confounding variables such as neurosurgical procedure work relative value units P or insurance provider P There was no difference between the inpatient DCM per case for the institution for patients mean SD 9039 and study patients P During the period there were a mean of pediatric brain tumor resections per month compared to cases per month during the study period a 17 increase When the 15 study patients were excluded there were cases per month a 7 increase However this increase in total case volume including study and patients was not significant P Phase I clinical trials may increase institutional surgical volume without imposing a financial burden Finances are unlikely to be a barrier for

Camarillo B 2016 Abstract Bicycling is the leading cause of traumatic brain injury Most of the current bike helmets are made of expanded polystyrene EPS foam and ultimately designed to prevent blunt trauma skull fracture However these helmets have limited effectiveness in preventing brain injuries With the availability of systems sensors and high energy density batteries a new class of helmets expandable helmets can sense an impending collision and expand to protect the head By allowing softer liner medium and larger helmet sizes this novel approach in helmet design provides the opportunity to achieve much lower acceleration levels during collision and may reduce the risk of brain injury In this study we first develop theoretical frameworks to investigate impact dynamics of current EPS helmets and airbag a form of expandable helmet design We compared our theoretical models with anthropomorphic test dummy drop test experiments Peak accelerations obtained from these experiments with airbag helmets achieve up to an reduction in the risk of concussion compared to standard EPS helmets Furthermore we construct an optimization framework for airbag helmets to minimize concussion and severe head injury risks at different impact velocities while avoiding excessive deformation and An optimized airbag helmet with m thickness at 72 8 kPa reduces the head injury criterion HIC value to 190 25 at head impact velocity compared to a HIC of 1300 with a standard EPS helmet Based on a correlation with previously reported HIC values in the literature this airbag helmet design substantially

the potential for increased tumor penetration and facile synthesis We report a knottin conjugate KDC and demonstrate that it can selectively deliver gemcitabine to malignant cells expressing integrins This KDC binds to tumor cells with affinity is internalized by an process releases its payload intracellularly and is a highly potent inhibitor of brain breast ovarian and pancreatic cancer cell lines Notably these features enable this KDC to bypass a mechanism found in pancreatic cancer cells This work expands the therapeutic relevance of knottin peptides to include targeted drug delivery and

pharmacologic with only one prior report of surgical revascularization to our knowledge We report four cases of Noonan syndrome patients presenting with headaches sensorimotor strokes in childhood that caused unilateral sensorimotor impairment Cerebral angiography and MRI revealed bilateral moyamoya syndrome All patients underwent successful bilateral revascularization The first patient was a girl who presented following a hemorrhagic stroke and recovered well after indirect bypass The second patient was an adult with a history of childhood stroke whose symptoms progressed in adulthood She underwent a direct bypass and improved but continued to experience TIA at her 4 year The third patient was a girl with headaches and a new onset TIA who failed pharmacological therapy and subsequently underwent bilateral indirect bypass The fourth patient was a woman with worsening headaches and an occluded left middle cerebral artery from unilateral moyamoya syndrome A left sided direct bypass was completed given delayed MRI perfusion with poor augmentation To our knowledge these are the first reported surgical cases of combined Noonan and moyamoya syndrome These cases highlight the need to

treatment and even deeper spiritual significance However despite the attention the disease has received through the millennia it has only been within the past that truly effective treatment options have been available As a result for the vast majority of recorded history individuals with epilepsy have not only had to deal with the uncertainty of their next epileptic seizure but also the concomitant stigma and ostracization Interestingly these individuals have included several prominent historical figures including Julius Caesar Vladimir Lenin and Fyodor Dostoyevsky The fact that epilepsy has appeared in the lives of influential historical people means that the disease has played some role in affecting the progress of human civilization Epilepsy has cut short the lives of key political leaders affected the output of talented cultural icons and especially within the past half century influenced the collective understanding of neuroscience and the human nervous system In

is a fundamental tool in neurooncology to improve local tumor control but it leads to profound and progressive impairments in cognitive function Increased attention to quality of life in neurooncology has accelerated efforts to understand and ameliorate cognitive sequelae Such progress has coincided with a new understanding of the role of CNS progenitor cell populations in normal cognition and in their potential utility for the treatment of neurological diseases The irradiated brain exhibits a host of biochemical and cellular derangements including loss of endogenous neurogenesis demyelination and ablation of endogenous oligodendrocyte progenitor cells These changes in combination with a state of chronic neuroinflammation underlie impairments in memory attention executive function and acquisition of motor and language skills Animal models of brain injury have demonstrated a robust capacity of both neural stem cells and oligodendrocyte progenitor cells to restore cognitive function after brain irradiation likely through a combination of cell replacement and trophic effects Oligodendrocyte progenitor cells exhibit a remarkable capacity to migrate integrate and functionally remyelinate damaged white matter tracts in a variety of preclinical models The authors here critically address the opportunities and challenges in translating regenerative cell therapies from rodents to humans Although valiant attempts to translate neuroprotective therapies in recent decades have almost uniformly failed the authors make the case that harnessing human brain injury as a scientific tool represents a unique opportunity to both successfully translate a neuroregenerative therapy and to acquire tools to facilitate future restorative therapies for human traumatic and degenerative

resection have not accounted for molecular subgroup We analysed the prognostic value of extent of resection in a retrospectively identified patients who had a histological diagnosis of medulloblastoma and complete data about extent of resection and survival from centres participating in the Medulloblastoma Advanced Genomics International Consortium We collected from resections done between April 1997 and February 2013 at 35 international institutions We established medulloblastoma subgroup affiliation by gene expression profiling on frozen or tissues We classified extent of resection on the basis of postoperative imaging as gross total resection no residual tumour resection cm 2 tumour remaining or resection cm 2 tumour remaining We did multivariable analyses of overall survival and survival using the variables molecular subgroup WNT SHH group 4 and group 3 age 3 vs years old metastatic status metastases vs no metastases geographical location of therapy North vs rest of the world receipt of chemotherapy yes vs no and receipt of craniospinal irradiation 30 Gy or 30 Gy vs no craniospinal irradiation The primary analysis outcome was the effect of extent of resection by molecular subgroup and the effects of other clinical variables on overall and included 787 patients with medulloblastoma 86 with WNT tumours 242 with SHH tumours 163 with group 3 tumours and 296 with group 4 tumours in our multivariable Cox models of and overall survival We found that the prognostic benefit of increased extent of resection for patients with medulloblastoma is attenuated after molecular subgroup affiliation is taken into account We identified a survival benefit for gross total resection over resection hazard ratio HR 95 CI but no overall survival benefit HR We saw no survival or overall survival benefit for gross total resection compared with resection HR for survival and HR for overall survival No significant survival benefit existed for greater extent of resection for patients with WNT SHH or group 3 tumours HR for resection vs gross total resection For patients with group 4 tumours gross total resection conferred a benefit to survival compared with resection HR especially for those with metastatic disease HR However gross total resection had no effect on overall survival compared with resection in patients with group 4 tumours HR prognostic benefit of increased extent of resection for patients with medulloblastoma is attenuated after molecular subgroup affiliation is taken into account Although maximum safe surgical resection should remain the standard of care surgical removal of small residual portions of medulloblastoma is not recommended when the likelihood of neurological morbidity is high because there is no definitive benefit to gross

Direct 6DOF measurements of human head rotation 3DOF and translation 3DOF have not been previously available to examine whether additional DOFs improve injury prediction We measured head impacts in

measured impacts were the first two 6DOF measurements of clinically diagnosed mTBI For this dataset 6DOF criteria were the most predictive of injury more than 3DOF and 3DOF criteria Peak principal strain in the corpus callosum a 6DOF FE criteria was the strongest predictor followed by two criteria that included rotation measurements peak rotational acceleration magnitude and Head Impact Power

was compared to cell death in HEK CYP3A4 overexpressed and cells pretreated with the CYP3A4 inhibitor all cellular systems tested exposure to CBZ 127 μm or SRT 5 μm alone caused negligible cytotoxicity By contrast CBZ tested at a much lower concentration 17 μm in combination with SRT 5 μm produced prominent cytotoxicity within 15 min exposure In neurons and HBMECs cytotoxicity was associated with increased nitrite levels suggesting involvement of free radicals as a pathogenetic mechanism Pretreatment of HBMECs with reduced GSH or with the GSH precursor prevented cytotoxic response In HEK cells the cytotoxic response to the CBZ SRT combination correlated with the rate of CBZ biotransformation and production of CBZ further suggesting a causative role of reactive metabolites In the same system cytotoxicity was potentiated by overexpression of CYP3A4 and prevented by CYP3A4 results demonstrate an unexpected neurotoxic interaction between CBZ and SRT apparently related to increased production of reactive CBZ metabolites The potential clinical implications of these findings are discussed View details for DOI View details for Web of Science ID 000351240300016

tumors is followed by chemotherapy and radiation to ablate remaining malignant cell populations Targeting these populations stands to reduce tumor recurrence and offer the promise of more complete therapy Thus improving access to the tumor while leaving normal brain tissue unscathed is a critical pursuit A central challenge in this endeavor lies in the limited delivery of therapeutics to the tumor itself The barrier BBB is responsible for much of this difficulty but also provides an essential separation from systemic circulation Due to the BBB physical and chemical constraints many current therapies from cytotoxic drugs to proteins can not gain access to the tumor This review describes the characteristics of the BBB and associated changes wrought by the presence of a tumor Current strategies for enhancing the delivery of therapies across the BBB to the tumor will be discussed with a distinction made between strategies that seek to disrupt the BBB and those that aim to circumvent it View details for DOI View details for PubMedID 25727231 View details for PubMedCentralID PMC4493051 Joint eQTL assessment of whole blood and dura mater tissue from individuals with

Injury Annals of biomedical engineering Hernandez Wu Yip Laksari Hoffman Lopez Grant Kleiven Camarillo B 2015 43 8 Abstract This preliminary study investigated whether direct measurement of head rotation improves prediction of mild traumatic brain injury mTBI Although many studies have implicated rotation as a primary cause of mTBI regulatory safety standards use 3 3DOF kinematic criteria to predict injury Direct 6DOF measurements of human head rotation 3DOF and translation 3DOF have not been previously available to examine whether additional DOFs improve injury prediction We measured head impacts in American football boxing and mixed martial arts using 6DOF instrumented mouthguards and predicted injury using 12 existing kinematic criteria and 6 existing brain finite element FE criteria Among 513 measured impacts were the first two 6DOF measurements of clinically diagnosed mTBI For this dataset 6DOF criteria were the most predictive of injury more than 3DOF and 3DOF criteria Peak principal strain in the corpus callosum a 6DOF FE criteria was the strongest predictor followed by two criteria that included rotation measurements peak rotational acceleration magnitude and Head Impact Power HIP These results suggest head rotation measurements may improve injury prediction However more 6DOF data is needed to confirm this evaluation of existing injury criteria and to develop new criteria that considers directional sensitivity to injury View details for PubMedID 25533767 Joint eQTL assessment of whole blood and dura mater tissue from individuals with Chiari type I malformation BMC genomics Lock Soldano Garrett Cope Markunas Fuchs Grant Dunson Gregory 2015 16 11 Abstract Expression quantitative trait loci eQTL play an important role in the regulation of gene expression Gene expression levels and eQTLs are expected to vary from tissue to tissue and therefore analyses are necessary to fully understand complex genetic conditions in humans Dura mater tissue likely interacts with cranial bone growth and thus may play a role in the etiology of Chiari Type I Malformation CMI and related conditions but it is often inaccessible and its gene expression has not been well studied A genetic basis to CMI has been established however the specific genetic risk factors are not well present an assessment of eQTLs for whole blood and dura mater tissue from individuals with CMI A analysis identified 239 eQTLs in either dura or blood with 79 of these eQTLs shared by both tissues Several identified eQTLs were novel and these implicate genes involved in bone development IPO8 XYLT1 and PRKAR1A and ribosomal pathways related to marrow and bone dysfunction as potential candidates in the development of strong overall heterogeneity in expression levels between blood and dura the majority of are shared by both tissues The power to detect shared eQTLs was improved by using an integrative statistical approach The identified and shared eQTLs provide new insight into the genetic basis for CMI and related conditions View details for PubMedID 25609184 View details for PubMedCentralID PMC4342828 Responsive stimulation of motor cortex for medically and

response is highly variable To understand the mechanism s of primary resistance and identify pathways cooperating with aberrant SHH signaling we sequenced and profiled a large cohort of n 133 SHH pathway mutations involved PTCH1 across all age groups SUFU infants including germline and SMO adults Children 3 years old harbored an excess of downstream MYCN and GLI2 amplifications and frequent TP53 mutations often in the germline all of which were rare in infants and adults Functional assays in different xenograft models demonstrated that harboring a PTCH1 mutation were responsive to SMO inhibition whereas tumors harboring an SUFU mutation or MYCN amplification were primarily resistant View details for DOI View details for PubMedID 24651015 A Bioengineered Peptide that Localizes to and Illuminates Medulloblastoma A New Tool with Potential for Surgical Resection Cureus Ackerman Wilson Kahn Kintzing Jindal Cheshier Grant Cochran 2014 6 9 Abstract Tumors of the central nervous system are challenging to treat due to the limited effectiveness and associated toxicities of chemotherapy and radiation therapy For tumors that can be removed surgically extent of malignant tissue resection has been shown to correlate with disease progression recurrence and survival Thus improved technologies for brain tumor imaging are critically needed as tools for guided surgical resection We previously engineered a novel peptide that binds with high affinity and unique specificity to αVβ3 αVβ5 and α5β1 integrins which are present on tumor cells and the vasculature of many cancers including brain tumors In the current study we conjugated this engineered peptide to a near infrared fluorescent dye Alexa Fluor 680 and used the resulting molecular probe for whole body imaging of medulloblastoma xenograft tumors implanted in the cerebellum of mice The engineered peptide exhibited robust targeting and illumination of intracranial medulloblastoma following both intravenous and intraperitoneal injection routes In contrast a variant of the engineered peptide containing a scrambled sequence did not localize to brain tumors demonstrating that is driven by specific integrin interactions Ex vivo imaging was used to confirm the presence of tumor and molecular probe localization to the cerebellar region These results warrant further clinical development of the engineered peptide as a tool for resection of central nervous system tumors View details for PubMedID 28729960 Reorganization and stability for motor and language areas using cortical stimulation case example and review of the literature Brain sciences Serafini Komisarow Gallentine Mikati Bonner Kranz Haglund Grant 2013 3 4 Abstract The cerebral organization of language in epilepsy patients has been studied with invasive procedures such as Wada testing and electrical cortical stimulation mapping and more recently with noninvasive neuroimaging techniques such as functional MRI In the setting of a chronic seizure disorder clinical variables have been shown to contribute to cerebral language reorganization underscoring the need for language lateralization and localization procedures We present a pediatric patient with a refractory epilepsy disorder who underwent two neurosurgical resections of a left frontal epileptic focus separated by a year He was mapped extraoperatively through a subdural grid using cortical stimulation to preserve motor and language functions The clinical history and extensive workup prior to surgery is discussed as well as the opportunity to compare the cortical maps for language motor and sensory function before each resection Reorganization in cortical tongue sensory areas was seen concomitant with a new zone of ictal and interictal activity in the previous tongue sensory area Detailed neuropsychological data is presented before and after any surgical intervention to hypothesize about the extent of reorganization between epochs We conclude that intrahemispheric cortical plasticity does occur following frontal lobe resective surgery in a teenager with medically refractory seizures View details for DOI View details for PubMedID 24961623 View
