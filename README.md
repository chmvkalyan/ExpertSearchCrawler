# ExpertSearchCrawler

The purpose of this code is to improve upon the data collection for the ExpertSearch project (link). 

## Improvement
In the ExpertSearch project the database is collected manually as follows:

- Go to university's website
- Go to department's webpage
- Go to faculty directory page
- Extract links of faculty bio pages
- Process and download from faculty bio page

This process is manual, strenous, time-consuming and not dynamic.

The proposed method in the ExpertSearchCrawler is to automate many of these tasks.
