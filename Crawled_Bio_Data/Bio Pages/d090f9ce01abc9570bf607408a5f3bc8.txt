Abstract OBJECTIVES It would be a medically important advance if durable and focal neuromodulation of the brain could be delivered noninvasively and without ablation This ongoing study seeks to elucidate the effects of precisely delivered ionizing radiation upon focal brain metabolism and the corresponding cellular integrity at that target We hypothesize that focally delivered ionizing radiation to the brain can yield focal metabolic changes without lesioning the brain in the AND METHODS We used stereotactic radiosurgery to deliver doses from 10 Gy to 120Gy to the left primary motor cortex M1 of Lee Sung miniature pigs n 8 One additional animal served as a nonirradiated control We used positron emission tomography to quantify radiation effects by calculating the ratio of standard uptake values SUV of 18 F 18 between the radiated left and irradiated right hemispheres across We found that the SUV ratio at the targeted M1 was significantly lowered from the baseline measurements for animals receiving 60Gy or higher with the effect persisting at ninemonths after radiosurgery Only at 120Gy was a lesion suggesting ablation visible at the M1 target Animals treated at showed a reduced signal in the absence of an identifiable lesion a result consistent with the occurrence of Focal noninvasive and durable changes in brain activity can be induced without a magnetic resonance imaging MRI lesion a result that may be consistent with the occurrence of neuromodulation This approach may provide new venues for the investigation of neuromodulatory treatments for disorders involving dysfunctional brain circuits Postmortem pathological analysis is needed to elucidate whether there have been morphological changes not detected by MRI View details for DOI View details for

e7031 Abstract Objective Neurosurgeons have taken on the role of innovators continuing to move the field forward over the centuries More recently innovation has taken the form of new technological devices and therapeutics which require patenting The aim of this study is to identify major areas of innovation in the field of neurosurgery by evaluating patent records Methods This study quantifies the number of patents the American Association of Neurological Surgeons AANS neurosurgeons hold across different subspecialties The United States Patent and Trademark Office USPTO patent database was queried using the names of AANS members who filed patents between 1976 and 2019 Results A total of 346 AANS neurosurgeons hold a total of patents The number of patents held by each neurosurgeon ranged from one to 109 The areas that patents were filed under include cellular and genetic science 40 drug delivery 45 image guidance 82 neuromodulation 52 pain 7 peripheral nerve stimulation 24 spine 398 surgical devices 148 trauma 16 tumor 78 vascular 67 and other 68 No patents were filed under pediatrics 0 The fields with the greatest number of filed patents are spine and image guidance Conclusion Given the technical nature of the field of neurosurgery instruments and devices that improve localization visualization targeting and spinal reconstruction are often in demand Furthermore since the rates of spinal procedures and implants continue to increase higher patenting may be motivated by the opportunity to develop new products that can result in royalty payments to neurosurgeons The advent of new technologies undoubtedly continues to push the field of neurosurgery forward View details for DOI View details for PubMedID 32211264 View details for PubMedCentralID PMC7082787

radiosurgery in a porcine model Scientific reports Zaer Glud Schneider Lukacova Vang Hansen Adler HÃ¸yer Jensen Hansen Hoffmann Worm SÃ¸rensen Orlowski 2020 10 1 16223 Abstract Stereotactic radiosurgery SRS has proven an effective tool for the treatment of brain tumors arteriovenous malformation and functional conditions However therapeutic effect in viable cells in functional SRS is also suggested Evaluation of the proposed modulatory effect of irradiation on neuronal activity without causing cellular death requires the knowledge of radiation dose tolerance at very small tissue volume Therefore we aimed to establish a porcine model to study the effects of radiosurgical doses in small volumes of the brain Five minipigs received focal stereotactic radiosurgery with single large doses of Gy to mm fields in the left primary motor cortex and the right subcortical white matter and one animal remained as unirradiated control The animals were with serial MRI PET scans and histology 6 months We observed a relation of the histological and MRI changes at 6 months The necrotic lesions were seen in the grey matter at 100 Gy and in white matter at 60 Gy Furthermore small volume radiosurgery at different dose levels induced vascular as well as neuronal cell changes and glial cell remodeling View details for DOI View details for PubMedID 33004849 View details for

trigeminal neuralgia TN is one of the most demanding of all radiosurgery procedures requiring accurate delivery and sharp dose fall off a new innovative frameless radiosurgical device maybe an attractive platform for the treatment of TN and other functional brain disorders Here we compared the dosimetry of plans for a single patient to that generated by a dedicated radiosurgery device the CyberKnife Methods Radiosurgery plans that delineated the cranial nerve from a single patient fused computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging data set were planned on both the and CyberKnife with the latter serving as a validated benchmark The same target and treatment planning constraints were applied Plans were evaluated by a physician with experience treating TN and a medical physicist The treatment plan used two isocenters delivered through collimators based on a plan that delivered MU through 81 beams The CyberKnife plans used a collimator for a plan that delivered MU through 88 beams Results Based on visual inspection the isodose volumes covered by and CyberKnife were similar at the prescription isodose 70 and 80 respectively with a maximum dose Dmax of 7500 cGy The conformality index was better for the CyberKnife as compared to However the irradiated volumes were smaller at the 50 20 and 10 isodoses for cc cc and for cc cc and cc for CyberKnife In particular the 20 and 10 isodose volumes were much smaller for especially on the axial and sagittal planes Conclusions treatment planning for TN compares favorably with equivalent planning on CyberKnife The brain volumes containing the 20 and 10 isodoses are smaller using thus relatively sparing critical structures close to the target including the Gasserian ganglion and brainstem This feature could be of clinical relevance by potentially reducing complications View details for DOI View details for PubMedID 32617203 View details for PubMedCentralID PMC7325335 Update of Stereotactic Radiosurgery for

dedicated to brain and head and neck radiosurgery By utilizing a linear accelerator and incorporating a design in which a beam stop and major mechanical elements serve a radiation shielding function the does not typically require a radiation bunker The unique collimator design of the is especially critical to the performance of the overall system The collimator consists of a shielded tungsten wheel oriented with its rotational axis perpendicular to the beam central axis the goal of this design is to minimize radiation leakage Beam selection is accomplished by rotating the wheel within its housing We investigated radiation leakage from the collimator to determine its compliance with internationally accepted standards using direct radiation measurements Materials and methods To measure collimator leakage in the plane of the patient equidistant measurement stations were defined in a plane perpendicular to the central beam axis cax 1 m from this axis 1 m from the radiation focal spot To measure leakage alongside and adjacent to the accelerator equidistant measurement stations were located 1 m from the cax along a line parallel to the cax in the plane of the collimator wheel and along a line parallel to the cax 90 degrees offset from the first line of stations Results Radiation leakage emanating from the collimating head of the linear accelerator in the patient plane ranged between and mR Radiation along the linear accelerator 1000 R delivered in the primary beam varied between and mR and constituted between to of the primary beam The former radiation originated from target leakage while the latter is produced directly by the linear accelerator and both contributed to the overall leakage radiation that would reach a patient Discussion Due to the large diameter of the tungsten collimator wheel and the massive tungsten cylindrical collimator shield the overall patient leakage is of the primary beam at a distance from the beam central axis in the patient plane Leakage radiation in the patient plane is limited by the International Electrotechnical Commission IEC to of the total primary radiation Radiation leakage along the linear accelerator and the collimator housing was determined to be of primary radiation intensity This leakage value is lower than the leakage limit stipulated by IEC by more than a factor of 100 Conclusions Typically an MV radiation therapy system minimizes exposure by utilizing a combination of device and structural shielding However the has been uniquely designed to minimize the need for structural shielding Our results indicate radiation leakage from the collimator meets internationally accepted standards as defined by the IEC View details for PubMedID 29632755 Update of Stereotactic Radiosurgery for Benign

Using Removable Megavoltage Radiation Detectors CUREUS Jenkins Kahn Weidlich Adler 2017 9 11 e1889 Abstract Introduction Accurate dose delivery is critical to the success of stereotactic radiosurgery Unfortunately verification of the accuracy of treatment delivery remains a challenging problem Existing radiosurgery delivery paradigms are limited in their ability to verify the accurate delivery of radiation beams using data sampled from the beam after it has traversed the patient The Radiosurgery System Zap Surgical Systems San Carlos CA addresses this issue by implementing a fully integrated treatment delivery system that utilizes a factory commissioned megavoltage MV imager to measure the transmitted beam The measured intensity is then compared with an expected value in order to confirm that treatment is proceeding as expected The purpose of this study was to evaluate a prototype system and investigate the accuracy of an attenuation model used in generating the expected transmitted intensity values Methods A prototype MV imager was used to measure transmitted beam intensities at various exposure levels and through several thicknesses of solid water The data were used to evaluate imager linearity and model accuracy Results Experimental results indicate that a quadratic attenuation model is appropriate for predicting beam attenuation and that the imager exhibits excellent dose linearity Conclusions The MV imager system is shown to be capable of accurately acquiring the data needed to confirm treatment validity View details for PubMedID 29392101 Impact of CyberKnife

the brain is currently under development In the proposed design the machine is entirely The main advantage of a system is the simplification of the system installation which can reduce the cost of radiosurgery In this way more patients can benefit from this minimally invasive and highly effective type of procedure For technical reasons space inside the shielded region is limited which leads to constraints on the design Here two axes of rotation move a linear accelerator around the patient head at a source axis distance of 400 millimeters mm while the integrated patient table is characterized by two additional rotational and one translational degrees of freedom Eight cone collimators of different diameters are available The system can change the collimator automatically during treatment using a collimator wheel Since the linear accelerator can only move with two rotational axes it is not possible to reposition the beam translationally as it is in six degrees of freedom robotic radiosurgery To achieve translational repositioning it is necessary to move the patient couch Thus translational repositioning must be kept to a minimum during treatment Our goal in this contribution is a preliminary investigation of dose distributions attainable with this type of design Thus we do not intend to design and evaluate the treatment planning system itself but rather to establish that appropriate dose distributions can be achieved with this designunder realistic clinical circumstances Our simulation suggests that dose gradients and conformity for complex target shapes corresponding to systems can be achieved with this construction althougha detailed evaluation of the system itself would be needed in the future View details for PubMedID 29152420 Treatment

questionnaires were completed by the 30 patients on trial Compliance with HRQOL assessment was 76 at 12 months Communication deficit significantly worsened over time with a decline of points per month No significant changes over time were detected in the other 8 scales of our primary analysis including global quality of life Although 8 patients 27 experienced adverse radiation effects ARE on this dose escalation trial it was not associated with a statistically significant decline in any of the primary HRQOL scales Disease progression was associated with communication deficit with patients experiencing an average worsening of points per month after progression compared with points per month before progression this dose escalation protocol for newly diagnosed GBM overall HRQOL remained

Hippocampus after Single Irradiation Cureus Ouyang Y Ning Adler Maciver Knox Giffard 2017 9 6 e1414 Abstract The effects of high dose gamma radiation on brain tissue are poorly understood with both limited and major changes reported The present study compared the effects of gamma irradiation on the expression of interneuron markers within the hippocampal cornu ammonis 1 CA1 region with expression in control matched rats This area was chosen for study because of its circuitry Male rats were exposed to 60 Gy of whole brain gamma radiation and after 24 or 48 hours the brains were removed fixed and sectioned to quantitate expression of parvalbumin PV CB reelin NPY and somatostatin All of these markers increased in expression over the first 48 hours except NPY which decreased This provides novel information on changes in gene expression in the hippocampal interneurons following radiation Staining for Beclin 1 a marker of autophagy increased most strongly in the subgranular zone SGZ of the dentate gyrus DG Overall the results are consistent with the hypothesis that increased intracellular calcium follows irradiation leading to an increased expression of calcium binding proteins Increased autophagy occurs in the neurogenic zone of the dentate hilus consistent with reduced effective neurogenesis after irradiation View details for PubMedID 28861331 View details for

Developments in the Management of Head and Neck Paragangliomas ENDOCRINE REVIEWS Taieb Kaliski Boedeker Martucci Fojo Adler Pacak 2014 35 5 Abstract Head and neck paragangliomas HNPGLs are rare neuroendocrine tumors belonging to the family of neoplasms Despite advances in understanding the pathogenesis of these tumors the growth potential and clinical outcome of individual cases remains largely unpredictable Over several decades surgical resection has long been the treatment of choice for HNPGLs However increasing experience in various forms of radiosurgery has been reported to result in outcomes even for tumors localized in the most inaccessible anatomical areas The emergence of such new therapies challenges the traditional paradigm for the management of HNPGLs This review will assist and guide physicians who encounter patients with such tumors either from a diagnostic or therapeutic standpoint This review will also particularly emphasize current and emerging knowledge in genetics imaging and therapeutic options as well as the quality of life for patients with HNPGLs View details for DOI View details for Web of Science ID 000342346200004 View details for PubMedID

colon breast melanoma gynecologic other a median of 12 months range months median overall survival was 17 months of 165 patients 13 developed LMD at a median of 5 months range months following SRS The cumulative incidence rates with death as a competing risk were 10 95 confidence interval CI 6 for developing LF 54 95 CI 46 for DF and 11 95 CI 7 for LMD On univariate analysis only breast cancer histology hazard ratio was associated with an increased risk of LMD The cumulative incidence of LMD was 24 95 CI 9 for breast cancer compared to 9 95 CI 5 for histology patients treated with SRS targeting the postoperative cavity following resection those with breast cancer histology were at higher risk of LMD It is unknown whether the inclusion of irradiation or novel strategies such as

of CyberKnife CK stereotactic radiosurgery SRS for the management of central nervous system chondrosarcomas has not been previously reported To evaluate outcomes of primary recurrent and metastatic chondrosarcomas of the skull base and spine treated with CK SRS a retrospective observational study of 16 patients treated between 1996 and 2011 with CK SRS was performed using an database at Stanford University Medical Center Twenty lesions 12 cranial 8 spinal across six males and ten females were analyzed The median age at SRS was 51 years and median was 33 months Median tumor volume was cmÂ³ and median marginal dosages were 22 24 26 27 and 30 Gy for one to five fractionations respectively Overall survival rates were 88 88 80 and 66 at 1 3 5 and 10 years after initial presentation Survival rates at 1 3 and 5 years after CK were 81 67 and 55 respectively Actuarial tumor control was 41 13 at 60 months At 36 months tumor control was 80 in primary lesions 50 in recurrent lesions and in metastatic disease p Tumor control was 58 in cranial lesions and 38 in spinal lesions Radiation injury was reported in one patient CK SRS appears to be a safe adjuvant therapy and offers moderate control for primary cranial chondrosarcoma lesions There appears to be a clinically albeit not statistically significant trend towards poorer outcomes in similarly treated metastatic recurrent and

Venteicher Soltys Gibbs Harsh Adler Chang 2013 80 Abstract OBJECTIVE For multisession radiosurgery no published data relate the volume and dose of cochlear irradiation to quantified risk of hearing loss We conducted a retrospective dosimetric study to evaluate the relationship between hearing loss after stereotactic radiosurgery SRS and the of irradiated cochlea METHODS Cochlear dose data were retrospectively collected on consecutive patients who underwent SRS 18 Gy in 3 sessions for vestibular schwanoma between 1999 and 2005 at Stanford University Hospital Inclusion criteria included GR grade I or II hearing prior to radiosurgical treatment complete audiograms and magnetic resonance imaging MRI A cochlea histogram was generated for each of the 94 patients who qualified for this study RESULTS GR grade hearing posttreatment was maintained in 74 of patients Median time to last audiogram was years range and to last MRI was years range Each higher level of cochlear irradiation was associated with increased risk of hearing loss Larger cochlear volume was associated with lower risk of hearing loss Controlling for differences in cochlear volume among subjects each additional mm 3 of cochlea receiving 10 to 16 Gy single session equivalent doses of Gy3 significantly increased the odds of hearing loss by approximately 5 CONCLUSIONS Larger cochlear volume is associated with lower risk of hearing loss following trisession SRS for vestibular schwannoma Controlling for this phenomenon higher radiation dose and larger irradiated cochlear volume are significantly associated with higher risk of hearing loss This study confirms and quantifies the risk of hearing loss following trisession SRS for vestibular schwannoma View details for DOI View details for PubMedID 22484770 Cavity Volume Dynamics After Resection of Brain Metastases and Timing of Postresection Cavity Stereotactic Radiosurgery NEUROSURGERY Atalar Choi Harsh Chang Gibbs Adler Soltys 2013 72 2 Abstract An alternative treatment option to irradiation after surgical resection of brain metastases is resection cavity stereotactic radiosurgery SRS review the dynamics of cavity volume change after surgical resection with the goal of determining the optimal timing for cavity tumor cavity and cavity volumes were measured for 68 cavities in 63 patients treated with surgery and postresection cavity SRS Percent differences between volumes were calculated and correlation analyses were performed to assess volume changes before and after the majority of tumors the postresection cavity volume was smaller than the preresection tumor volume by a median percent volume change of range to 1258 with larger preresection tumors resulting in greater cavity shrinkage P To determine the optimal timing for cavity SRS we examined cavity volume dynamics by comparing the early postresection postoperative days and treatment planning magnetic resonance imaging scans median time to magnetic resonance imaging 20 days range days and found no association between the postresection day number and volume change P The volume decrease resulting from tumor resection was offset by the addition of a clinical target volume margin which is our current greatest volume change occurs immediately after surgery postoperative days with no statistically significant volume change occurring up to 33 days after surgery for most patients Therefore there is no benefit of cavity shrinkage in waiting longer than the first 1 to 2 weeks to perform cavity SRS View details for DOI View details for Web of Science ID 000313734400028

of opiate addicts after bilateral stereotactic nucleus accumbens NAc ablative patients were followed up for 5 years and abstinent status and adverse events were evaluated NAc lesion volumes and locations were obtained by postoperative MRI scans The Chinese version of the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire the Symptom the Beck Depression Inventory BDI the Obsessive Compulsive Scale and the World Health Organization Quality of Life Questionnaire Brief Version were administered to the patients before and 5 years after the stereotactic total abstinence rate of all patients in their 5th postoperative year was The abstinent patients had a significantly larger lesion volume than the relapsed ones but a larger lesion volume also increased the risk of adverse events 5 years after surgery the abstinent patients showed significant decreases on the Psychoticism and Neuroticism scores by a significant decline on the Global Severity Index and the subscores in all 10 dimensions by significant decreases on the BDI and scores and significant improvements on the scores of all domains by while for the relapsed patients only the subscores of by and the scores significantly decreased Postoperative analysis revealed that the abstinent patients had a significantly better score than the relapsed ones by various instruments and NAc lesion volumes and locations did not correlate with the outcome of any of these bilateral ablation of NAc by stereotactic neurosurgery was a feasible method for alleviating psychological dependence on opiate drugs and preventing a relapse suggested that surgery can improve the personality and psychopathological profile of opiate addicts with a trend towards normal levels provided persistent abstinence can be maintained relapse on the other hand

79 4 Abstract To integrate 3D digital rotation angiography DRA and 2D digital subtraction angiography DSA imaging into a targeting methodology enabling comprehensive robotic radiosurgery of arteriovenous malformations AVMs geometric integrity was evaluated by imaging a phantom with embedded markers Dedicated DSA acquisition modes with preset positions were configured The geometric reproducibility of the presets was determined and its impact on localization accuracy was evaluated An imaging protocol composed of and lateral DSA series in combination with a DRA run without couch displacement between acquisitions was introduced Software was developed for registration of DSA and DRA images to correct for a small misalignments of the with respect to the estimated geometry of the set positions and b potential patient motion between image series Within the software correlated navigation of registered DRA and DSA images was incorporated to localize AVMs within a 3D image coordinate space Subsequent treatment planning and delivery followed a standard robotic radiosurgery spatial distortions were typically smaller than mm throughout a volume With image registration localization uncertainties resulting from the achievable reproducibility of the set positions could be reduced to about mm Overall localization uncertainty within the DRA coordinate space was mm frameless robotic radiosurgical treatments with this technique were integration of DRA and DSA into the process of nidus localization increases the confidence with which radiosurgical ablation of AVMs can be performed when using only an technique Such an approach can increase patient comfort decrease time pressure on clinical and technical staff and possibly reduce the number of cerebral angiograms

radiosurgery and SBRT Lieberson Mener Choi Kalani Soltys Gibbs Heit Adler Chang 2011 1 3 Abstract Epidermoid cysts of the central nervous system may be difficult to resect and recurrent lesions may be impossible to control with open surgery We identified three patients with recurrent epidermoids treated with radiosurgery at Stanford One patient with a middle fossa lesion that had been resected twice in six years presented with a cubic centimeter recurrence and was treated with radiosurgery scans over three years showed no additional growth Two patients had spinal lesions One had undergone numerous unsuccessful procedures in the three years before the radiosurgical treatment and subsequent open resection of a cubic centimeter recurrence His scans remain unremarkable eight years after treatment The other with acaudaequina mass had required five open resections in 11 years Following the last resection the residual was treated radiosurgically The lesion eventually increased in size but became symptomatic only after seven years A second course of radiosurgery was delivered We believe that stereotactic radiosurgery can be safe for some epidermoid cysts of the central nervous

Heilbrun Adler 2010 113 1 Abstract Neurosurgeons radiation oncologists and increasingly other surgical specialists recognize that radiosurgery is an important tool for managing selected disorders throughout the body The partnership between neurosurgeons and radiation oncologists has resulted in collaborative studies that have established the clinical benefits of radiosurgery Today however a range of political and financial issues is straining this relationship and thereby undermining the practice of radiosurgery Neurosurgeons and radiation oncologists recently restricted the definition of radiosurgery to include only and radiation treatments Meanwhile organized radiation oncology decided unilaterally that radiosurgery administered to other parts of the body would be termed stereotactic body radiation therapy Finally neurosurgical and radiation oncology coding experts developed new Current Procedural Terminology codes for cranial vault and spine radiosurgery which were approved for use by the Relative Value Scale Update Committee as of 2009 The authors suggest that the neurosurgery included 1 reasserting that all of the tasks of a radiosurgery procedure remain bundled and 2 agreeing to limit the definition of radiosurgery to cranial vault and failed neurosurgeons who perform radiosurgery and it may jeopardize patient access to this procedure in the future The authors propose that all of the involved medical specialties recognize that the application of focused radiation therapy throughout the body requires a partnership between radiation and surgical disciplines They also urge surgeons to reexamine their coding methods and they maintain that Current Procedural Terminology codes should be consistent across all of the different specialties involved in these procedures Finally surgeons should consider appropriate training in medical physics and radiobiology to perform the tasks involved in these specific procedures ultimately all parties should

5 Abstract Brain arteriovenous malformations BAVMs are an important cause of intracerebral hemorrhage ICH in young adults Biological predictors of future ICH risk are lacking and controversy exists over previous studies of natural history risk among predominantly ruptured BAVM cohorts Recent studies have suggested that the majority of BAVMs are now diagnosed as unruptured lesions and that the risk according to natural history among these lesions may be less than previously assumed In the first part of this review the authors discuss available data on the natural history of BAVMs and highlight the need for future studies that aim to develop surrogate biomarkers of disease progression that accurately predict future risk of ICH in BAVMs The etiology of BAVM remains unknown Recent studies have suggested a role for genetic factors in the pathogenesis of sporadic BAVM which is further supported by reports of familial occurrence of BAVM and association with known systemic genetic disorders such as disease disease and syndrome Molecular characterization of BAVM tissue demonstrates a highly angiogenic milieu with evidence of increased endothelial cell turnover Taken together with a number of reports of de novo BAVM formation radiographic growth after initial BAVM diagnosis and regrowth after successful treatment of BAVM these findings challenge the assumption that BAVMs are static lesions of congenital origin In the second part of this review the authors discuss available data on the origins of BAVM and offer insights into future investigations into genetics and endothelial progenitor cell involvement in the pathogenesis of BAVM Current treatment options for BAVM focus on removal or obliteration of the lesion in an attempt to protect against future ICH risk including microsurgical resection endovascular embolization and stereotactic radiosurgery SRS In the third part of this review the authors discuss available data on SRS in BAVMs and highlight the need for future studies on the radiobiology of BAVMs especially in regard to biomarker detection for tracking SRS response during the latency period Insights from future investigations in BAVM may not only prove important for the development of novel therapies and relevant biomarkers for BAVM but could also potentially benefit a variety of other disorders involving new vessel formation in the CNS

patients who developed delayed myelopathy Six patients 5 women 1 man with a mean age of 48 years range years developed delayed myelopathy at a mean of months range months after spinal radiosurgery Three tumors were metastatic 3 were benign The metastases were in the upper to midthoracic spine whereas the benign tumors were partially in the cervical region Three cases involved previous radiation volume histograms were generated for target and critical structures Clinical and dosimetric factors were analyzed for factors predictive of spinal cord injury Specific dosimetric factors contributing to this complication could not be identified but of the patients with myelopathy received spinal cord biological equivalent doses exceeding 8 myelopathy after radiosurgery is uncommon with the dose schedules used in this case series Radiation injury to the spinal cord occurred over a spectrum of dose parameters that prevented identification of specific dosimetric factors contributing to this complication Primarily biological equivalent dose estimates were not usable for defining spinal cord tolerance to hypofractionated dose schedules We recommend limiting the volume of spinal cord

treating trigeminal neuralgia TN the likelihood of a prompt and durable complete response is not assured Moreover the incidence of facial numbness remains a challenge To address these limitations a new more anatomic radiosurgical procedure was developed that uses the CyberKnife Accuray Sunnyvale CA to lesion an elongated segment of the retrogasserian cisternal portion of the trigeminal sensory

need for an effective noninvasive tool to ablate spinal lesions reflects the limitations of traditional surgical and radiotherapeutic approaches Open surgery is invasive and carries a risk of neurological injury and vertebral column dysfunction Conventional radiotherapy often has poor clinical efficacy and a risk of neurologic complications Spinal radiosurgery has been developed to overcome these limitations This technique consists of precise delivery of radiation to a spinal target To spare the delicate and spinal cord and to avoid potentially devastating neurological complications it is essential that the radiation dose decreases rapidly outside of the target This is accomplished by use of advanced technology treatment planning software and robotics Preliminary data indicate that this approach can achieve high rates of tumor control of spinal and paraspinal lesions and durable reduction of associated vertebral pain without neurological complications Although

CANCER RESEARCH TREATMENT Lipani Jackson Soltys Sato Adler 2008 7 3 Abstract Current therapeutic goals for treatment of Glioblastoma Multiforme GBM involve gross total resection followed by multifractionated focal external beam radiation therapy EBRT Patients treated with optimal therapy have a median survival of approximately months In the present study we sought to determine whether a hypofractionated dosing schedule using CyberKnife is at least as effective as multifractionated focal EBRT A retrospective analysis was conducted on 20 histopathologically confirmed GBM patients treated with CyberKnife at Okayama Kyokuto Hospital in Japan after gross total resection subtotal resection or biopsy Eight patients also received adjuvant ACNU and Vincrisitine chemotherapy according to local protocol however no patient received any other form of radiation besides post CyberKnife treatment The treated tumor volumes ranged from cm 3 cm 3 mean cm 3 The marginal dose D90 ranged from Gy mean Gy with a maximum mean dose of Gy range Gy The prescribed isodose line ranged from with a mean of Treatment was delivered in fractions mean Patients were followed from months mean months Overall median survival was 16 months with 55 of patients alive at 12 months and 34 of patients alive at 24 months Median survival of patients in Recursive Partitioning Analysis RPA classes III or IV

Gafchromic film to assure submillimeter accuracy for radiosurgery MEDICAL DOSIMETRY Ho Gibbs Chang Main Adler 2008 33 1 Abstract The Cyberknife is an radiosurgical system It uses a compact linear accelerator mounted on a robotic arm to deliver radiosurgical doses While routine quality assurance QA is essential for any radiosurgery system QA plays an even more vital role for the Cyberknife system due to the complexity of the system and the wide range of applications This paper presents a technique for performing quality assurance using thermoluminescence detectors TLDs and Gafchromic films that is intended to be specific for the Cyberknife However with minor modification the proposed method can also be used for QA of other radiosurgery systems Our initial QA procedure for the CyberKnife utilized a 30 x 30 x solid water phantom containing a planar array of slots for 1x 1 x TLDs on a grid With the objective of significantly simplifying CyberKnife QA a new procedure for verification was developed which uses much fewer TLDs than the prior solid water phantom technique This new method requires only that the system target dose to the center of a cluster of 7 TLDs In a prior study with Gafchromic films conducted at 3 different Cyberknife facilities the mean clinically relevant error was demonstrated to be mm A similar Gafchromic film analysis replicated these error measurements as part of the present investigation It can not be emphasized enough the importance of implementing routine QA to verify the accuracy of any radiosurgery system Our quality assurance procedure tests the treatment planning system as well as the entire treatment delivery including the image targeting system and the robot system Either TLDs or Gafchromic films may be used for QA test of a radiosurgery system Using both methods for measurement has the advantage independently verifying the accuracy of the system This approach which is routinely in used at our institution has repeatedly confirmed the submillimeter targeting accuracy of our Cyberknife View details for DOI View details for Web of Science ID 000253610200006 View details for PubMedID 18262121 Cyberknife

Accuray Sunnyvale CA total of 95 patients were treated for idiopathic trigeminal neuralgia between May 2002 and October 2005 Radiosurgical dose and volume parameters were retrospectively analyzed in relation to pain response complications and recurrence of symptoms Optimal treatment parameters were identified for patients who had excellent and sustained pain relief with no complications including severe or moderate pain relief was initially experienced by 64 out of 95 patients 67 The median time to pain relief was 14 days range d Posttreatment numbness occurred in 45 47 of the patients treated Using higher radiation doses and treating longer segments of the nerve led to both better pain relief and a higher incidence of hypesthesia The presence of posttreatment numbness was predictive of better pain relief The overall rate of complications was 18 At the mean time of 2 years 47 of the 95 patients 50 had sustained pain relief all of whom were completely off pain results of this study

patients had previous subtotal surgical resection and six had previously been treated with conventional fractionated radiotherapy 6 CyberKnife radiosurgery was delivered in two to five sessions to an average tumor volume of cm3 and a cumulative average marginal dose of Gy Formal visual testing and clinical examinations were performed before treatment and at intervals beginning at 6 a mean visual field of 49 months range mo vision was unchanged postradiosurgery in 38 patients improved in eight 16 and worse in three 6 In each instance visual deterioration was accompanied by tumor progression that ultimately resulted in patient death However one of these patients who had a multiply recurrent adrenocorticotropic pituitary adenoma initially experienced early visual loss without significant tumor progression after both a previous course of radiotherapy and three separate sessions of radiosurgery After a mean magnetic resonance imaging period of 46 months tumor volume was stable or smaller in all other cases Two patients died of unrelated nonbrain radiosurgery resulted in high rates of tumor control and preservation of visual function in this group of perioptic tumors percent of patients retained or improved preradiosurgical vision This experience reinforces the findings from earlier studies that suggested that multisession radiosurgery can be a safe and effective alternative

method for inverse planning in robotic radiosurgery MEDICAL PHYSICS Schweikard Schlaefer Adler 2006 33 11 Abstract By design the range of beam directions in conventional radiosurgery are constrained to an isocentric array However the recent introduction of robotic radiosurgery dramatically increases the flexibility of targeting and as a consequence beams need be neither coplanar nor isocentric Such a nonisocentric design permits a large number of distinct beam directions to be used in one single treatment These major technical differences provide an opportunity to improve upon the principles for treatment planning used with GammaKnife or LINAC radiosurgery With this objective in mind our group has developed over the past decade an inverse planning tool for robotic radiosurgery This system first computes a set of beam directions and then during an optimization step weights each individual beam Optimization begins with a feasibility query the answer to which is derived through linear programming This approach offers the advantage of completeness and avoids local optima Final beam selection is based on heuristics In this report we present and evaluate a new strategy for utilizing the advantages of linear programming to improve beam selection Starting from an initial solution a heuristically determined set of beams is added to the optimization problem while beams

lesions TECHNOLOGY IN CANCER RESEARCH TREATMENT Romanelli Schaal Adler 2006 5 4 Abstract For decades since its introduction stereotactic radiosurgery SRS was used only to treat intracranial lesions because intracranial targets could be immobilized and located relative to a rigid metal frame affixed to the patient head Lesions outside the head were generally not treated with SRS because it is difficult to immobilize extracranial lesions and to attach stereotactic frames elsewhere on the body Advances in computerized image guidance and robotics allowed the development of systems such as the CyberKnife SRS System Accuray Inc Sunnyvale CA that could target intracranial lesions without the stereotactic frame Enhancements have resulted in a radiation delivery system that can accurately deliver focal radiation to lesions in the spine chest and abdomen even if they move during respiration In this review we will describe the technical features of frameless SRS systems and briefly review their application to treating intracranial and extracranial lesions focusing in particular on spinal lesions View details for Web of Science ID 000240089900014 View details for PubMedID 16866572 Computer aided robotic radiosurgery Computer aided surgery Romanelli Schweikard Schlaefer Adler J 2006 11 4 Abstract Radiosurgery involves the precise delivery of sharply collimated beams of radiation to a distinct target volume along selected trajectories Historically accurate targeting required the application of a stereotactic frame thus limiting the use of this procedure to single treatments of selected intracranial lesions However the scope of radiosurgery has undergone a remarkable broadening since the introduction of robotic radiosurgery Recent developments in image guidance provide an effective frameless alternative to conventional radiosurgery and allow both the treatment of lesions outside the skull and the possibility of performing hypofractionation As a consequence targets in the spine chest and abdomen can now also be radiosurgically ablated with submillimetric precision Meanwhile the combination of image guidance robotic beam delivery and inverse planning can greatly enhance the conformality and homogeneity of radiosurgery The aim of this article is to describe the technological basis of radiosurgery and provide a perspective on future developments The current clinical usage of robotic radiosurgery will be reviewed with an emphasis on those applications that may represent a major shift in the therapeutic paradigm View details for PubMedID 17060075

2003 Conference Russakoff Rohlfing Mori Rueckert Ho Adler Maurer ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS 2005 Abstract Generation of digitally reconstructed radiographs DRRs is computationally expensive and is typically the step in the execution time of to registration algorithms We address this computational issue by extending the technique of light field rendering from the computer graphics community The extension of light fields which we call attenuation fields AFs allows most of the DRR computation to be performed in a preprocessing step after this precomputation step DRRs can be generated substantially faster than with conventional ray casting We derive expressions for the physical sizes of the two planes of an AF necessary to generate DRRs for a given camera geometry and all possible object motion within a specified range Because an AF is a data structure it is substantially more memory efficient than a huge table of precomputed DRRs because it eliminates the redundancy of replicated rays Nonetheless an AF can require substantial memory which we address by compressing it using vector quantization We compare DRRs generated using AFs to those generated using ray casting for a typical geometry and computed tomography images of several anatomic regions They are quantitatively very similar the median peak ratio of versus is greater than 43 dB in all cases We perform registration using and and evaluate registration accuracy using clinical spine image data from four patients The registration accuracy and robustness of the two methods is virtually identical whereas

treatment of acoustic neuromas Prior reports using radiosurgery consistently have shown excellent tumor control but only up to a 50 to 73 likelihood of maintaining hearing at pretreatment levels Staged radiosurgery using interfraction intervals previously has been shown by our group to achieve excellent tumor control while increasing the rate of hearing preservation at 2 years to 77 The

computed tomography image to one or more projection images has a number of therapy applications In general fiducial methods are fast accurate and robust but marker implantation is not always possible often is considered too invasive to be clinically acceptable and entails risk There also is the unresolved issue of whether it is acceptable to leave markers permanently implanted registration methods do not require the use of markers and can be automated because such geometric features as points and surfaces do not need to be segmented from the images However for spine images methods are susceptible to local optima in the cost function and thus need initial transformations that are close to the correct this report we propose a hybrid similarity measure for registration that is a weighted combination of an similarity measure mutual information and a measure using one fiducial marker We evaluate its registration accuracy and robustness by using clinical spine image data from four registration errors for successful registrations for the four patients were and mm for the and hybrid similarity measures respectively Whereas the percentage of successful registrations registration error mm decreased rapidly as the initial transformation got further from the correct transformation the incorporation of a single marker produced successful registrations more than 99 of the time independent of the initial use of one fiducial marker reduces spine image registration error slightly and improves robustness substantially The findings are potentially relevant for therapy If one marker is sufficient to obtain clinically acceptable registration accuracy and robustness as the preliminary results using the proposed hybrid similarity measure suggest the marker can be placed on a spinous process which could be accomplished without penetrating muscle or using fluoroscopic guidance and such a marker could be removed relatively easily View details for DOI View details

radiosurgical system Accuray Sunnyvale CA uses implanted stainless steel fiducials The purpose of this study was to evaluate the total system for clinically relevant accuracy of this clinically relevant accuracy of the CyberKnife depends on 1 the accuracy of beam delivery which in turn represents a compilation of robot and camera errors and 2 the inherent accuracy of target localization that stems from computed tomographic imaging and treatment planning The clinically relevant accuracy was measured at three different CyberKnife facilities using head and torso phantoms loaded with packs of radiochromic film and expressed as a displacement of the dose contours from the treatment mean clinically relevant error as measured at three different CyberKnife facilities was determined to be mm which did not vary with computed tomographic slice thickness in a range of to mm The average treatment delivery precision was mm Fiducial tracking error was less than mm for radial translations up to 14 mm and less than mm for rotations up to the treatment of relatively stationary spinal lesions targeted with fiducial tracking the CyberKnife system is capable of submillimeter accuracy View details

Respiratory motion is difficult to compensate for with conventional radiotherapy systems An accurate tracking method for following the motion of the tumor is of considerable clinical relevance We investigate methods to compensate for respiratory motion using robotic radiosurgery In this system the therapeutic beam is moved by a robotic arm and follows the moving target through a combination of infrared tracking and synchronized imaging Infrared emitters are used to record the motion of the patient skin surface The position of internal gold fiducials is computed repeatedly during treatment via image processing We correlate the motion between external and internal markers From this correlation model we infer the placement of the internal target during time intervals where no images are taken Fifteen patients with lung tumors have recently been treated with a fully integrated system implementing this new method The clinical trials confirm our hypothesis that internal motion and external motion are indeed correlated In a preliminar study we have extended our work to tracking without implanted fiducials based on algorithms for computing deformation motions and digitally

average using orthogonal amorphous silicon cameras and an image registration process that determined all six degrees of freedom in the target position The change in position from one measurement to the next was indicative of patient treatment site position along each axis of translation was observed to vary by an average of mm for the cranium mm for the cervical spine mm for the lumbar and thoracic spine mm for the lung and mm for the pancreas Half of all cranial cases showed systematic drifting of the target away from the initial setup noninvasive restraints and supports movement of

verification and tracking during delivery of conformal stereotactic radiotherapy Inverse planning with the CyberKnife is used to design a course of radiotherapy for localized prostate cancer Fiducial markers within the gland are used to verify organ position and track organ motion via an orthogonal pair of electronic imaging devices and provide feedback correction to the robotic arm during delivery Conformal isodose curves and dose volume histograms DVH are used to compare with an optimized Radiotherapy IMRT plan actually delivered to the study patient based upon CT organ volumes The CyberKnife can produce superior DVHs for sparing of rectum and bladder and excellent DVHs for target coverage compared with IMRT and possesses dose heterogeneities to the same degree as IMRT plans Because of the significantly longer delivery times required it would be best suited for regimens Such dose regimens might allow for biologically equivalent dose escalation without increased normal tissue toxicity Since the CyberKnife can verify organ position and motion and correct for this in it is the ideal means of achieving such excellent DVHs without a compromise in doses to normal tissues

NEUROSURGERY Ryu Chang Kim MURPHY Le Martin Adler 2001 49 4 Abstract This article demonstrates the technical feasibility of noninvasive treatment of unresectable spinal vascular malformations and primary and metastatic spinal tumors by use of frameless stereotactic radiosurgery delivers a high dose of radiation to a tumor volume or vascular malformation in a limited number of fractions and minimizes the dose to adjacent normal structures Frameless radiosurgery was developed by coupling an orthogonal pair of cameras to a dynamically manipulated linear accelerator that guides the therapy beam to treatment sites within the spine or spinal cord in an outpatient setting and without the use of fixation The system relies on skeletal landmarks or implanted fiducial markers to locate treatment targets Sixteen patients with spinal lesions hemangioblastomas vascular malformations metastatic carcinomas schwannomas a meningioma and a chordoma were treated with total treatment doses of 1100 to 2500 cGy in one to five fractions by use of frameless radiosurgery with the CyberKnife system Accuray Sunnyvale CA Thirteen radiosurgery plans were analyzed for compliance with conventional radiation demonstrated alignment of the treatment dose with the target volume within mm by use of spine fiducials and the CyberKnife treatment planning system Tumor patients with at least 6 months of

field of stereotactic radiosurgery is rapidly advancing as a result of both improvements in radiosurgical equipment and better physician understanding of the clinical applications of stereotactic radiosurgery This article will review recent developments in the field of radiosurgery including advances in our understanding of the treatment of brain metastases and arteriovenous malformations as well as the use of stereotactic radiosurgery as a boost following conventional radiation for nasopharyngeal carcinoma to minimize the rate of local recurrence In addition improved understanding of the radiobiology of normal neurologic structures adjacent to tumors undergoing radiosurgery has led to the use of fractionated stereotactic radiosurgery for the treatment of acoustic neuromas and tumors bordering the anterior visual pathways Finally a breakthrough in radiosurgery involving the development and use of frameless stereotactic radiosurgery has allowed for both dose homogeneity and treatment of intracranial lesions based on nonisocentric treatment algorithms that result in improved target conformality This same frameless radiosurgical system has also expanded the scope of

review which averaged 4 years range years Over the course of follow up one chordoma 10 was smaller in size seven were stable and two chordomas progressed one in a patient who underwent reoperation and a second course of stereotactic radiosurgery and the second in a patient who underwent reoperation alone There were no new neurological deficits noted following radiosurgery in the eight of 10

respiration The ability of conventional radiation therapy systems to compensate for respiratory motion by moving the radiation source is inherently limited Since safety margins currently used in radiation therapy increase the radiation dose by a very large amount an accurate tracking method for following the motion of the tumor is of the utmost clinical relevance We investigate methods to compensate for respiratory motion using robotic radiosurgery Thus the therapeutic beam is moved by a robotic arm and follows the moving target tumor To determine the precise position of the moving target we combine infrared tracking with synchronized imaging Infrared emitters are used to record the motion of the patient skin surface A stereo imaging system provides information about the location of internal markers During an initialization phase prior to treatment the correlation between the motions observed by the two sensors imaging and infrared tracking is computed This model is also continuously updated during treatment to compensate for other motion Experiments and clinical trials suggest that methods can substantially reduce the safety margins currently needed in radiation

population has a poor prognosis when compared with those harboring a solitary brain metastasis and historically treatment has generally consisted of administering radiotherapy once the diagnosis of multiple brain metastases is made Resection can be useful in a subset of patients with multiple metastases in whom one or two of the lesions are symptomatic as this may provide rapid reduction of mass effect and edema Furthermore the authors of recent studies have shown that stereotactic radiosurgery can be used in certain patients with multiple brain metastases as part of the treatment regimen In

Abstract Stereotactic radiosurgery is a minimally invasive procedure that uses a focused beam of radiation as an ablative instrument to destroy brain tumors To deposit a high dose of radiation in a tumor while reducing the dose to healthy tissue a large number of beams are crossfired at the tumor from multiple directions The treatment planning problem also called the inverse dosimetry problem is to compute a set of beams that produces the desired dose distribution So far its investigation has focused on the generation of treatments in which the beam axes intersect at a common point the isocenter However this restriction limits the applicability of the treatments to tumors which have simple shapes This paper describes CARABEAMER a new treatment planner for a radiosurgical system in which the radiation source can be arbitrarily positioned and oriented by a manipulator This planner uses randomized techniques to guess a promising initial set of beams It then applies space partitioning and linear programming techniques to compute the energy to be delivered along each beam Finally it exploits the results of the linear program to iteratively adapt and improve the beam set Experimental results obtained with CARABEAMER on both patient and synthetic cases are presented and discussed These results demonstrate that a radiosurgical system with general kinematics can deliver treatments in which the region receiving a high dose closely matches the shape of the tumor even in complicated cases They also suggest new research directions which are discussed at the end of the

inferior petrosal sinus is the usual route of access both surgical and transfemoral superior ophthalmic vein approaches are also well described In the case presented the anatomy of the CCF was unfavorable for these approaches and its dominant venous egress was via a single enlarged arterialized cortical vein The cavernous sinus was accessed with a transfemoral retrograde approach to the

design and performance of a novel frameless system for radiosurgery This technology called radiosurgery IGR eliminates the need for stereotactic frame fixation by relating the identified lesion to radiographic landmarks CONCEPT IGR uses a lightweight linear accelerator robotic arm Fanuc manipulator Fanuc Robotics North America Rochester Hills MI paired orthogonal imagers and a computer workstation that performs rapid registration During radiosurgery the imaging system determines the location of the lesion and communicates these coordinates to the robot which adjusts the pointing of the linear accelerator beam to maintain alignment with the target RATIONALE Existing stereotactic techniques require rigid cranial fixation to establish and maintain a system of reference for targeting Such frames cause pain for the patient limit the use of fractionation and necessitate a prolonged period of general anesthesia if children are to be treated Furthermore skeletal or any other type of rigid fixation is difficult to achieve beyond the cranium IGR was designed to overcome these limitations which are inherent to nearly all current radiosurgical methods DISCUSSION Preliminary testing and early clinical experience have demonstrated the practicality and potential of the IGR concept and have identified the most important directions for improvement For example an IGR prototype accurately tracked target displacements in three dimensions but showed reduced accuracy when confronted by rotational movements This observation led to development of a new generation of tracking algorithm that promises to improve tracking in all six dimensions Further experience indicated that improvements in the quality of the images were needed to allow the system to locate and treat target sites outside the cranium Consequently a new imaging technology with superior resolution and increased sensitivity has been added to the system These improvements should make it possible to apply IGR techniques to a variety of targets located throughout the body This article describes and critiques the components of the IGR and summarizes our preliminary clinical experience View details for

tumor has reduced proliferative potential The monoclonal antibodies and were used as markers for proliferation The experimental group consisted of pathological specimens obtained from five patients in whom brain metastasis previously had been treated with radiosurgery Pathological specimens obtained from 10 patients with brain metastases matched in histology to diseases in the experimental group but untreated by radiosurgery served as controls A significant decrease in proliferative indices was observed in metastatic brain cancers after radiosurgery p These results indicate that the

March 1989 and December 1993 120 consecutive patients underwent linear stereotaxic radiosurgery for brain metastases identified by computed tomography CT or magnetic resonance imaging MRI scans The influence of various clinical factors on outcome was assessed using plots of survival from the date of radiosurgery and univariate and multivariate median survival time was 32 weeks Progressive brain metastases both local and regional caused 25 of 104 deaths Patients with two metastases n 30 or a solitary metastasis n 70 had equivalent actuarial survival times P median 37 weeks maximum weeks Patients treated to three or more metastases n 20 had significantly shorter survival times P median 14 weeks maximum 63 weeks Prognostic factors associated with prolonged survival included a pretreatment Karnofsky performance status or 70 and fewer than three metastases Delayed radiation necrosis at the treated site developed in 20 patients and correlated with prior or concurrent delivery of irradiation and the logarithm of the tumor duration is equivalent for patients with one or two brain metastases and is similar to that reported for patients with a solitary metastasis managed by

Napel 1995 34 1 Abstract We present a method to correct the geometric distortion caused by field inhomogeneity in MR images of patients wearing stereotaxic frames Our previously published distortion correction method derives error maps by computing the of 3D images acquired at different TEs The time difference delta TE ms at T is chosen such that the water and fat signals are in phase However delta TE is long enough to permit phase wraps in the difference images for frequency offsets greater than 205 Hz Phase unwrapping techniques resolve these only for connected structures therefore the phase difference for fiducial rods may be off by multiples of 2 pi relative to the head We remove this uncertainty by using an additional single 2D image with delta TE 1 ms during which time no are typically expected to determine the correct multiple of 2 pi for each rod We tested our method in a cadaver and in a patient using CT as the gold standard Targets in the frame coordinates were chosen from CT and compared with their locations in Localizing errors using MR compared with CT were as large as mm before correction and were reduced to less than mm after correction View details for Web of

CT and MR images Also described is a new semiautomatic system for registering and visualizing CT and MR images The registration error of the system was determined using a reference data set that was obtained from a cadaver in which rigid fiducial tubes were inserted prior to imaging Registration error was measured as the distance between an analytic expression for each fiducial tube in one image set and transformed samples of the corresponding tube obtained from the other Registration was accomplished by first identifying surfaces of similar anatomic structures in each image set A transformation that best registered these structures was determined using a nonlinear optimization procedure Even though the rms distance at the registered surfaces was similar to that reported by other groups it was found that rms distances for the tubes were significantly larger than the final rms distances between the registered surfaces It was also found that minimizing rms distance at the surface did not minimize rms distance for the tubes View details for Web of Science ID A1995RK26900003 View details for PubMedID 7565379 Method for correcting magnetic resonance image distortion for

FAILURE OF INTRACISTERNAL ACTIVATOR TO PREVENT VASOSPASM IN CERTAIN PATIENTS WITH ANEURYSMAL SUBARACHNOID HEMORRHAGE NEUROSURGERY Steinberg Vanefsky Marks Adler KOENIG 1994 34 5 Abstract Recent experimental and clinical reports suggest that the intracisternal administration of recombinant tissue plasminogen activator tPA within 72 hours of subarachnoid hemorrhage decreases the incidence of severe angiographic and clinical vasospasm In this report we present four of eight patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage who developed angiographic and clinical vasospasm with delayed neurological deterioration despite the use of intracisternal tPA after early aneurysm clipping One patient did not clear her massive subarachnoid hemorrhage with tPA one patient had extremely poor collateral flow with occlusion of one cervical internal carotid artery and 80 stenosis of the other cervical internal carotid artery the other two patients had a subarachnoid hemorrhage 7 to 12 days after their sentinel hemorrhage Three patients ultimately made excellent or good recoveries and one was left with hemiparesis The four other patients treated by this protocol did not develop vasospasm We conclude that intracisternal tPA may not prevent vasospasm in certain patients This may relate to inadequate clearing of the subarachnoid clot poor collateral supply or the occurrence of prior

since the surgical removal of recurrent and multifocal tumors can be associated with greater risks stereotaxic radiosurgery was used to ablate hemangioblastomas in four patients with von disease In two of these cases a symptomatic lesion was surgically resected just prior to radiosurgery The 11 radiosurgically treated tumors four patients were spherical and varied in diameter from to cm with a mean of cm Dose ranged from 30 to 75 Gy with a mean of 35 Gy After a mean clinical and radiologic of greater than 1 years tumor size cyst formation was controlled in all cases Nevertheless it was necessary to temporarily shunt a tumor cyst in one patient In another case aggressive treatment resulted in symptomatic radiation necrosis Despite such potential problems we believe that radiosurgical tumor ablation is a reasonable alternative to craniotomy radiation therapy in poor risk patients This report is believed to be the first published description of the use of radiosurgery in the

Sumanaweera Glover Binford Adler 1993 12 2 Abstract The authors present a new in vivo method to correct the nonlinear and spatial distortion in magnetic resonance MR images caused by magnetic susceptibility variations This distortion across the interface before and after the correction is quantified using a phantom The results are compared to the computed tomography CT images of the same phantom by fusing CT and MR images using fiducials with a registration accuracy of better than a millimeter The distortion at the boundary is negligible compared to the typical MRI MR imaging resolution of 1 mm while that at the boundary creates displacements of about 2 mm for G x This is a significant value if MRI is to provide highly accurate geometric measurements as in the case of target localization for stereotaxic surgery The correction scheme provides MR images with accuracy similar to that of CT 1 mm A new method to estimate the magnetic susceptibility of materials from MR images is presented The magnetic susceptibility of cortical bone is measured using a SQUID magnetometer and is found to be ppm with respect to air which is quite similar to that of tissue ppm View

Silverberg 1992 30 3 Abstract We describe the use of stereotactic angiographic guidance for localization and clipping of a small distal intracranial bacterial aneurysm The technique uses the commercially available angiographic localizer with the widely used stereotactic system This method is simple and easy to use and significantly decreased the operative time It may be quite useful for surgically treating mycotic and other peripheral aneurysms View details for PubMedID 1620306 STEREOTAXIC RADIOSURGICAL TREATMENT OF BRAIN METASTASES JOURNAL OF NEUROSURGERY Adler Cox Kaplan Martin 1992 76 3 Abstract In a series of 33 patients with reasonably controlled primary cancers stereotactic radiosurgery was used to treat 52 brain metastases After a mean radiological time of months six lesions 12 had stabilized in size 26 50 were significantly reduced and 15 29 had disappeared One large melanoma metastasis progressed relentlessly despite treatment Five lesions 9 had decreased in size slightly before enlarging In two of these lesions biopsy revealed only necrosis In almost all cases treatment was associated with decreased peritumoral edema However a group of patients with large metastases and extensive prior brain irradiation has been identified in whom prolonged symptomatic cerebral edema poses a problem It is concluded that radiosurgery is a viable alternative to surgical resection for some cases of brain metastasis View details for Web of Science ID A1992HF27400009 View details for PubMedID 1738025 STEREOTAXIC RADIOSURGERY FOR BRAIN METASTASES THE IMPORTANCE OF ADJUANT WHOLE BRAIN IRRADIATION INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RADIATION ONCOLOGY BIOLOGY PHYSICS Fuller Kaplan Adler Cox Bagshaw A 1992 23 2 Abstract Stereotaxic radiosurgery delivered from a modified 4 MV linear accelerator was used to treat 47 brain metastases in 27 patients at Stanford Response was assessed in 41 lesions Histopathologies included adenocarcinoma 24 lesions renal cell carcinoma 9 lesions melanoma 6 lesions and squamous cell carcinoma 2 lesions ranged from months with a median of months Radiographic local control was achieved in 88 of the lesions Three patients developed enlarging lesions in the radiosurgical field one of these was biopsied and revealed necrosis with no viable tumor Adjuvant whole brain irradiation 10 patients was associated with regional intracranial control in 80 of patients This was statistically superior p to the regional intracranial control rate achieved when radiosurgery alone was employed 6 patients Most patients reported resolution of their neurologic symptoms and were able to discontinue dexamethasone without impairment of neurologic function View details for Web of Science ID A1992HW22500023 View details for PubMedID 1375218 MR

consecutive patients who underwent surgery for intractable extratemporal seizures originating in childhood are described Candidates for surgery were selected on the basis of clinical criteria neurodiagnostic imaging and an electroencephalographic investigation that included the use of sphenoidal electrodes and monitoring Invasive preoperative monitoring was not used Our results with respect to the control of seizures and behavioral improvement are comparable with series in which data from invasive recordings were used in the selection process percent of the 35 patients of those operated on after the introduction of electroencephalographic monitoring became either seizure free or experienced a reduction in their frequency of seizures by at least 75 The favorable outcome in this group of patients strengthens the argument for early operation in children with intractable epilepsy even when the seizure focus is outside the temporal lobe View details for Web of Science ID

1990 82 16 Abstract Clinical observations and experimental work suggested that inflammatory cells attracted to the brain exert a nonspecific antineoplastic effect Intralesional treatment of implanted malignant murine brain tumors KHT sarcomas with killed Corynebacterium parvum produced an inflammatory cell infiltrate and increased survival in C3H mice relative to that in untreated control C3H mice This antitumor effect was enhanced when recombinant was sequentially added as a second intralesional immunomodifier A high percentage of mice so treated were cured Inflammatory cells in the brains of treated mice divided for weeks and metabolic activity of astrocytes increased These findings form the basis for a recently initiated immunotherapy protocol in patients with recurrent glioblastoma

AND A POSSIBLE ROLE IN IN NEONATAL BRAIN ZEITSCHRIFT FUR IN INFANCY AND CHILDHOOD Lorenzo Winston Welch Adler Granholm 1983 38 Abstract Tissue dehydration including that of the brain is a natural part of maturation In the newborn it is accompanied by an acute salt water diuresis which is particularly pronounced in the premature infant The decrease in cranial volume and fall in intracranial pressure to subatmospheric levels observed in premature infants after birth suggests that the brain shares in this process Since fluid homeostasis is normally under hormonal control the inordinate loss of fluid in the prematurely born may be attributable to a hormonal imbalance The possibility that prolactin a proven osmoregulatory hormone in submammalian species but not in mammals and primates may have an important role in this process is suggested by recent evidence that prolactin regulates tissue water in fetal and newborn animals If this hormone assists in the regulation of water and electrolyte content of the brain during the perinatal period then prolactin receptors might be expected at and barriers Our study with preterm term and adult rabbits indicates that prolactin receptors are present and in much higher concentrations in the choroid plexus than in other tissues examined Specific binding of prolactin to receptors on tissues normally is observed to increase with age Since binding to the choroid plexus decreased with age it would suggest that the effect of prolactin on choroid plexus function may be more important during the perinatal than later stages of development
