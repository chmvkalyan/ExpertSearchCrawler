difficult to find robust brain structural correlates of the overall severity of major depressive disorder MDD We hypothesized that specific symptoms may better reveal correlates and investigated this for the severity of insomnia both a key symptom and a modifiable major risk factor of MDD Cortical thickness surface area and subcortical volumes were assessed from brain magnetic resonance imaging MRI scans of 1053 MDD patients age range years from 15 cohorts within the ENIGMA MDD Working Group Insomnia severity was measured by summing the insomnia items of the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale HDRS Symptom specificity was evaluated with correlates of overall depression severity Disease specificity was evaluated in two independent samples comprising 2108 healthy controls and in 260 clinical controls with bipolar disorder Results showed that MDD patients with more severe insomnia had a smaller cortical surface area mostly driven by the right insula left inferior frontal gyrus pars triangularis left frontal pole right superior parietal cortex right medial orbitofrontal cortex and right supramarginal gyrus Associations were specific for insomnia severity and were not found for overall depression severity Associations were also specific to MDD healthy controls and clinical controls showed differential insomnia severity association profiles The findings indicate that MDD patients with more severe insomnia show smaller surfaces in several frontoparietal cortical areas While explained variance remains small associations could bring us closer to clues on underlying biological phenomena of MDD View details for DOI View details for PubMedID 33293520 Naturalistic Language Input is Associated with Functional Connectivity in Infancy The Journal of neuroscience the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience King Camacho Montez Humphreys Gotlib 2020 Abstract The quantity and quality of the language input that infants receive from their caregivers affects their future language abilities however it is unclear how variation in this input relates to preverbal brain circuitry The current study investigated the relation between naturalistic language input and the functional connectivity of language networks in human infancy using functional magnetic resonance imaging rsfMRI We recorded the naturalistic language environments of to male and female infants using the Linguistic Environment Analysis LENA system and measured the quantity and consistency of their exposure to adult words and conversational turns Infants completed an rsfMRI scan during natural sleep and we examined functional connectivity among regions of interest previously implicated in language comprehension including the auditory cortex the left inferior frontal gyrus IFG and the bilateral superior temporal gyrus STG Consistent with theory of the ontogeny of the cortical language network Skeide and Friederici 2016 we identified two subnetworks posited to have distinct developmental trajectories a posterior temporal network involving connections of the auditory cortex and bilateral STG and a frontotemporal network involving connections of the left IFG Independent of socioeconomic status the quantity of conversational turns was uniquely associated with functional connectivity of these networks Infants who engaged in a larger number of conversational turns in daily life had lower connectivity in the posterior temporal language network These results provide evidence for the role of vocal interactions with caregivers compared to overheard adult speech in the function of language networks in STATEMENT Infants whose caregivers speak to them more develop better language skills It is unclear however how language input is associated with preverbal brain circuitry functional magnetic resonance imaging during natural sleep can noninvasively measure patterns of brain activation in infancy The present study finds that the quantity of vocal interactions infants engage in with their caregivers in daily life correlates with the strength of functional connectivity in regions of the brain implicated in language comprehension These results provide evidence for the role of vocal interactions with caregivers in the function of language networks in infancy Interventions that focus on increasing vocal interactions may be associated with infant brain function in a manner that ultimately enhances language abilities View details for DOI View details for PubMedID 33257324 Study Protocol for Teen Inflammation Glutamate Emotion Research TIGER

to examine this possibility in a convenience sample of 124 women years years White Asian who provided of attachment style during pregnancy using the Attachment Style Questionnaire of whom 96 years years White Asian were reassessed when their child was years Women on their own childhood maltreatment severity and their child current emotional and behavioral problems using the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire and the Child Behavior Checklist for ages respectively Maternal childhood maltreatment severity was associated with less secure and more avoidant and anxious attachment Mediation analyses revealed further that less secure maternal attachment but not avoidant or anxious attachment mediated the associations between maternal childhood maltreatment and offspring emotional and behavioral problems These findings suggest that improving maternal attachment security which can be identified even prior to the child birth is an important target to consider for intervention efforts

Gotlib 2020 294 113399 Abstract Although many investigators have examined symptoms of major depressive disorder MDD the multivariate relations among these features of depression and their relative associations with overall severity of depression are not well understood The present study is the first to examine the underlying factor structure of depression across a broad set of constructs and to model the multivariate association of these factors with the overall severity of depression We conducted a factor analysis and multiple regression in a sample of participants diagnosed with MDD and healthy controls We obtained a solution composed of the following factors 1 anxiety 2 behavioral activation 3 core symptoms 4 rumination and 5 emotional intensity The core symptoms factor composed primarily of diagnostic criteria for MDD was the only factor that showed a consistent significant association with overall severity of depression and functional impairment Rumination combined with behavioral inhibition and positive and negative affect combined with each other to form coherent constructs that may be useful in examining differences among depressed individuals These findings provide an important framework for the multidimensional symptom structure of depression and suggest several actionable ways for improving clinical assessment and treatment for individuals with MDD

socioemotional domains Most previous investigations of the association between childhood socioeconomic status and brain morphology have used designs with samples that span wide age ranges occluding effects specific to adolescence Sex differences in the association between socioeconomic status and neurodevelopment may emerge or intensify during adolescence In a sample representative of the San Francisco Bay Area we used morphometry to examine sex differences in the association between variation in family ratio INR and cortical and subcortical gray and white matter volume during early adolescence ages years N 147 as well as in the longitudinal association between INR and change in volume from early to later adolescence ages years N 109 Biological sex interacted with INR to explain variation in volume in several areas and longitudinally Effects were primarily in cortical gray matter areas including regions of the association cortex and sensorimotor processing areas Effect sizes tended to be larger in boys than in girls Biological sex may be an important variable to consider in analyses of the effects of family income on structural neurodevelopment during adolescence View

advanced brain aging in adult MDD patients and whether this process is associated with clinical characteristics in a large multicenter international dataset We performed a by pooling brain measures derived from MRI scans from 19 samples worldwide Healthy brain aging was estimated by predicting chronological age years from 7 subcortical volumes 34 cortical thickness and 34 surface area lateral ventricles and total intracranial volume measures separately in 952 male and 1236 female controls from the ENIGMA MDD working group The learned model coefficients were applied to 927 male controls and 986 depressed males and 1199 female controls and 1689 depressed females to obtain independent unbiased age predictions The difference between predicted brain age and chronological age was calculated to indicate age difference On average MDD patients showed a higher of SE years Cohen 95 CI compared with controls However this difference did not seem to be driven by specific clinical characteristics recurrent status remission status antidepressant medication use age of onset or symptom severity This highly powered collaborative effort showed subtle patterns of structural brain abnormalities in MDD Substantial variance and overlap between groups were observed Longitudinal studies of MDD and somatic health outcomes are needed to further assess the clinical value of these estimates View

brain development in white matter WM that is attributed in part to surges in gonadal hormones To date however there have been few longitudinal investigations relating changes in gonadal hormones and WM development in adolescents We acquired MRI to estimate mean fractional anisotropy FA from 10 WM tracts and salivary testosterone from 51 females and 29 males ages years who were matched on pubertal stage and followed on average for 2 years We tested whether interactions between sex and changes in testosterone levels significantly explained changes in FA We found positive associations between changes in testosterone and changes in FA within the corpus callosum cingulum cingulate and corticospinal tract in females all ps corrected and associations in males We also collected salivary estradiol from females and found that increases in estradiol were associated with increases in FA in the left uncinate fasciculus uncorrected however this effect was no longer significant after accounting for changes in testosterone Our findings indicate there are sex differences in how changes in testosterone relate to changes in WM microstructure of tracts that support impulse control and

lower thickness and surface area in the CA1 of the hippocampus and the basolateral amygdala Cohen d to Our results suggest that previously reported volumetric differences may be localized to specific

Psychoneuroendocrinology King Graber Colich Gotlib 2020 115 104651 Abstract Atypical regulation of the HPA axis is a putative mechanism underlying the association between exposure to early life stress ELS and the subsequent development of mental and physical health difficulties Recent research indicates that puberty is a period of plasticity during which the effects of exposure to ELS on cortisol regulation may change In particular increases in the sex hormones that drive pubertal maturation including dehydroepiandrosterone DHEA and testosterone may be implicated in pubertal recalibration of cortisol regulation In the current study we examined the associations among levels of ELS and salivary waking cortisol DHEA and testosterone in a sample of 178 adolescents 55 female who were in early puberty at baseline Tanner stages mean Tanner stage SD mean age SD and were followed up approximately two years later mean Tanner stage SD mean age SD Using modeling we disaggregated the effects of levels and increases in pubertal stage and sex hormones on change in cortisol Controlling for differences in average pubertal stage the association between levels of cortisol and DHEA was more strongly positive among adolescents who evidenced greater increases in pubertal stage across time Both higher average levels and greater increases in DHEA and testosterone were associated with increases in cortisol across time indicating positive coupling of developmental changes in these hormones however coupling was attenuated in adolescents who were exposed to more severe ELS prior to puberty These findings advance our understanding of the development of the and its association with childhood environmental risk during puberty View details for DOI View details for PubMedID 32199287 The human connectome project for disordered emotional states Protocol and rationale for a research domain criteria study of brain connectivity in young adult anxiety and depression NeuroImage Tozzi Staveland Chesnut Chang Choi Shiner Wu Sporns Barch Gotlib Hastie Kerr A Poldrack Wandell B Wintermark Williams 2020 116715 Abstract Through the Human Connectome Project HCP our understanding of the functional connectome of the healthy brain has been dramatically accelerated Given the pressing public health need we must increase our understanding of how connectome dysfunctions give rise to disordered mental states Mental disorders arising from high levels of negative emotion or from the loss of positive emotional experience affect over 400 million people globally Such states of disordered emotion cut across multiple diagnostic categories of mood and anxiety disorders and are compounded by accompanying disruptions in cognitive function Not surprisingly these forms of psychopathology are the leading cause of disability worldwide The Research Domain Criteria RDoC initiative spearheaded by NIMH offers a framework for characterizing the relations among connectome dysfunctions anchored in neural circuits and phenotypic profiles of behavior and symptoms Here we report on our Connectomes Related to Human Disease protocol for integrating an RDoC framework with HCP protocols to characterize connectome dysfunctions in disordered emotional states and present quality control data from a representative sample of participants We focus on three RDoC domains and constructs most relevant to depression and anxiety 1 loss and acute threat within the Negative Valence System NVS domain 2 reward valuation and responsiveness within the Positive Valence System PVS domain and 3 working memory and cognitive control within the Cognitive System CS domain For 29 healthy controls we present preliminary imaging data functional magnetic resonance imaging collected in the resting state and in tasks matching our constructs of interest Emotion Gambling and Continuous Performance tasks as well as imaging All functional scans demonstrated good ratio Established neural networks were robustly identified in the resting state condition by independent component analysis Processing of negative emotional faces significantly activated the bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal and occipital cortices fusiform gyrus and amygdalae Reward elicited a response in the bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal parietal and occipital cortices and in the striatum Working memory was associated with activation in the dorsolateral prefrontal parietal motor temporal and insular cortices in the striatum and cerebellum Diffusion tractography showed consistent profiles of fractional anisotropy along known white matter tracts We also show that results are comparable to those in a matched sample from the HCP Healthy Young Adult data release These preliminary data provide the foundation for acquisition of 250 subjects who are experiencing disordered emotional states When complete these data will be used to develop a neurobiological model that maps connectome dysfunctions

emotional abuse physical abuse sexual abuse emotional neglect and physical neglect and depression using a We found that higher child maltreatment scores were associated with a diagnosis of depression g 95 CI and with higher depression symptom scores Z 95 CI Moreover although each type of child maltreatment was positively associated with depression diagnosis and scores there was variability in the size of the effects with emotional abuse and emotional neglect demonstrating the strongest These analyses provide important evidence of the link between child maltreatment and depression and highlight

adversity provide evidence for role transition in the pathogenesis of perinatal depression Translational psychiatry Robakis Zhang Rasgon Li Wang Roth Humphreys Gotlib Ho Khechaduri Watson Budhan Davis Crowe Ellie Williams Urban 2020 10 1 48 Abstract Early life adversity and insecure attachment style are known risk factors for perinatal depression The biological pathways linking these experiences however have not yet been elucidated We hypothesized that overlap in patterns of DNA methylation in association with each of these phenomena could identify genes and pathways of importance Specifically we wished to distinguish between and hypotheses of perinatal depression We conducted a analysis of methylation patterns across 5 106 individual CG dinucleotides in 54 women participating in a longitudinal prospective study of perinatal depression using criteria for significance to control for multiple comparisons We identified 1580 regions in which methylation density was associated with childhood adversity 3 in which methylation density was associated with insecure attachment style and 6 in which methylation density was associated with perinatal depression Shorter telomeres were observed in association with childhood trauma but not with perinatal depression or attachment insecurity A detailed analysis of methylation density in the oxytocin receptor gene revealed similar patterns of DNA methylation in association with perinatal depression and with insecure attachment style while childhood trauma was associated with a distinct methylation pattern in this gene Clinically attachment style was strongly associated with depression only in pregnancy and the early postpartum whereas the association of childhood adversity with depression was We concluded that the broad DNA methylation signature and reduced telomere length associated with childhood adversity could indicate increased allostatic load across multiple body systems whereas perinatal depression and attachment insecurity may be narrower phenotypes with more limited DNA methylation signatures outside the CNS and no apparent association with telomere length or by extension allostatic load In contrast the finding of matching DNA methylation patterns within the oxytocin receptor gene for perinatal depression and attachment insecurity is consistent with the theory that the perinatal period is a time of activation of existing attachment schemas for the purpose of structuring the relationship and that such activation may occur in part through specific patterns of methylation of the oxytocin receptor gene View details for DOI View details for PubMedID 32066670 The role of affective control in emotion regulation during adolescence Emotion Washington Schweizer Gotlib Blakemore 2020 20 1 Abstract In this review we evaluate evidence for the hypothesis that developmental changes in emotion regulation tendencies during adolescence depend on the maturation of affective control Affective control refers to the application of cognitive control to affective contexts that is the capacity to attend and respond to affective information while inhibiting attention and responses toward distracting affective information The evidence suggests that affective control develops throughout adolescence into adulthood However the developmental trajectory appears not to be uniform across different facets of affective control In particular the capacity to inhibit attention and responses to distracting affective information may be reduced during adolescence relative to childhood and adulthood Focusing on the association between affective control and emotion regulation development in adolescence the research reviewed supports the notion of affective control as a cognitive building block of successful emotion regulation Good affective control appears related to fewer ruminative tendencies in adolescence as well as more frequent and successful reappraisal in older adolescents Lower use of habitual suppression itself a type of affective inhibition shows an association with updating capacity We conclude by discussing the implications of these findings for mental health and the potential mental health benefits associated with improving affective control PsycINFO Database Record c 2020 APA all rights reserved View details for DOI View details for PubMedID

identify processes that contribute to the maintenance of depressive episodes Difficulty removing negative information from working memory WM is posited to exacerbate affective cognitive and biological dysregulation in Major Depressive Disorder MDD but this has not yet been tested In this study we examined whether training depressed individuals to remove negative information from WM RNI training would reduce symptoms of depression and levels of rumination and would be associated with attenuated biological responsivity to stress Individuals diagnosed with MDD were randomly assigned to complete training or training for six Across conditions participants exhibited significant improvements from to in removing negative information from WM symptoms of depression and rumination Furthermore participants in the condition showed a more attenuated pattern of cortisol and respiratory sinus arrhythmia RSA responses to stress than did participants in the training We did not assess the effects of training It will be important for future research to examine whether the documented effects persist across This study is the first to examine the effects of RNI training on clinical symptoms and biological responses to stress in MDD and it provides experimental evidence that training individuals with depression to remove negative information from WM can help to modulate the heightened

however are not well understood During puberty a drastic neuroendocrine shift signals physical changes resulting in robust sex differences in human physiology Here we explore how shifting patterns of DNA methylation may inform these pathways of biological plasticity during the pubertal transition In this study we analyzed DNA methylation DNAm in saliva at two time points across the pubertal transition within the same individuals Our purpose was to compare two domains of DNAm patterns that may inform processes of sexual differentiation 1 sex related sites which demonstrated differences between males from females and 2 time related sites in which DNAm shifted significantly between timepoints We further explored the correlated network structure sex and time related DNAm networks and linked these patterns to pubertal stage assays of salivary testosterone a reliable diagnostic of free unbound hormone that is available to act on target tissues and overlap with androgen response that differed by biological sex were largely independent of sites that underwent change across puberty DNAm sites but not sites formed correlated networks that were associated with pubertal stage Both time and sex DNAm networks reflected salivary testosterone levels that were enriched for androgen response elements with DNAm networks being informative of testosterone levels above and beyond biological sex later in the pubertal results inform our understanding of the distinction between and differences in DNAm during the critical period of puberty and highlight a novel linkage between correlated

brain regions implicated in cognitive appraisal and emotion regulation is a common characteristic of resilient individuals at high risk for MDD and of individuals with MDD with a favorable illness course Furthermore significant associations between functional connectivity and both positively interpreted stressful life events in resilient individuals and a favorable response to treatments in depressed individuals suggest that changes and plasticity underlie resilience in research has identified putative functional neuroimaging biomarkers of resilience in MDD A continued focus on identifying neurobiological underpinnings of resilience in the context of dynamic environmental and developmental influences on MDD will advance our understanding of resilience in this disorder and

disorder BD major depressive disorder MDD disorder OCD and of group differences in cortical thickness between cases and controls were generated using magnetic resonance images Similarity between interregional profiles of gene expression and those in the group differences in cortical thickness were investigated in each disorder Next principal component analysis was used to reveal a shared profile of group difference in thickness across the disorders Analysis for gene coexpression clustering and enrichment for genes associated with these disorders were conducted Data analysis was conducted between June and December 2019 The analysis included 145 cohorts across 6 psychiatric disorders drawn from the ENIGMA consortium The numbers of cases and controls in each of the 6 disorders were as follows ADHD 1814 and 1602 ASD 1748 and 1770 BD 1547 and 3405 MDD 2658 and 3572 OCD 2266 and 2007 and schizophrenia 2688 and profiles of group difference in cortical thickness between cases and total of 12 721 cases and 15 600 controls ranging from ages 2 to 89 years were included in this study Interregional profiles of group differences in cortical thickness for each of the 6 psychiatric disorders were associated with profiles of gene expression specific to pyramidal CA1 cells astrocytes except for BD and microglia except for OCD collectively profiles of the 3 cell types explain between 25 and 54 of variance in interregional profiles of group differences in cortical thickness Principal component analysis revealed a shared profile of difference in cortical thickness across the 6 disorders 48 variance explained interregional profile of this principal component 1 was associated with that of the gene expression explaining 56 of interregional variation Coexpression analyses of these genes revealed 2 clusters 1 a prenatal cluster enriched with genes involved in neurodevelopmental axon guidance processes and 2 a postnatal cluster enriched with genes involved in synaptic activity and processes These clusters were enriched with genes associated with all 6 psychiatric this study shared neurobiologic processes were associated with differences in cortical thickness across multiple psychiatric disorders These processes implicate a common role of prenatal development and postnatal functioning of the cerebral cortex in these disorders View details for DOI

IAT assessing associations between self and death in a community sample of adolescents Here we sought to replicate these findings in an independent sample of depressed depressed adolescents who varied in severity of suicidal thoughts and behaviors completed structural MRI Caudate putamen and nucleus accumbens GMVs were estimated using FreeSurfer Robust linear regressions were used to examine associations between striatal GMVs and implicit and explicit SI covarying for sex age total intracranial volume medication use and depression severity Significance was determined using Bonferroni

IAT scores all ps Smaller putamen and nucleus accumbens GMVs were not associated with implicit or explicit SI Our LASSO analysis indicated that right caudate GMV contributed most to the prediction of IAT study is the first to demonstrate that caudate GMVs are significantly associated with implicit with death in a sample of depressed adolescents When considered with our previous work smaller

accelerated development is unknown In a sample of young adolescents we examined the relations among ELS frontoamygdala circuitry during viewing of emotional faces cellular aging as measured by telomere shortening and pubertal tempo We found that greater cumulative severity of ELS was associated with stronger negative coupling between bilateral centromedial amygdala and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex a pattern that may reflect more mature connectivity More negative frontoamygdala coupling for distinct amygdala subdivisions was associated with slower telomere shortening and pubertal tempo over 2 years These potentially protective associations of negative frontoamygdala connectivity were most pronounced in adolescents who had been exposed to higher ELS Our findings provide support for the formulation that ELS accelerates maturation of frontoamygdala connectivity and provide novel evidence that this neural circuitry confers protection against accelerated biological aging particularly for adolescents who have experienced higher ELS Although negative frontoamygdala connectivity may be an adaptation to ELS frontoamygdala connectivity cellular aging and

Cerebral Blood Flow in To Regional Tissue Maturity is Associated with Infant Affect Developmental science Camacho King Ojha Garcia Sisk Cichocki Humphreys Gotlib 2019 e12928 Abstract Infancy is marked by rapid neural and emotional development The relation between brain function and emotion in infancy however is not well understood Methods for measuring brain function predominantly rely on the BOLD signal however interpretation of the BOLD signal in infancy is challenging because the relation is immature Regional cerebral blood flow rCBF provides a context for the infant BOLD signal and can yield insight into the developmental maturity of brain regions that may support affective behaviors This study aims to elucidate the relations among rCBF age and emotion in infancy One hundred and seven mothers reported their infants infant age temperament A subsample of infants completed MRI scans of whom produced usable perfusion MRI during natural sleep to quantify rCBF dyads completed the repeated Paradigm from which infant affect reactivity and recovery to stress were quantified We tested associations of infant age at scan temperament factor scores and observed affect reactivity and recovery with rCBF Infant age was positively associated with CBF in nearly all voxels with peaks located in sensory cortices and the ventral prefrontal cortex supporting the formulation that rCBF is an indicator of tissue maturity Temperamental negative affect and recovery of positive affect following a stressor were positively associated with rCBF in several cortical and subcortical limbic regions including the orbitofrontal cortex and inferior frontal gyrus This finding yields insight into the nature of affective neurodevelopment during infancy Specifically infants with relatively increased prefrontal cortex maturity may evidence a disposition toward greater negative affect and negative reactivity in their daily lives yet show better recovery of positive affect following a

associated with an early onset of MDD ie during childhood or adolescence however is not known In this we estimated the associations between ELS and the risk for onset of MDD before age 18 years In addition we examined the associations between eight specific forms of ELS ie sexual abuse physical abuse poverty physical death of a family member domestic violence natural disaster and emotional abuse and risk for We conducted a systematic search in scientific databases for studies that assessed both ELS and the presence or absence of MDD before age 18 years We identified 62 journal articles with a total of unique participants We assessed study quality using the Scale When heterogeneous effect sizes were detected we tested whether demographic methodological factors moderated the association between ELS and Using a we found that individuals who experienced ELS were more likely to develop MDD before the age of 18 than were individuals without a history of ELS 95 CI Separate revealed a range of associations with MDD while some types of ELS eg poverty were not associated with MDD other types eg emotional abuse were associated more strongly with MDD than was ELS considered more These findings provide important evidence that the adverse effect of ELS on MDD risk manifests early in development prior to adulthood and varies by type of ELS View details for DOI View details

brain and it may be altered in several psychiatric conditions MRI studies have shown subtle differences of brain anatomy between people with major depressive disorder and healthy control subjects but few studies have specifically examined brain anatomical asymmetry in relation to this disorder and results from those studies have remained inconclusive At the functional level some electroencephalography studies have indicated left hypoactivity and right parietal hypoactivity in depressive disorders so aspects of lateralized anatomy may also be affected The authors used pooled data from data sets collected around the world to investigate differences in laterality in measures of cortical thickness cortical surface area and subcortical volume between individuals with major depression and healthy control The authors investigated differences in the laterality of thickness and surface area measures of 34 cerebral cortical regions in individuals with major depression and control subjects from 31 separate data sets and they investigated volume asymmetries of eight subcortical structures in individuals with major depression and control subjects from 32 data sets MRI data were processed with a single protocol using FreeSurfer and the atlas The large sample size provided 80 power to detect effects of the order of Cohen The largest effect size Cohen d of major depression diagnosis was for the thickness asymmetry of the superior temporal cortex which was not significant after adjustment for multiple testing Asymmetry measures were not significantly associated with medication use acute compared with remitted status first episode compared with recurrent status or age at Altered brain asymmetry may be of little relevance to major depression

Dennis Humphreys King Thompson Gotlib 2019 Abstract Irritability is garnering increasing attention in psychiatric research as a transdiagnostic marker of both internalizing and externalizing disorders These disorders often emerge during adolescence highlighting the need to examine changes in the brain and in psychological functioning during this developmental period Adolescents were recruited for a longitudinal study examining the effects of early life stress on the development of psychopathology 151 adolescents 73 F average years standard were scanned with a MRI sequence and parents completed reports of adolescent irritability using the Affective Reactivity Index Of these 151 adolescents 94 46 F returned for a second session average years We used morphometry to examine and longitudinal associations between irritability and regional brain volume Irritability was associated with brain volume across a number of regions More irritable individuals had larger hippocampi insula medial orbitofrontal cortex and cortex and smaller putamen and internal capsule Across the brain more irritable individuals also had larger volume and less volume contraction in a number of areas that typically decrease in volume over the developmental period studied here suggesting delayed maturation These structural changes may increase adolescents vulnerability for internalizing and

with Parents Predicts Change in Depressive Symptoms in Adolescents with Major Depressive Disorder Journal of abnormal child psychology Manczak Ordaz Singh Goyer Gotlib 2019 Abstract Research with community samples suggests that features of families such as the amount of time parents and adolescents spend together affect depressive symptoms in adolescents It is possible however that spending time with parents not only protects against the onset of depressive symptoms but also reduces symptoms in adolescents who are already depressed The current study was designed to test this formulation while also examining whether affective dimensions of family functioning specifically parental warmth accounted for or moderated observed associations Finally we tested the reverse direction of the associations examining whether greater severity of depression in adolescents results in parents spending less time with them adolescents ages 14 to 17years who met criteria for a current major depressive episode participated in the present study with one parent Once each month for six time points dyads completed reports of depressive symptoms and the amount of time parents and adolescents spent with each other Participants also completed measures of parental warmth Results of lagged multilevel modeling indicated that spending more time with a parent predicted fewer depressive symptoms in adolescents at the following assessment relative to their mean in contrast greater severity of depressive symptoms did not predict spending less time with a parent at the following assessment In contrast parental warmth did not account for or moderate the association between time together and depressive symptoms These results suggest that dimensions of family life specifically spending more time with parents have beneficial effects on depressive symptoms in adolescents diagnosed with depression View details for PubMedID 30847667 biomarkers of risk and resilience in adolescent depression

functional connectivity FC in anterior cingulate regions subgenual anterior cingulate sgACC and by negative emotional functioning that is inflexible or resistant to MDD N 33 and control CTL N 31 adults completed a scan followed by a Experience Sampling Methodology ESM protocol surveying 10 positive and negative emotions 5 times per day for 21 days We used multilevel modeling to assess emotional inflexibility strong temporal connections between emotions We examined group differences in FC analysis of bilateral sgACC and then examined associations between emotional experiences and the extracted FC values within each As predicted MDDs had inflexibility in sadness and avoidance p p indicating that these emotional experiences persist in depression MDDs showed weaker FC between the right sgACC and anterior cingulate than did CTLs voxelwise Importantly FC predicted sadness inflexibility in both MDDs p and CTLs p suggesting that sgACC FC is associated with negative Other maladaptive behaviors likely also affect the flexibility of negative emotions We can not generalize our finding of a positive relation between sgACC FC and inflexibility of sadness to individuals with more chronic depression or who have recovered from Our preliminary findings suggest that connections between portions of the ACC contribute to the persistence of negative emotions and are important in identifying a brain mechanism that may underlie the maintenance of sadness in daily life View details for PubMedID 30743019 People are Better at Maintaining Positive Than Negative Emotional States EMOTION Waugh Running Reynolds Gotlib 2019 19 1 Abstract Determining how people maintain positive and negative emotional states is critical to understanding emotional dynamics individual differences in emotion and the instrumental value of emotions There has been a surge in interest in tasks assessing affective working memory that can examine how people maintain positive and negative emotional states In these tasks people are asked to maintain their emotional state that was induced by an initial stimulus in order to compare that state with the state induced by a subsequent stimulus It is unclear however whether measures of accuracy in this task actually reflect the success of maintaining the initial emotional state In a series of studies we introduce an idiographic metric of accuracy that reflects the success of emotional maintenance and use that metric to examine whether people are better at maintaining positive or negative emotional states We demonstrate that people are generally better at maintaining positive emotional states than they are at maintaining negative emotional states Studies We also show that this effect is not due to decay or to spontaneous

Puberty a Moderated Mediation Analysis JOURNAL OF ABNORMAL CHILD PSYCHOLOGY LeMoult Humphreys King Colich Price Ordaz Gotlib 2019 47 2 Abstract Despite the high prevalence and substantial costs of early life stress ELS the mechanisms through which ELS confers risk for psychopathology are poorly understood particularly among youth who are in an earlier stage of the transition through puberty We sought to advance our understanding of the link between ELS and psychopathology by testing whether rumination mediates the relation between ELS and symptoms of psychopathology in youth in the early stages of puberty and whether sex moderates this mediation We assessed levels of ELS both brooding and reflection subtypes of rumination and internalizing and externalizing symptoms in 170 youth in the early stages of puberty 56 girls ages years Brooding but not reflection mediated the relation between ELS and both internalizing and externalizing symptoms Importantly however sex moderated the relation among ELS brooding and symptoms Specifically brooding mediated the relation between ELS and both internalizing and externalizing symptoms for girls but not for boys Findings support the formulation that brooding is a mechanism linking ELS to multiple forms of behavioral and emotional problems exclusively in girls in the early stages of puberty View details for PubMedID 29774495 Symptoms of social anxiety disorder and major depressive disorder A network perspective Journal of affective disorders Langer Tonge Piccirillo Rodebaugh Thompson Gotlib 2019 243 Abstract BACKGROUND We used network analyses to examine symptoms that may play a role in the of social anxiety disorder SAD and major depressive disorder MDD Whereas latent variable models examine relations among latent constructs network analyses have the advantage of characterizing direct relations among the symptoms We conducted network modeling on symptoms of social anxiety and depression in a clinical sample of 130 women who met criteria for SAD MDD both disorders or had no lifetime history of mental In the resulting network the core symptoms of social fear and depressed mood appeared at opposite ends of the network and were weakly related bridges between these symptoms appeared to occur via intervening variables In particular the worthless variable appeared to play a central role in the Because our data were we are unable to draw conclusions about the direction of these effects or whether these variables are related to each other Continued testing of these pathways using longitudinal data will help

depression in adolescence the mediating neurobiological mechanisms however are unknown In this study we examined in early pubertal youth the associations among ELS cortisol stress responsivity and white matter microstructure of the uncinate fasciculus and the fornix two key frontolimbic tracts we also tested whether and how these variables predicted depressive symptoms in later puberty A total of 208 participants 117 females M age years M Tanner stage provided data across two or more assessment modalities ELS salivary cortisol levels during a psychosocial stress task diffusion magnetic resonance imaging and depressive symptoms In early puberty there were significant associations between higher ELS and decreased cortisol production and between decreased cortisol production and increased fractional anisotropy in the uncinate fasciculus Further increased fractional anisotropy in the uncinate fasciculus predicted higher depressive symptoms in later puberty above and beyond earlier symptoms In post hoc analyses we found that sex moderated several additional associations We discuss these findings within a broader conceptual model linking ELS emotion dysregulation and depression across the transition through puberty and contend that brain circuits implicated in the control of axis function should be a focus of continued research View details for PubMedID 31064568

sensitivity to reward predicts the onset and course of mania in bipolar disorder the evidence for neural abnormalities in reward processing in bipolar disorder is mixed To probe neural responsiveness to anticipated and received rewards in the context of bipolar disorder we scanned individuals with remitted bipolar I disorder n 24 and controls n 24 matched for age and gender using Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging FMRI during a Monetary Incentive Delay MID task Relative to controls the bipolar group showed reduced NAcc activity during anticipation of gains Across groups this blunting correlated with individual differences in impulsive responses to positive emotions Positive Urgency which statistically accounted for the association of blunted NAcc activity with bipolar diagnosis These results suggest that blunted NAcc responses during gain anticipation in the context of bipolar disorder may reflect individual differences in Positive Urgency These findings may help resolve discrepancies in the literature on neural responses to reward in bipolar disorder and clarify the relationship between brain activity and the propensity to experience manic episodes View details for

saliva samples using the Illumina EPIC chip and examined CpG sites within six key genes NR3C1 NR3C2 CRH CRHR1 CRHR2 FKBP5 alongside 59 genotypes for tagging SNPs capturing cis genetic variability DNAm levels within CpG sites in NR3C1 CRH CRHR1 and CRHR2 were associated with risk for MDD across adolescence and young adulthood To rule out the possibility that findings were merely due to the contribution of genetic variability we the data controlling for cis genetic variation within these candidate genes Importantly methylation levels in these CpG sites continued to significantly predict the onset of MDD suggesting that variation in the epigenome independent of proximal genetic variants prospectively predicts the onset of MDD These findings suggest that variation in the HPA axis at

Camacho Mackey Heilig Drevets Glover Gambhir Gotlib 2018 8 1 264 Abstract Major depressive disorder MDD is characterized by the altered integration of reward histories and reduced responding of the striatum We have posited that this reduced striatal activation in MDD is due to tonically decreased stimulation of striatal dopamine synapses which results in decremented propagation of information along the CSPT spiral In the present investigation we tested predictions of this formulation by conducting concurrent functional magnetic resonance imaging fMRI and positron emission tomography PET in depressed and control CTL participants We scanned 16 depressed and 14 CTL participants with simultaneous fMRI and PET We estimated raclopride binding potential BPND and compared MDD and CTL samples with respect to BPND in the striatum Using striatal regions that showed significant BPND differences as seeds we conducted functional connectivity analysis using the fMRI data and identified brain regions in each group in which connectivity with striatal seed regions scaled linearly with BPND from these regions We observed increased BPND in the ventral striatum bilaterally and in the right dorsal striatum in the depressed participants Further we found that as BPND increased in both the left ventral striatum and right dorsal striatum in MDD connectivity with the cortical targets of these regions network and salience network respectively decreased Deficits in stimulation of striatal dopamine receptors in MDD could account in part for the failure of transfer of information up the CSPT

Humphreys King Sacchet Camacho Colich Ordaz Ho Gotlib 2018 e12775 Abstract Exposure to stress has been causally linked to changes in hippocampal volume HV Given that the hippocampus undergoes rapid changes in the first years of life stressful experiences during this period may be particularly important in understanding individual differences in the development of the hippocampus One hundred early adolescents ages years 43 male were interviewed regarding exposure to and age of onset of experiences of stress the severity of each stressful event was rated by an objective panel All participants underwent structural magnetic resonance imaging from which HVs were automatically segmented Without considering the age of onset for stressful experiences there was a small but statistically significant negative association of stress severity with bilateral HV When considering the age of onset there was a moderate and significant negative association between stress severity during early childhood through age 5 years and HV there was no association between stress severity during later childhood and HV age 6 years and older We provide evidence of a sensitive period through age 5 years for the effects of life stress on HV in adolescence It will be important in future research to elucidate how reduced HV stemming from early life stress may contribute to health outcomes

predict Given that SI begins in adolescence when brain networks are maturing it is important to understand associations between network functioning and changes in severity of depressed adolescents were administered the Severity Rating Scale to assess SI and completed fMRI at baseline T1 and 6 months later T2 We computed coherence in the executive control ECN default mode DMN salience SN and noise networks and then examined the association between changes in brain network coherence and changes in SI severity from T1 to A greater reduction in severity of SI was associated with a stronger increase in SN coherence from T1 to T2 There were no associations between the other networks and We can not generalize our findings to more psychiatrically diverse samples More are necessary to understand the trajectory of SI and SN coherence Our finding that reductions in SI are associated with increases in SN coherence extends previous results documenting a negative association between SI severity and SN coherence The SN is involved in coordinating activation of ECN and DMN in response to salient information Given this regulatory role of the SN the association between SN coherence and SI suggests that adolescents with reduced SN coherence might more easily engage in harmful thoughts Thus the SN may be particularly relevant as a target for treatment applications in depressed

International Study to Predict Optimized Treatment in Depression in patients with current nonpsychotic MDD 722 completers had three arms escitalopram sertraline and release At pretreatment patients were defined as having anxious versus nonanxious depression and their resting HRV root mean square of successive differences was assessed Patients usual treating clinicians managed medication At 8weeks primary outcomes were depressive symptom response and remission secondary outcomes were response and Pretreatment HRV predicted antidepressant outcomes as a function of anxious versus nonanxious depression In anxious depression patients with higher HRV had better outcomes whereas patients with lower HRV had poorer outcomes In nonanxious depression patients with lower HRV had better outcomes whereas patients with higher HRV had poorer outcomes Some simple effects were not significant Results did not differ by treatment arm and remained significant when controlling for important These findings inform a precision medicine approach in which clinical and biological assessments may be integrated to facilitate treatment outcome prediction Knowing about HRV may help determine which

Taylor Mackey Singh 2018 Abstract OBJECTIVE Sex differences in the brain are traditionally treated as binary We present new evidence that a continuous measure of sex differentiation of the brain can explain sex differences in psychopathology The degree of sex differentiated brain features ie features that are more common in one sex may predispose individuals toward psychopathology and may also be influenced by the genome We hypothesized that individuals with a differentiation score would have greater psychopathology internalizing symptoms such as anxiety and depression whereas individuals with a differentiation score would have greater psychopathology externalizing symptoms such as disruptive behaviors Using the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort database acquired from database of Genotypes and Phenotypes we calculated the sex differentiation measure a continuous calculation of each individual degree of sex differentiating features extracted from multimodal brain imaging data Magnetic resonance imaging MRI MRI from the imaged participants In males higher differentiation scores were correlated with higher levels of externalizing symptoms The differentiation measure reached association study significance p 5 in males with single nucleotide polymorphisms Chromsome5 rs111161632 RASGEF1C and Chromosome19 rs75918199 GEMIN7 and in females with Chromosome2 rs78372132 PARD3B and Chromosome15 rs73442006 The sex differentiation measure provides an initial topography of quantifying male and female brain features This demonstration that the sex of the human brain can be conceptualized on a continuum has implications for both the presentation of psychopathology and the relation of the brain with genetic variants that may be associated with brain differentiation View

depressive disorder MDD is characterized by biased information processing that leads to difficulties regulating negative affect which includes difficulty decreasing negative affect as well as maladaptively increasing negative affect via cognitive processes To examine the underlying neural correlates we scanned depressed and adults as they completed a cognitive reappraisal task which required decreasing negative affect while viewing a negative image and increasing negative affect while viewing a neutral image emotion generation Compared to control participants MDD participants had less recruitment of the dorsal anterior cingulate dACC and supplementary motor area SMA during early phases of the latter associated with poorer negative affect regulation Further MDD participants exhibited greater recruitment of the right middle temporal gyrus MTG during emotion generation which was associated with lower negative affect Dysregulated negative affect in MDD may be due to impairments in efficiently activating the dACC and SMA to meet regulation demands and maladaptive generation of negative affect that characterizes individuals with MDD may be counteracted by compensatory activation in the MTG Elucidating neural mechanisms that underlie the generation of negative affect in the absence of external stimuli is an important extension of previous work examining dysfunctional emotional processes in MDD View details for PubMedID 29689500 Depression A cognitive perspective Clinical psychology review LeMoult Gotlib 2018 Abstract Cognitive science has been instrumental in advancing our understanding of the onset maintenance and treatment of depression Research conducted over the last 50 years supports the proposition that depression and risk for depression are characterized by the operation of negative biases and often by a lack of positive biases in processing interpretation attention and memory as well as the use of maladaptive cognitive emotion regulation strategies There is also evidence to suggest that deficits in cognitive control over material underlie these cognitive processes Specifically research indicates that difficulty inhibiting and disengaging from negative material in working memory 1 increases the use of maladaptive emotion regulation strategies rumination decreases the use of adaptive emotion regulation strategies reappraisal and potentially impedes flexible selection and implementation of emotion regulation strategies 2 is associated with negative biases in attention and 3 contributes to negative biases in memory Moreover studies suggest that these cognitive processes exacerbate and sustain the negative mood that typifies depressive episodes In this review we present evidence in support of this conceptualization of depression and discuss implications of research findings for theory and practice Finally we advance directions for future research View details for PubMedID 29961601 Maternal

King Gotlib 2018 80 Abstract Experiences of psychosocial neglect affect the developing brain and may place individuals at increased risk for anxiety The majority of research in this area has focused on children who have experienced severe psychosocial deprivation it is not clear whether typical variation in neglect experienced in community samples would have the same neurobiological consequences as those documented in extreme samples The present study examined the associations among childhood neglect amygdala volume and anxiety symptoms in a community sample of 138 adolescents ages years 43 male Linear mixed modeling yielded a interaction of neglect sex and brain hemisphere reflecting a significant positive association between neglect and right amygdala volume in boys Additional analyses indicated that right amygdala volume significantly mediated the association between neglect and anxiety symptoms in boys These findings are consistent with previous reports of larger amygdala volumes in previously institutionalized children and with documented associations between caregiving deprivation and anxiety symptoms The results suggest that the effects of childhood neglect on limbic

the association between number of stressful life events experienced and ADHD symptoms assessed using the Attention Problems subscale of the Child Behavior Checklist in a sample of 214 children 43 male ages In addition we examined whether the timing of the events onset through age 5years or after age 6years was associated with ADHD symptoms Finally we examined variation in brain structure to determine whether stressful life events were associated with volume in brain regions that were found to vary as a function of symptoms of ADHD We found a small to moderate association between number of stressful life events and ADHD symptoms Although the strength of the associations between number of events and ADHD symptoms did not differ as a function of the age of occurrence of stressful experiences different brain regions were implicated in the association between stressors and ADHD symptoms in the two age periods during which stressful life events occurred These findings support the

early life stress Associations with the volume of brain regions in early adolescence Development and psychopathology King Humphreys Camacho Gotlib 2018 Abstract Researchers are becoming increasingly interested in linking specific forms of early life stress ELS to specific neurobiological markers including alterations in the morphology of brain regions We used a approach to investigate the associations of specific constellations of ELS with hippocampal and amygdala volume in a community sample of 211 to early adolescents Further we compared this approach to a cumulative risk model of ELS in which ELS was quantified by the total number of stressors reported Using latent class analysis we identified three classes of ELS labeled family instability and direct victimization that were distinguished by experiences of family instability and victimization Adolescents in the direct victimization class had significantly smaller hippocampal volume than did adolescents in the class ELS classes were not significantly associated with amygdala volume The cumulative risk model of ELS had a poorer fit than did the model moreover cumulative ELS was not significantly associated with hippocampal or amygdala volume Our results underscore the utility of taking a approach to identify alterations in brain regions based on constellations of ELS and suggest victimization is specifically associated with hippocampal hypotrophy observed in early adolescence View details for PubMedID 29716668 Differing Windows of Sensitivity to Stress in Prefrontal Cortex Structural and Functional

did control individuals Both groups had greater salience network connectivity the converted group had greater intranetwork connectivity than did the resilient z score P and control z score P groups and the adolescent females in the resilient group had greater salience network connectivity with the superior frontal gyrus than did the converted z score P adolescent adolescent females have compensatory functional connectivity patterns in emotion regulatory networks that correlate with positive life events suggesting that plasticity within these networks may confer resilience to

37 8 Asian 11 Hispanic 8 African American 2 Native American 2 Pacific Islander 28 Other and 3 not reported A subset of the sample provided data at a used to extend these associations There were no sex differences in levels of irritability however the associations between irritability and symptom domains were moderated by sex Specifically in girls irritability was associated equally with externalizing and internalizing symptoms In contrast in boys irritability was associated more strongly with externalizing symptoms than with internalizing symptoms Thus across both sexes irritability was moderately associated with externalizing symptoms but the association between irritability and internalizing symptoms was stronger in girls than in boys At sex moderated the association between baseline irritability and later externalizing and internalizing symptoms These findings indicate that irritability is associated with both externalizing and internalizing symptoms in early adolescence and that irritability is associated with internalizing symptoms more strongly in girls than in boys View details for PubMedID 29667523 effects of income on hippocampal volume trajectories in adolescent girls DEVELOPMENTAL COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE Humphreys Ordaz Camacho Sacchet Gotlib 2018 30 Abstract Children from families exhibit smaller hippocampal volume than do their peers Few studies however have compared hippocampal developmental trajectories as a function of SES Thus it is unclear whether initial stability is preserved or whether volumes over the course of adolescence In a sample of 101 girls ages years we examined the longitudinal association between family income and parental education proxies for SES and changes in hippocampal volume Hippocampal volume was obtained using MRI using mixed modeling we examined the effects of income and education on hippocampal volume across age As expected changes in volume were across development Further trajectories diverged in with girls exhibiting reductions in hippocampal volume Maximal differences were observed at 18 years and trajectories converged thereafter This interaction remained significant when accounting for maternal hippocampal volume suggesting a unique contribution of environment over potential heritable differences In contrast the association between parental education and offspring hippocampal volume appeared to be stable across adolescence with higher levels of parental education predicting consistently larger hippocampal volume These findings constitute preliminary evidence that girls from homes exhibit unique trajectories of hippocampal growth with differences most evident in late adolescence View details for PubMedID 29275097 View details for PubMedCentralID PMC5963716 Emotional Arousal May Increase Susceptibility to Fraud in Older and Younger Adults Kircanski Notthoff DeLiema Shadel Mottola Carstensen Gotlib AMER PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC 2018 Abstract Financial fraud is a societal problem for adults of all ages but financial losses are especially damaging to older adults who typically live on fixed incomes and have less time to recoup losses Persuasion tactics used by fraud perpetrators often elicit high levels of emotional arousal thus studying emotional arousal may help to identify the conditions under which individuals are particularly susceptible to fraud We examined whether inducing positive HAP and negative HAN emotions increased susceptibility to fraud Older ages 65 to 85 and younger ages 30 to 40 adults were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 emotional arousal conditions in a laboratory task HAP HAN or low arousal LA Fraud susceptibility was assessed through participants responses to misleading advertisements Both HAP and HAN emotions were successfully induced in older and younger participants For participants who exhibited the intended induced emotional arousal both the HAP and HAN conditions relative to the LA condition significantly increased participants reported intention to purchase falsely advertised items These effects did not differ significantly between older and younger adults and were mitigated in participants who did not exhibit the intended emotional arousal However irrespective of the emotional arousal condition to which older adults were assigned HAP HAN or LA they reported greater purchase intention than did younger adults These results inform the literature on fraud susceptibility and aging Educating consumers to postpone financial decisions until they are in calm emotional states may protect against this common persuasion tactic PsycINFO Database Record View details for PubMedID 29658750 approaches to examining stress in the adolescent brain NEUROBIOLOGY OF STRESS Ho Dennis Thompson Gotlib 2018 8 View

Abstract Suicidal ideation rates rise precipitously in adolescence contributing to risk for attempts Although researchers are beginning to explore the brain basis of attempts in depressed adolescents none have focused on the basis of ideation which has implications for prevention This study examined the association between intrinsic neural network coherence and the severity of suicidal ideation in depressed adolescents diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder were administered the Severity Rating Scale and underwent fMRI We quantified coherence in the executive control ECN default mode DMN and salience SN networks and in a network consisting of noise signal We associated coherence in each of these networks with the greatest lifetime severity of suicidal ideation experienced covarying for motion age of depression onset and severity of current depressive and anxious coherence in the left ECN anterior DMN and SN were independently associated with greater lifetime severity of suicidal ideation When including all three significant networks and covariates in a single model only the left ECN significantly predicted suicidal with a larger sample size are needed to verify our finding of hypoconnectivity in multiple networks extends emerging evidence for hypoconnectivity in adolescent suicidality and is consistent with theoretical conceptualizations of suicidal ideation as a complex

Gotlib 2018 8 Abstract Exposure to stress particularly in periods of rapid brain maturation such as adolescence can profoundly influence developmental processes that undergird the organization of structural and functional brain networks and that may mediate the association between stressful experiences and maladaptive outcomes While studies in translational developmental neuroscience often focus on how specific brain regions or targeted connections are altered by stress and psychiatric disease the emerging field of network science may be especially valuable for elucidating the impact of stress on the intricate connectomics of the adolescent brain Here we review recent studies that use graph theory and other network science approaches to understand normative adolescent brain development effects of childhood maltreatment on the brain and disorders characterized by pathological responses to stress in adolescents Overall these studies demonstrate that graph theory can be useful in identifying and quantifying developmental processes related to segregation integration and localized hub influence that are affected by stress exposure and that may lead to psychopathology Finally we discuss limitations in the current application of graph theory in this area and suggest what we believe are important directions for future work View details for PubMedID 29888310 factor 1

depression vulnerability and alterations in cognitive functioning The present study investigated the relations between the TAT haplotype and specific symptoms of depression ruminative behaviors and neuropsychological performance on a learning and memory task Participants were adults with major depression with and without psychotic features N 406 Associations were examined between TAT haplotype and endorsement of depression symptoms from diagnostic interviews scores on the rumination response scale RRS and verbal memory performance on the California Verbal Learning All analyses included depression subtype age and sex as covariates analyses also included evening cortisol levels Across the entire sample carriers of more copies of the TAT haplotype reported greater endorsement of the symptom describing difficulty concentrating and making decisions In separate subsamples TAT homozygotes had higher rumination scores on the RRS both brooding and reflection subscales and more TAT copies were associated with poorer performance in both total learning and free recall trials These data demonstrate that the CRHR1 TAT haplotype is associated with cognitive features of depression

connectivity dFC measures the temporal variability of network synchrony and captures individual differences in network neurodynamics This study investigated the relationship between dFC and individual differences in emotions induced by an acute psychosocial stressor Sixteen healthy adult women underwent fMRI scanning during a social evaluative threat SET task and retrospectively completed questionnaires that assessed individual differences in subjectively experienced positive and negative emotions about stress and stress relief during the task Group dFC was decomposed with parallel factor analysis PARAFAC into 10 components each with a temporal signature spatial network of functionally connected regions and vector of participant loadings that captures individual differences in dFC Participant loadings of two networks were positively correlated with emotions indicating the existence of networks for positive and negative emotions The networks involved the ventromedial prefrontal cortex cingulate cortex anterior insula and amygdala among other distributed brain regions and time signatures for these networks were uncorrelated These findings demonstrate that individual differences in positive and negative emotions are each uniquely associated with brain networks and suggest that dFC is a mechanism that generates individual differences in the emotional

significant risk factor for the emergence of internalizing problems in adolescence Beginning in adolescence females are twice as likely as males to experience internalizing disorders The present study was designed to examine sex differences in the association between ELS and internalizing problems in early pubertal adolescents and whether and how corticolimbic function and connectivity may underlie these associations early pubertal males and 78 early pubertal females ages years all Tanner Stage 3 or below underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging as they performed an emotion label task that robustly interrogates corticolimbic function Participants were also interviewed about their experience of ELS Females exhibited a positive association between ELS and internalizing problems whereas males exhibited no such association and amygdala region of interest analyses indicated that whereas females exhibited a positive association between ELS and the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex during implicit emotion regulation males showed no such association Activation in these regions was positively associated with internalizing problems in females but not males however activation in these regions did not mediate the association between ELS and internalizing problems Finally both boys and girls exhibited an association between ELS and increased negative connectivity between the right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex and bilateral amygdala Using a carefully characterized sample of early pubertal adolescents the current study highlights important sex differences in the development of corticolimbic circuitry during a critical period of brain development These sex differences may play a significant role in subsequent risk for internalizing problems View details for

adolescence While recent work using approaches indicate that depressed adolescents show limited versus connectivity termed between the ACC and networks no study has used approaches to investigate inflexibility of the ACC in networks to understand adolescent MDD Here we used graph theory to compare flexibility of topology in eight subregions of the ACC spanning three networks in 42 unmedicated adolescents with MDD and 53 healthy controls All participants underwent fMRI scanning during and a response inhibition task that robustly engages networks Relative to controls depressed adolescents were characterized by inflexibility in local efficiency of a key ACC node in the CEN right dorsal anterior cingulate frontal gyrus R Furthermore individual differences in flexibility of local efficiency of R significantly predicted inhibition performance consistent with current literature demonstrating that flexible network organization affords successful cognitive control Finally reduced

daughters and 23 mothers without past or current depression and their daughters underwent fMRI while performing the monetary incentive delay MID task To assess concordance we first identified ROIs

uncinate fasciculus UF a frontolimbic white matter tract that undergoes protracted development throughout adolescence Adolescence is an important transitional period characterized by the emergence of internalizing psychopathology such as anxiety particularly in individuals with high levels of stress sensitivity We examined the relations among sensitivity to ELS structural integrity of the UF and anxiety symptoms in 104 early adolescents We conducted structured interviews to assess exposure to ELS and obtained subjective and objective ratings of stress severity from which we derived an index of ELS sensitivity We also acquired diffusion MRI and conducted deterministic tractography to visualize UF trajectories and to compute measures of structural integrity from three distinct segments of the UF frontal insular temporal We found that higher sensitivity to ELS predicted both reduced fractional anisotropy in right frontal UF and higher levels of anxiety symptoms These findings suggest that fibers in frontal UF which are still developing throughout adolescence are most vulnerable to the effects of heightened sensitivity to ELS and that reduced structural integrity of frontal UF may underlie the relation between early stress and subsequent internalizing psychopathology View details for DOI View details for PubMedID 28460088 GABA editing with macromolecule suppression using an

however has been difficult to discern In fact both elevated and blunted patterns of diurnal cortisol regulation have been reported in children and adolescents exposed to greater ELS including both reduced and heightened cortisol levels and change in cortisol across the day These divergent findings may be due to developmental changes in the relation between ELS and functioning The present study was designed to examine the role of puberty in the impact of the severity of ELS on the regulation of diurnal cortisol Boys and girls ages years recruited from communities completed an interview about their ELS experiences and collection of diurnal cortisol ELS experiences were objectively coded for severity and children level of pubertal development was measured using Tanner Staging piecewise models tested the effects of ELS severity and pubertal stage on cortisol levels at waking the cortisol awakening response CAR and the daytime cortisol slope While we found no significant interactive effects of pubertal stage and ELS severity on cortisol levels at waking or the daytime cortisol slope findings indicated that pubertal stage interacted with ELS severity to predict the cortisol awakening response CAR Specifically in earlier puberty higher ELS was associated with a blunted CAR compared to lower ELS in contrast in later puberty higher ELS was associated with a heightened CAR compared to lower ELS Differences in the relation between ELS severity and the CAR were uniquely determined by puberty and not by age By considering and examining the role of puberty the current study provides a developmental explanation for previous divergent findings of both blunted and heightened patterns of diurnal cortisol following ELS These results indicate that careful attention should be

Using experience sampling we compared anticipatory and consummatory pleasure and displeasure for daily activities reported by adults with MDD n 41 and healthy controls n 39 Participants carried

participants reported blunted levels of both anticipatory and consummatory pleasure and elevated levels of both anticipatory and consummatory displeasure for daily activities Independent of MDD status participants accurately predicted pleasure but overestimated displeasure These results are the first to provide evidence that across both anticipatory and consummatory phases individuals with MDD

MDD and social anxiety disorder SAD in women diagnosed with MDD only n 35 SAD only n 31 MDD and SAD n 26 or no psychiatric disorder n 38 Results of the categorical analyses suggest that elevated

showing an additive effect for MDD and SAD Similarly diminished levels of emotional clarity characterised all three clinical groups compared to the healthy control group Dimensional findings suggest

Dynamic functional connectivity of neurocognitive networks in children HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING Marusak Calhoun Brown Crespo Gotlib Thomason 2017 38 1 Abstract The human brain is highly dynamic supporting a remarkable range of cognitive abilities that emerge over the course of development While flexible and dynamic coordination between neural systems is firmly established for children our understanding of brain functional organization in early life has been built largely on the implicit assumption that functional connectivity FC is static Understanding the nature of dynamic neural interactions during development is a critical issue for cognitive neuroscience with implications for neurodevelopmental pathologies that involve anomalies in brain connectivity In this work FC dynamics of neurocognitive networks in a sample of 146 youth from varied sociodemographic backgrounds were delineated Independent component analysis sliding time window correlation and clustering were applied to fMRI data Results revealed six dynamic FC states that over time and that complement but significantly extend measures of static FC Moreover the occurrence and amount of time spent in specific FC

negative emotional material While there is evidence that anomalous functioning in frontocingulate regions may underlie these biases we know little about the neural correlates of negative emotional biases in depressed adolescents diagnosed with MDD and 21 matched healthy control CTL adolescents underwent fMRI while performing an emotional distractor task On each trial participants were presented with house pairs and face pairs Participants indicated whether the house pairs were identical while ignoring the face pairs which were either fearful sad or equivalent behavioral performance response time and accuracy between groups adolescents with MDD exhibited greater activation in frontocingulate regions including dorsal anterior cingulate cortex dACC and inferior frontal frontal gyrus and occipitoparietal regions including lateral occipital cortex and superior parietal lobule when ignoring fearful versus neutral faces Response times to these trial conditions also correlated negatively with activation in and lateral occipital cortex suggesting these regions are recruited in order to effectively ignore emotional distractors Groups did not differ when ignoring sad versus neutral faces or fearful versus sad with MDD recruit both cognitive control and visual attention regions to a greater degree than do CTL adolescents reflecting greater cognitive demand when downregulating stimuli

LeMoult Kircanski Prasad Gotlib 2017 5 1 Abstract Most individuals who develop Major Depressive Disorder MDD will experience a recurrent depressive episode we know little however about cognitive mechanisms that increase the likelihood of recurrence In the current study we examined whether negatively biased processing negative life events baseline depressive symptoms and psychotropic medication use predicted the onset of a subsequent depressive episode in a longitudinal study of women with a history of recurrent MDD Higher levels of depressive symptoms at baseline predicted experiencing a greater number of negative life events which in turn tended to predict recurrence of depression Importantly after accounting for other associations negatively biased processing contributed unique variance to the likelihood of experiencing a depressive episode over the next three years Thus negatively biased processing appears to be a significant risk factor for the recurrence of depressive episodes and may be an important target for interventions aimed at preventing future episodes View details for DOI View details for PubMedID 28286705 Accelerated aging of the

disorder MDD is characterized by accelerated biological aging including greater changes in physiological functioning The disorder is also associated with abnormal neural reward circuitry particularly in the basal ganglia BG Here we assessed changes in BG volume in both patients with MDD and healthy control obtained images from patients with MDD and healthy controls We estimated grey matter volumes of the BG including the nucleus accumbens caudate pallidum and putamen Volumes were assessed using multivariate analysis of covariance MANCOVA with age as a covariate followed by appropriate post hoc included 232 individuals 116 patients with MDD in our analysis The MANCOVA yielded a significant group age interaction p Analyses for each region yielded a significant group age interaction in the putamen univariate test p permutation test p this effect was not significant in the other regions The negative association between age and putamen volume was twice as large in the MDD than in the control group indicating greater volumetric decreases in the putamen in individuals with MDD than in findings are future studies should assess the longitudinal impact of accelerated aging on anhedonia and neural indices of reward results indicate that putamen aging is accelerated in patients with MDD Thus the putamen may uniquely contribute to the adverse effects of depressive psychopathology and

development Recent fMRI studies of adults suggest that MDD is associated with abnormalities within and between networks RSNs Here we tested whether adolescent MDD is characterized by abnormalities in interactions among RSNs Participants were 55 unmedicated adolescents diagnosed with MDD and 56 matched healthy controls Functional connectivity was mapped using fMRI We used the statistic NBS to compare connectivity between groups and also compared the groups on graph metrics We further assessed whether group differences identified using nodes defined from functionally defined RSNs were also evident when using anatomically defined nodes In addition we examined relations between network abnormalities and depression severity and duration Finally we compared intranetwork connectivity between groups and assessed the replication of previously reported abnormalities in connectivity The NBS indicated that compared with controls depressed adolescents exhibited reduced connectivity p corrected between a specific set of RSNs including components of the attention central executive salience and default mode networks The NBS did not identify group differences in network connectivity when using anatomically defined nodes Longer duration of depression was significantly correlated with reduced connectivity in this set of network interactions corrected specifically with reduced connectivity between components of the dorsal attention network The dorsal attention network was also characterized by reduced intranetwork connectivity in the MDD group Finally we replicated previously reported abnormal connectivity in individuals with MDD In summary adolescents with MDD show hypoconnectivity between brain networks compared with healthy controls Given that connectivity among these networks typically increases during adolescent neurodevelopment these results suggest that adolescent depression is associated with abnormalities in neural systems that are still developing during this

cognitive neuroscience of socioeconomic status SES researchers are using neuroimaging to examine how growing up in poverty affects children neurocognitive development particularly their language abilities In this review we highlight difficulties inherent in the frequent use of reverse inference to interpret abnormalities in brain regions that support language While there is growing evidence suggesting that SES moderates children developing brain structure and function no studies to date have elucidated explicitly how these neural findings are related to variations in children language abilities or precisely what it is about SES that underlies or contributes to these differences This issue is complicated by the fact that SES is confounded with such linguistic factors as cultural language use first language and bilingualism Thus differences in brain regions that support language may not necessarily indicate differences in neurocognitive abilities In this review we consider the multidimensionality of SES discuss studies that have found differences in structure and function in brain regions that support language and suggest future directions for studies in the area of

processing of negative material Although negative biases have been studied using both behavioral and neuroimaging paradigms relatively little research has been conducted examining the difficulties of depressed persons with inhibiting the retrieval of negative information from memory In this study we used the paradigm and functional magnetic resonance imaging to assess the cognitive and neural consequences of memory suppression in individuals diagnosed with depression and in healthy controls The participants showed typical behavioral forgetting effects but contrary to our hypotheses there were no differences between the depressed and nondepressed participants or between neutral and negative memories Relative to controls depressed individuals exhibited greater activity in right middle

dimensionally focused studies suggests that levels of depressive and anxiety symptoms can interact with one another as reflected in a distinct psychobiological profile for individuals with high levels of both symptom dimensions Results of our analyses support this formulation we found that depressive and anxiety symptom dimensions interacted consistently in their relation to the measures of diurnal

Major Depressive Disorder MDD a psychiatric illness characterized by abnormalities in responding to negative feedback and by pessimism in evaluating the likelihood of future events No research to date however has examined human habenula responses to potential and experienced negative outcomes in MDD In this study depressed and healthy control participants performed a probabilistic guessing task for monetary rewards and penalties during functional magnetic resonance imaging of the habenula In healthy adults we observed a pattern of habenula activation consistent with its hypothesized role in predicting future losses and responding to suboptimal outcomes In contrast in depressed participants the left habenula was not activated significantly during the prediction or experience of monetary penalty Complementing this group difference attenuated habenula activation to negative feedback in control participants was associated with levels of shame and rumination The results of this study

present study we tested this formulation directly by examining the affective consequences of training depressed persons to response of SN nodes to negative material Ten participants in the real neurofeedback group saw and attempted to learn to activity from an empirically identified node of the SN Ten other participants engaged in an equivalent procedure with the exception that they saw neurofeedback indices from participants in the real neurofeedback group Before and after scanning all participants completed tasks assessing emotional responses to negative scenes and to negative and positive adjectives Compared to participants in the group from to participants in the group showed a greater decrease in response to negative stimuli a greater decrease in emotional response to negative scenes and a greater decrease in emotional response to negative adjectives Our findings provide support for a neural formulation in which the SN plays a primary role in contributing to negative cognitive biases in MDD View details for DOI View details for PubMedID 26862057 View details for PubMedCentralID PMC4803612 Impaired Retrieval Inhibition of Threat Material in Generalized Anxiety Disorder Clinical psychological science a journal of the Association for Psychological Science Kircanski Johnson Mateen Bjork Gotlib 2016 4 2 Abstract Generalized Anxiety Disorder GAD is characterized by cognitive biases toward information but the underlying mechanisms are unclear We translated a paradigm from cognitive science to investigate impaired inhibition of threat information as one such mechanism Participants diagnosed with GAD and control participants learned a series of pairs whereas some cues were associated only with neutral targets others were associated with both neutral and threat targets Next participants practiced retrieving neutral targets which typically suppresses the subsequent recall of unpracticed associated targets forgetting RIF Finally participants were tested on their recall of all targets Despite showing intact RIF of neutral targets the GAD group failed to exhibit RIF of threat targets Furthermore within the GAD group less RIF of threat targets correlated with greater pervasiveness of worry Deficits in inhibitory control over information may underlie the cognitive pathology of GAD which has important treatment implications View

Increases in Depressive Symptoms Over Time EMOTION Pe Brose Gotlib Kuppens 2016 16 1 Abstract Previous research has emphasized the critical role of negative cognitions as a vulnerability factor in predicting depressive symptoms Here the authors argue that processes that function to maintain negative cognitions may serve as a catalyst for the development of depressive symptoms in the context of negative circumstances and they suggest that poor updating of affective information in working memory is 1 such process Thus they posit that under high levels of stress individuals with poor affective updating are hindered in changing the negative content in working memory associated with stressful events and therefore are more likely to experience increased depressive symptoms over time To examine this hypothesis the authors assessed affective updating ability stress and depressive symptoms in 200 students who were entering their first year of tertiary education They assessed levels of depressive symptoms again both 4 months and 1 year later Under high levels of stress poor affective updating ability was associated with an increase in depressive symptoms at both 4 months and 1 year later These results demonstrate that affective updating ability is an important cognitive vulnerability factor that interacts with stressful events to accelerate the development of depressive symptoms and underscore the importance of designing early prevention or intervention approaches for individuals with this cognitive vulnerability View details for DOI View details for Web of Science ID

2016 38 2 Abstract A growing body of research has demonstrated that having a mother with a history of major depressive disorder MDD is one of the strongest predictors of depression in adolescent offspring Few studies however have assessed neural markers of this increased risk for depression or examined whether anomalies in adolescents at maternal risk for depression are related to neural abnormalities in their depressed mothers We addressed these questions by examining concordance in brain structure in two groups of participants mothers with a history of depression and their daughters and mothers and their scanned mothers with remitted RMD and without control CTL a history of recurrent episodes of depression and their daughters computed cortical gray matter thickness and tested whether mothers thickness predicted daughters RMD mothers and their daughters exhibited focal areas of thinner cortical gray matter compared with their counterparts Importantly the extent of thickness anomalies in RMD mothers predicted analogous abnormalities in their daughters this pattern was not present in identified neuroanatomical risk factors that may underlie the intergenerational transmission of risk for MDD Our findings suggest that there is concordance in brain structure in dyads that is affected by maternal depression and that the location direction and extent of neural anomalies in offspring mirror those of their recurrent depressed mothers View details for DOI View details for Web of Science ID 000379162600004 View details for PubMedID 27198667 View details for

Abstract Adults diagnosed with major depressive disorder MDD have been found to be characterized by selective attention to negative material and by impairments in their ability to disengage from or inhibit the processing of negative stimuli Altered functioning in the frontal executive control network has been posited to underlie these deficits in cognitive functioning We know little however about the neural underpinnings of inhibitory difficulties in depressed adolescents We used functional magnetic resonance imaging in 18 adolescents diagnosed with MDD and 15 and healthy controls CTLs while they performed a modified affective task that was designed to measure inhibitory control in the presence of an emotional distractor Participants were presented with either a happy or a sad face followed by a go or a target to which they either made or inhibited a motor response A group MDD CTL by valence happy sad by condition go analysis of variance indicated that MDD adolescents showed attenuated BOLD response in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex DLPFC and in the occipital cortex bilaterally to targets that followed a sad but not a happy face Adolescents diagnosed with MDD showed anomalous recruitment of prefrontal control regions during inhibition trials suggesting disruption in neural underpinnings of the inhibition of emotional distractors Given that the DLPFC is associated with the maintenance of information it is likely that sad faces differentially capture attention in adolescents with MDD and interfere with task demands requiring inhibition View details

Journal of abnormal psychology LeMoult Ordaz Kircanski Singh Gotlib 2015 124 4 Abstract Interactions between biological vulnerability and environmental adversity are central to the pathophysiology of depression Given evidence that the HPA axis influences biological responses to environmental events in the current longitudinal study the authors examined functioning negative life events and their interaction as predictors of the first onset of depression At baseline girls ages 9 to 14 years provided saliva samples to assess levels of diurnal cortisol production quantified by total cortisol production area under the curve with respect to ground AUCg and the cortisol awakening response CAR The authors then followed these participants until they reached age 18 in order to assess their subsequent experience of negative life events and the onset of a depressive episode They found that the influence of negative life events on the subsequent onset of depression depended on functioning at baseline Specifically negative life events predicted the onset of depression in girls with higher levels of AUCg but not in girls with lower levels of AUCg In contrast CAR did not predict the onset of depression either alone or in interaction with negative life events These findings suggest that elevated total cortisol production in daily life potentiates susceptibility to environmental

and recent advances in preventative treatments for this disorder an important challenge in pediatric neuroimaging is the early identification of individuals at risk for depression We examined whether machine learning can be used to predict the onset of depression at the individual level adolescents years old underwent structural MRI Participants were followed for 5 years to monitor the emergence of clinically significant depressive symptoms We used support vector machines SVMs to test whether baseline cortical thickness could reliably distinguish adolescents who develop depression from adolescents who remained free of any Axis I disorder Accuracies from subsampled classification were used to assess classifier performance Baseline cortical thickness correctly predicted the future onset of depression with an overall accuracy of 70 69 sensitivity 70 specificity Examination of SVM feature weights indicated that the right medial orbitofrontal right precentral left anterior cingulate and bilateral insular cortex contributed most strongly to this classification These findings indicate that cortical gray matter structure can predict the subsequent onset of depression An

MDD Researchers to date have relied almost exclusively on global of emotional clarity moreover no studies have examined emotional clarity as a function of valence although this may prove to be crucial in understanding the relation of emotional clarity to maladjustment In 2 studies we used methodology and multilevel modeling to examine the associations between emotional clarity and 2 constructs that have been linked theoretically with emotional clarity neuroticism and depression In Study 1 we assessed 95 college students who completed a measure of neuroticism In Study 2 we examined 53 adults diagnosed with MDD and 53 healthy adults Reaction times to negative and positive emotion ratings during the protocols were used as an indirect measure of emotional clarity Neuroticism was related to lower clarity of negative but not of positive emotion Similarly compared with the healthy controls individuals with MDD had lower clarity of negative but not of positive emotion It is important to note findings from both studies held after controlling for baseline RTs and current levels of negative and positive emotion These findings highlight the importance of assessing valence when examining

whether or how these regions differ among mood disorders and whether such abnormalities are or In this study we examined differences in subcortical gray matter volumes among euthymic BD MDD remitted

examine whether the tendency for depressed individuals to maintain negative content in WM and to experience difficulties maintaining positive content in WM is due to negative mood in congruency effects during a depressive episode or whether these tendencies are evident outside of a depressive who had recovered from a depressive episode and never disordered controls performed emotion and tasks designed to assess biases in updating emotional content in working to currently depressed individuals in previous studies recovered depressed participants disengaged from happy stimuli more quickly and from sad stimuli more slowly than did their the extension of a finding to recovered depressed individuals the present study does not test whether the identified emotion updating biases predict relapse or obtained results suggest that a decreased ability to disengage from negative content and to maintain positive content in WM represents a cognitive style that impairs adaptive

operations performed by the brain network DMN has prompted interest in examining the role of the DMN in MDD In this article we present findings showing reliably increased functional connectivity between the DMN and subgenual prefrontal cortex sgPFC that often predicts levels of depressive rumination We also present findings that while there is reliably increased regional cerebral blood flow in sgPFC in MDD no such abnormality has been reliably observed in nodes of the DMN We then detail a model that integrates the body of research presented In this model we propose that increased functional connectivity between sgPFC and the DMN in MDD represents an integration of the processes supported by the DMN with the affectively laden behavioral withdrawal processes associated with integration that produces a functional neural ensemble well suited for depressive rumination and that in MDD abnormally taxes only sgPFC and not the DMN This synthesis explains a broad array of existing data concerning the neural substrates of depressive rumination and provides an explicit account of functional abnormalities in sgPFC in MDD View details for DOI View details for Web of

during childhood and adolescence have been linked to the subsequent onset of major depressive disorder MDD These mixed findings may be due to developmental changes in functioning which have not been

girls ages years many of whom were at high risk for depression by virtue of having a maternal history of the disorder completed a laboratory stress task To index cortisol reactivity salivary cortisol samples were collected at baseline and 15min following the onset of the stressor Girls levels of pubertal development were measured using Tanner staging All participants were followed through age 18 in order to assess the subsequent development of MDD Pubertal stage moderated the effects of cortisol stress reactivity on the development of MDD Specifically the onset of MDD was predicted by cortisol hyporeactivity in girls who were earlier in pubertal development Tanner but by cortisol hyperreactivity in girls who were later in pubertal development Tanner findings demonstrate that girls cortisol stress reactivity predicts the subsequent onset of MDD and further that the nature of this effect depends on the girls level of pubertal development Results are discussed in the context of

MDD and shortened telomere length however is not clear Importantly both MDD and telomere length have been associated independently with high levels of stress implicating dysregulation of the HPA axis and anomalous levels of cortisol secretion in this relation Despite these associations no study has assessed telomere length or its relation with activity in individuals at risk for depression before the onset of disorder In the present study we assessed cortisol levels in response to a laboratory stressor and telomere length in 97 healthy young daughters of mothers either with recurrent episodes of depression daughters at familial risk for depression or with no history of psychopathology We found that daughters of depressed mothers had shorter telomeres than did daughters of mothers and further that shorter telomeres were associated with greater cortisol reactivity to stress This study is the first to demonstrate that children at familial risk of developing MDD are characterized by accelerated biological aging operationalized as shortened telomere length before they had experienced an onset of depression this may predispose them to develop not only MDD but also other medical illnesses It is critical therefore that we attempt to identify and distinguish genetic and environmental mechanisms that contribute to telomere shortening View details for DOI View details for

Social cognitive and affective neuroscience Hamilton Chen Waugh Joormann Gotlib 2015 10 4 Abstract Assessing neural commonalities and differences among depression anxiety and their comorbidity is critical in developing a more integrative clinical neuroscience and in evaluating currently debated categorical vs dimensional approaches to psychiatric classification Therefore in this study we sought to identify patterns of anomalous neural responding to criticism and praise that are specific to and common among major depressive disorder MDD social anxiety disorder SAD and comorbid Adult females who met formal diagnostic criteria for MDD SAD or and psychiatrically healthy participants underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging as they listened to statements directing praise or criticism at them or at another person MDD groups showed reduced responding to praise across a distributed cortical network an effect potentially mediated by thalamic nuclei undergirding attention SAD groups showed heightened anterior insula and decreased network response to criticism The group uniquely showed reduced responding to praise in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex Finally all groups with psychopathology showed heightened response to criticism in a region of the superior frontal gyrus implicated in attentional gating The present results suggest novel neural models of anhedonia in MDD behaviors in SAD and poorer outcome in Importantly in identifying unique and common neural substrates of MDD and SAD these results support a formulation in which common neural components represent general risk factors for psychopathology that due to factors that are present at illness onset lead to distinct forms of psychopathology with unique neural signatures View details for DOI View details

Interaction between the basal ganglia and the cortex plays a critical role in a range of behaviors Output from the basal ganglia to the cortex is thought to be relayed through the thalamus but an intriguing alternative is that the basal ganglia may directly project to and communicate with the cortex We explored an efferent projection from the globus pallidus externa GPe a key hub in the basal ganglia system to the cortex of rats and mice Anterograde and retrograde tracing revealed projections to the frontal premotor cortex especially the deep projecting layers originating from GPe neurons that receive axonal inputs from the dorsal striatum anterograde tracing in mice confirmed that the pallidocortical projection is GABAergic and in vitro optogenetic stimulation in the cortex of these projections produced a fast inhibitory postsynaptic current in targeted cells that was abolished by bicuculline The pallidocortical projections targeted GABAergic interneurons and to a lesser extent pyramidal neurons This GABAergic pallidocortical pathway directly links the basal ganglia and cortex and may play a key role in behavior and cognition in normal and disease states View details for DOI

between rumination in major depressive disorder MDD and the operations performed by the brain network DMN has prompted interest in examining the role of the DMN in MDD In this article we present findings showing reliably increased functional connectivity between the DMN and subgenual prefrontal cortex sgPFC that often predicts levels of depressive rumination We also present findings that while there is reliably increased regional cerebral blood flow in sgPFC in MDD no such abnormality has been reliably observed in nodes of the DMN We then detail a model that integrates the body of research presented In this model we propose that increased functional connectivity between sgPFC and the DMN in MDD represents an integration of the processes supported by the DMN with the affectively laden behavioral withdrawal processes associated with integration that produces a functional neural ensemble well suited for depressive rumination and that in MDD abnormally taxes only sgPFC and not the DMN This synthesis explains a broad array of existing data concerning the neural substrates of depressive rumination and provides an explicit account of functional abnormalities in sgPFC in MDD

Kircanski Gotlib 2015 55 Abstract Both elevated and blunted levels of cortisol secretion during childhood and adolescence have been linked to the subsequent onset of major depressive disorder MDD These mixed findings may be due to developmental changes in functioning which have not been previously assessed in the context of risk In the present study therefore we examined whether pubertal development moderated the influence of cortisol secretion on the subsequent development of MDD girls ages years many of whom were at high risk for depression by virtue of having a maternal history of the disorder completed a laboratory stress task To index cortisol reactivity salivary cortisol samples were collected at baseline and 15min following the onset of the stressor Girls levels of pubertal development were measured using Tanner staging All participants were followed through age 18 in order to assess the subsequent development of MDD Pubertal stage moderated the effects of cortisol stress reactivity on the development of MDD Specifically the onset of MDD was predicted by cortisol hyporeactivity in girls who were earlier in pubertal development Tanner but by cortisol hyperreactivity in girls who were later in pubertal development Tanner findings demonstrate that girls cortisol stress reactivity predicts the subsequent onset of MDD and further that the nature of this effect depends on the girls level of pubertal development Results are discussed in the context of clarifying previous findings and directions for future research are offered View details for

Mata Jaeggi Buschkuehl Jonides Kuppens Gotlib 2015 3 2 Abstract Major Depressive Disorder MDD is a prevalent disorder involving disturbances in mood There is still much to understand regarding precisely how emotions are disrupted in individuals with MDD In this study we used a network approach to examine the emotional disturbances underlying MDD We hypothesized that compared to healthy controls individuals diagnosed with MDD would be characterized by a denser emotion network indicating that their emotion system is more resistant to change Indeed results from a experience sampling study revealed that individuals with MDD had a denser overall emotion network than did healthy controls Moreover this difference was driven primarily by a denser negative but not positive network in MDD participants These findings suggest that the disruption in emotions that characterizes depressed individuals stems from a negative emotion system that is resistant to change View details for DOI

science a journal of the Association for Psychological Science Joormann Waugh Gotlib 2015 3 1 Abstract Interpreting ambiguous stimuli in a negative manner is a core bias associated with depression Investigators have used cognitive bias modification for interpretation to demonstrate that it is possible to experimentally induce and modify these biases This study extends previous research by examining whether affects not only interpretation but also memory and physiological stress response in individuals diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder MDD We found that was effective in inducing an interpretive bias Participants also exhibited memory biases that corresponded to their training condition and demonstrated differential physiological responding in a stress task These results suggest that interpretation biases in depression can be modified and that this training can lead to corresponding changes in memory and to decreases in stress reactivity Findings from this study highlight the importance of examining the relations among different cognitive biases in MDD and the possibility of modifying cognitive biases View details for PubMedID 25593790 The role of the medial

states but how they do it and which brain regions are responsible still remains unclear We examined whether people maintain emotional states with explicit elaboration of the emotion or without elaboration participants completed an emotion maintenance task in which they either maintained the emotional intensity from the first picture of a pair to compare to that of the second picture condition or only rated their emotional response to the second picture condition Supporting the maintenance hypothesis when maintaining vs not maintaining emotion participants exhibited increased height and width of activation in the dorsal medial frontal cortex MFC and lateral prefrontal cortex regions associated with explicit emotion generation and manipulation of contents in working memory respectively Supporting the maintenance hypothesis however when viewing negative emotional pictures vs neutral pictures that were not explicitly maintained participants exhibited greater duration of activity in the rostral MFC a region associated with implicit emotion generation Supported by behavioral findings this evidence that people maintain emotional states both naturally in the rMFC and strategically in the dMFC may be critical for understanding normal as well as disordered emotion regulation View details for DOI View details for Web of Science ID 000350105900017 View details for

Development and psychopathology Kircanski Gotlib 2014 26 4 Abstract Having a depressed mother is one of the strongest predictors of depression in adolescence We investigated whether the stress of having a mother with recurrent depression is associated with dysfunction in adolescents in the HPA axis and whether the tendency to use involuntary coping strategies in dealing with this stress is associated with exacerbation of dysfunction in this system daughters of mothers with recurrent depression high risk and 64 daughters of mothers low risk completed diurnal cortisol and stress assessments girls secreted more diurnal cortisol than did girls Whereas girls secreted higher levels of cortisol with increasing stress associated with having a depressed mother no such relation was present in girls Finally in contrast to girls girls at familial risk for depression who more frequently used involuntary versus voluntary coping exhibited the greatest elevations in diurnal cortisol These findings indicate that a tendency to utilize involuntary as opposed to voluntary coping strategies in dealing with stress involving maternal depression exacerbates already high levels of

analyses indicated that fractional anisotropy FA an index of white matter integrity along bilateral corticospinal tracts CST was higher in depressed than in nondepressed individuals MDP analyses

in endorsement of and memory for positive and negative a negative mood induction 60 girls between the ages of 10 and 14 who had recurrent depressed mothers high risk for depression and 91 daughters of

adjectives as they the absence of significant group differences in endorsement of positive or negative adjectives girls with the COMT Val158Met polymorphism recalled more positive but not negative words that they had endorsed than did girls who were homozygous for the Met allele COMT was not associated with recall of valenced adjectives in girls Across risk groups polymorphism was not associated with recall of valenced with over 150 participants there were relatively small numbers in some of the cells of this study limiting its statistical results suggest that assessing the

Symposium on Biomedical Imaging Sacchet Prasad Thompson Gotlib 2014 2014 Abstract Graph theory is increasingly used in the field of neuroscience to understand the network structure of the human brain There is also considerable interest in applying machine learning techniques in clinical settings for example to make diagnoses or predict treatment outcomes Here we used machines SVMs in conjunction with tractography to identify graph metrics that best differentiate individuals with Major Depressive Disorder MDD from nondepressed controls To do this we applied a novel procedure that incorporates iterative classifier performance to assess feature robustness We found that a measure of the balance between global integration and local specialization most reliably differentiated MDD from nondepressed individuals regional analyses suggested that heightened connectivity of the subcallosal cingulate gyrus SCG in MDDs contributes to these differences The current study provides a novel way to assess the robustness of classification features and reveals anomalies in neural networks in MDD View details for PubMedID 25580184 Can Memory Bias be Modified The Effects of an Explicit Training

DeCon A tool to detect emotional concordance in multivariate time series data of emotional responding BIOLOGICAL PSYCHOLOGY Bulteel Ceulemans Thompson Waugh Gotlib Tuerlinckx Kuppens 2014 98 Abstract The occurrence of concordance among different response components during an emotional episode is a key feature of several contemporary accounts and definitions of emotion Yet capturing such response concordance in empirical data has proven to be elusive in large part because of a lack of appropriate statistical tools that are tailored to measure the intricacies of response concordance in the context of data on emotional responding In this article we present a tool we developed to detect two different forms of response patterning and multivariate time series data of emotional responding and apply this tool to data concerning physiological responding to emotional stimuli While the findings provide partial evidence for both response patterning and synchronization they also show that the presence and nature of such patterning and synchronization is strongly View details for DOI View details for Web of Science ID 000335499900004 View details for PubMedID 24220647 View details for

Sacchet Furman Sherdell Gotlib 2014 25 5 Abstract Considerable research indicates that depressed individuals have better memory for negative material than do nondepressed individuals and that this bias is associated with differential patterns of neural activation It is not known however whether these aberrant activation patterns predict illness course Using functional neuroimaging we examined whether change in depressive symptoms is predicted by baseline patterns of neural activation that underlie negative memory biases in major depressive disorder Depressed participants viewed negative and neutral pictures during functional MRI at baseline and completed an incidental memory task for these pictures 1 week later Depression severity was assessed by administering the Beck Depression Inventory both at baseline Time 1 and at Time 2 an average of 18 months later Contrast maps of activation for subsequently remembered negative versus subsequently remembered neutral pictures were regressed against change in Beck Depression Inventory scores between Time 1 and Time 2 controlling for initial symptom severity Results from this analysis revealed no associations between memory sensitivity for negative stimuli and symptom change In contrast whole brain analyses revealed significant positive associations between changes in depressive symptoms and baseline neural activation to successfully recalled negative pictures in the posterior cingulate cortex and medial prefrontal cortex These findings indicate that neural activation in cortical midline regions is a better predictor of symptomatic outcome than is memory sensitivity for negative material View details for DOI View details for PubMedID 24356105 View details for PubMedCentralID PMC3947655 Increased insula

neural mechanisms underlying subjective dysfunction in insomnia we examined brain activity in 17 female insomniacs and 17 female healthy controls using simultaneous functional magnetic resonance imaging fMRI and electroencephalography EEG while they were resting and while they were trying to fall asleep In examining the dynamic regional activity within intrinsic brain networks we found that compared with controls insomniacs had greater involvement of the anterior insula with salience networks as well as insula BOLD correlation with EEG gamma frequency power during rest in insomniacs This increased involvement of the anterior insula was associated with negative affect in insomniacs Aberrant activation of the insula which integrates temporal and bodily states in arousal networks may

depressive episodes Little research however has evaluated the among these predictors in depressed samples Such information is descriptively valuable and potentially etiologically informative In the present article we summarize the existing literature and test four predictions in a sample of 62 clinically depressed individuals 1 participants who experienced a major life event prior to onset would be less likely than participants who did not experience a major life event to have a positive family history for depression 2 participants with a recent major life event would have fewer lifetime episodes of depression than would participants without 3 participants with a positive family history for depression would have more lifetime episodes of depression than would participants with a negative family history for depression and 4 we would obtain a interaction in which participants with a positive family history and without a major life event would have the most lifetime episodes whereas participants with a negative family history and a major life event would have the fewest lifetime episodes The first three predictions were confirmed and the fourth prediction partially confirmed These novel findings begin to elucidate the complex relations among these three prominent risk factors for depression and point to avenues of research that may help illuminate the origins of

characterized by abnormalities in structure function and connectivity in several brain regions Few studies have examined how these regions are organized in the brain or investigated structural aberrations that might be associated with depression METHODS We used graph analysis to examine the gray matter structural networks of individuals diagnosed with MDD n 93 and a demographically similar healthy comparison group n 151 with no history of psychopathology The efficiency of structural networks for processing information was determined by quantifying local interconnectivity clustering and global integration path length We also compared the groups on the contributions of nodes hubs and regional network measures including degree number of connections in a node and betweenness fraction of short path connections in a node RESULTS Depressed participants had significantly decreased clustering in their brain networks across a range of network densities Compared with control subjects depressed participants had fewer hubs primarily in medial frontal and medial temporal areas had higher degree in the left supramarginal gyrus and right gyrus rectus and had higher betweenness in the right amygdala and left medial orbitofrontal gyrus CONCLUSIONS Networks of depressed individuals are characterized by a less efficient organization involving decreased regional connectivity compared with control subjects Regional connections in the amygdala and medial prefrontal cortex may play a role in maintaining or adapting to depressive pathology This is the first report of anomalous gray

Abstract Little work has examined the relation between interoceptive awareness and symptoms of Major Depressive Disorder MDD Existing research suggests that depressed individuals exhibit impaired heartbeat perception though the results of this research have been equivocal Importantly depressed participants in these studies have had comorbid anxiety disorders making it difficult to draw inferences about interoceptive awareness in MDD The current study addresses this issue by assessing heartbeat perception in depressed women without current anxiety disorders and exploring the relation between interoception and perturbations in both affective intensity and decision making components of MDD postulated to be related to bodily women without concurrent anxiety disorders and controls performed a heartbeat perception task Participants completed the Affect Intensity Measure AIM and difficulty was assessed in MDD participants using the Structured Clinical Interview for women exhibited poorer heartbeat perception accuracy than did control participants Impaired accuracy in MDD participants was associated with reduced positive affectivity and difficulty in decision sample was composed exclusively of females and was heterogeneous with respect to treatment status thereby limiting our ability to generalize results to depressed males and to exclude the contribution of exogenous factors to the observed group of this study suggest that for depressed individuals without anxiety comorbidities disrupted perception of bodily responses reduces both the experience of

relationship of BAS functioning to aspects of cognitive vulnerability to depression however is not known Method The present study investigated associations among level of BAS functioning and the encoding and recall of positive and negative information in currently participants with a history of recurrent major depression recovered RMD and in control participants CTL Participants completed measures of levels of BAS and behavioral inhibition system BIS functioning Following a negative mood induction participants were presented with a series of positive and negative adjectives they indicated which words described them and later recalled as many of the words as they were able RESULTS The relationship of BAS functioning to processing was dependent on participant group Although lower BAS reward responsivity was associated with the endorsement and recall of fewer positive words across groups the magnitude of these associations was stronger and was only significant within the RMD group Furthermore only for RMD participants was lower BAS reward responsivity associated with the endorsement of more negative words These effects were not accounted for by depressive or anxiety symptoms current mood or level of BIS functioning CONCLUSIONS These results indicate that BAS functioning may be distinctively linked to negatively biased processing one facet of cognitive

Rumination defined as repetitive thinking about negative information has been found to lead to serious maladaptive consequences including longer and more severe episodes of major depression In this review we present and discuss research findings motivated by the formulation that individual differences in cognitive processes that control how information is processed influence the likelihood that thoughts will become repetitive and negative Several studies have demonstrated that a tendency to ruminate trait rumination is related to difficulties updating working memory WM and disengaging from and forgetting information Other investigators have documented that trait rumination is also associated with an enhanced ability to ignore distracting information and with more stable maintenance of information In contrast to trait rumination a state of rumination has been found to be related to widespread deficits in cognitive control In this article we discuss how the current accounts of control functioning can not explain this pattern of anomalous control functioning To explain these findings including unexpected and contradictory results we present an attentional scope model of rumination that posits that a constricted array of thoughts percepts and actions that are activated in WM or available for selection from memory affects the control functioning of trait ruminators This model explains at a cognitive level why rumination is particularly likely to arise when individuals are in a negative mood state it also accounts for a number of findings outside of the literature and generates several novel predictions View details for DOI View details for Web of Science ID 000323688000008 View details for PubMedID 23244316 View details for PubMedCentralID

significantly more when negative words were removed from WM than when they were maintained in WM in contrast nondepressed participants exhibited stronger neural activations in these regions for

experimentally tested whether such a potentially protective factor engaging in acute exercise reduces the adverse effects of repeated sad mood inductions in individuals who have recovered from depression We hypothesized that recovered depressed participants who engage in acute exercise report a smaller increase in negative affect NA and a smaller decrease in positive affect PA when exposed to a repeated sad mood induction habituation whereas participants who do not exercise show sensitization increased NA and decreased PA in response to a repeated adverse stimulus women recovered from MDD and 40 healthy control women were randomly assigned to either exercise for 15 minutes or quiet rest Afterward participants were exposed to two sad mood inductions and reported their levels of affect throughout the study Recovered depressed participants who had not exercised exhibited higher NA after the second sad mood induction a finding consistent with sensitization In contrast both recovered depressed participants who had engaged in acute exercise and healthy control participants showed no increase in NA in response to the repeated sad mood induction Participants who exercised reported higher PA after the exercise bout however our hypothesis concerning reported PA trajectories following the sad mood inductions was not supported Results suggest that exercise can serve as a protective factor in the face of exposure to repeated emotional stressors particularly concerning NA in individuals who have recovered from depression View details for DOI View details for Web of

with increased reward seeking Because youth with BD are especially vulnerable to negative behaviors understanding the neural mechanisms by which dysregulated affect interacts with the neurobehavioral processing of reward is clearly important One way to clarify how manic symptoms evolve in BD is to prime the affect before presenting rewarding stimuli The objective of this study was to investigate the neural effects of an affective priming task designed to positively induce mood before reward processing in adolescents with and without activity and behaviors during the anticipation of and response to monetary reward and loss after an affective prime were compared using functional magnetic resonance imaging in to adolescents with a recent onset of n 24 and demographically matched healthy comparison youth n 24 with the healthy control youth youth with BD had speeded reaction times and showed decreased activation in the thalamus and inferior temporal gyrus while anticipating gains after priming but increased activations in the middle frontal gyrus and parietal cortices while anticipating losses after priming Youth with BD also showed less activation in the inferior parietal lobule thalamus and superior frontal gyrus while receiving losses after prefrontal and subcortical activations during reward processing suggest mechanisms that may underlie disordered during

cognitive and neuroimaging changes This study examined if older adults with EOD compared with those with LOD would exhibit more severe symptoms of depression and consistent with the glucocorticoid cascade hypothesis have more hippocampal volume loss A second goal was to determine if LOD compared with EOD would demonstrate more cognitive and neuroimaging regular intervals over a period older depressed adults were assessed on the Status Examination and the Depression Rating Scale They were also assessed on magnetic resonance with LOD EOD had more depressive symptoms more suicidal thoughts and less social support Growth curve analyses indicated that EOD demonstrated higher levels of residual depressive symptoms over time The LOD group exhibited a greater decrement in cognitive scores Contrary to the glucocorticoid cascade hypothesis participants with EOD lost right hippocampal volume at a slower rate than did participants with LOD Right cerebrum gray matter was initially smaller

of recovery than was severity of MDD NA or PA at Time 1 Levels of attention to emotion at Time 1 in participants who recovered from MDD did not differ significantly from the levels reported by 53 individuals who had participated in the experience sampling Findings indicate that high levels of an otherwise adaptive emotional facet can adversely affect the course of MDD View details for DOI View

Abstract Major depression is associated with a wide range of neurobiological disturbances including anomalies in the structure and function of cortical and subcortical gray matter and dysregulation of the HPA axis In this chapter we review research demonstrating that many of these abnormalities are also present in offspring of adults with recurrent depression and discuss how such findings might reflect dysfunctional neuroregulatory systems that precede the onset of this disorder We also briefly discuss candidate genes and environmental factors that have been posited to be directly involved in the transmission of neural and abnormalities from depressed parents to their offspring and we review how by obtaining a better understanding of the neurobiological markers of depression risk we can facilitate the development of targeted strategies for the prevention and treatment of major depression View details for DOI View details for PubMedID 22573472 Depressive rumination and the C957T polymorphism of the DRD2 gene COGNITIVE AFFECTIVE BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE Whitmer Gotlib 2012 12 4 Abstract Depressed individuals who ruminate have difficulties learning from punishment and suppressing information The C957T polymorphism of the DRD2 gene which affects functioning of D2 dopamine receptors DRD2 that are expressed predominantly in the indirect pathway of the basal ganglia has been found to influence suppression and punishment learning Given these associations we examined in the present study whether depressive rumination is related to the C957T polymorphism in 317 clinically depressed individuals and 317 control individuals A 2 2 diagnostic group polymorphism analysis of variance conducted on depressive rumination scores yielded a significant interaction of group and C957T Individuals with two 957C alleles reported higher levels of depressive rumination than did individuals with one or two 957T alleles if they were depressed but not if they were healthy The present findings suggest that the dopaminergic system and DRD2 are related to the frequency of maladaptive rumination in depressed individuals Thus DRD2 may be an important target for the pharmacological treatment of depressive rumination View details for DOI View details for Web of Science ID 000311498900010 View details for PubMedID 22864973 The Everyday Emotional Experience of Adults With Major Depressive Disorder Examining Emotional Instability Inertia and Reactivity JOURNAL OF ABNORMAL PSYCHOLOGY Thompson Mata Jaeggi Buschkuehl Jonides Gotlib 2012 121 4 Abstract Investigators have begun to examine the temporal dynamics of affect in individuals diagnosed with major depressive disorder MDD focusing on instability inertia and reactivity of emotion How these dynamics differ between individuals with MDD and healthy controls have not before been examined in a single study In this study 53 adults with MDD and 53 healthy adults carried electronic devices for approximately 7 days and were prompted randomly 8 times per day to report their levels of current negative affect NA positive affect PA and the occurrence of significant events In terms of NA compared with healthy controls depressed participants reported greater instability and greater reactivity to positive events but comparable levels of inertia and reactivity to negative events Neither average levels of NA nor NA reactivity to frequency or intensity of events accounted for the group difference in instability of NA In terms of PA the MDD and control groups did not differ significantly in their instability inertia or reactivity to positive or negative events These findings highlight the importance of emotional instability in MDD particularly with respect to NA and contribute to a more nuanced understanding of the everyday emotional experiences of depressed individuals View details for DOI View details for Web of Science ID 000311527700003 View details for PubMedID 22708886 View

Kaplan Sherdell Gotlib Jonides J 2012 140 3 Abstract This study aimed to explore whether walking in nature may be beneficial for individuals with major depressive disorder MDD Healthy adults demonstrate significant cognitive gains after nature walks but it was unclear whether those same benefits would be achieved in a depressed sample as walking alone in nature might induce rumination thereby worsening memory and individuals diagnosed with MDD participated in this study At baseline mood and short term memory span were assessed using the PANAS and the backwards digit span BDS task respectively Participants were then asked to think about an unresolved negative autobiographical event to prime rumination prior to taking a walk in either a natural or urban setting After the walk mood and memory span were reassessed The following week participants returned to the lab and repeated the entire procedure but walked in the location not visited in the first session a counterbalanced design exhibited significant increases in memory span after the nature walk relative to the urban walk p η p 2 a large Participants also showed increases in mood but the mood effects did not correlate with the memory effects suggesting separable mechanisms and replicating previous size and participants findings extend earlier work demonstrating the cognitive and affective benefits of interacting

anger shame excitement and happiness whereas others have more general affective experiences of pleasure or discomfort that are not as highly differentiated Considering that individuals with major depressive disorder MDD have cognitive deficits for negative information we predicted that people with MDD would have less differentiated negative emotional experiences than would healthy people To test this hypothesis we assessed participants emotional experiences using a protocol Depression was assessed using structured clinical interviews and the Beck Depression As predicted individuals with

volumetric abnormalities have been found in adults and adolescents with bipolar disorder It is unclear however if these deficits are present early in the onset of mania or are a consequence of multiple mood episodes or prolonged exposure to medication The goal of this study was to examine whether youth with bipolar I disorder who recently experienced their first episode of mania are characterized by brain volumetric images from magnetic resonance imaging of 26 to adolescents with bipolar I disorder and 24 healthy controls with no personal or family history of psychopathology were analyzed using morphometry VBM with healthy controls adolescents with bipolar I disorder had significantly less gray matter volume in the left subgenual cingulate cortex p error FWE with a recent single episode of mania have smaller subgenual cingulate cortex volume than do their healthy counterparts suggesting that this anomaly occurs early in the onset of or may predate the disorder

characteristics Little is known however about the nature of the relation between pubertal status and brain physiology This is particularly important given findings that have linked the onset of puberty with both changes in cognitive functioning and increases in the incidence of depression and anxiety The present study examined relations between pubertal stage as assessed by Tanner staging and brain anatomy in a sample of 54 girls aged years Brain morphometric analysis was conducted using magnetic resonance imaging MRI The hippocampus and amygdala were manually traced on MRI scans in all participants Stepwise regression analyses were conducted with total intracranial volume ICV age and pubertal status as the predictor variables and hippocampus and amygdala volumes as outcome variables Pubertal status was significantly associated with left amygdala volume after controlling for both age and ICV In addition puberty was related to right hippocampus and amygdala volumes after controlling for ICV In contrast no significant associations were found between age and hippocampal and amygdala volumes after controlling for pubertal status and ICV These findings highlight the importance of the relation between pubertal status and morphometry of the hippocampus and amygdala and of limbic and subcortical structures that have been implicated in emotional and social behaviors

OF ABNORMAL PSYCHOLOGY Whitmer Gotlib 2012 121 3 Abstract Previous studies have demonstrated that individuals with major depressive disorder have difficulties switching attention from one task set to another In the current study we examined whether ruminative thinking drives the switching deficits of depressed individuals A secondary more exploratory goal of this study was to examine whether state rumination would impair depressed individuals ability to activate a new task set to inhibit a no longer relevant task set or both Participants underwent either a rumination induction or a distraction induction and then completed a backward inhibition task that measures general switching abilities and the ability to inhibit previous task sets Although depression was not related to switching ability as a main effect depressed individuals who were induced to ruminate exhibited poorer switching ability than did both depressed and control individuals who were distracted from ruminating and control participants who were induced to ruminate These findings suggest that depressed individuals are characterized by switching deficits only if they are ruminating Moreover the finding that state rumination did not affect participants ability to inhibit previous task sets suggests that state rumination primarily impairs noninhibitory processes It is interesting that the opposite pattern of results was obtained for trait rumination which was related to inhibitory deficits during switching but not to generally poorer switching Thus state and trait rumination may be associated with dissociable cognitive deficits View details for DOI View details for Web of Science ID 000307482700003 View details for PubMedID 22468767 Elevated Ambitions for Fame Among Persons Diagnosed With

depressive disorder CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGY REVIEW Teachman B Joormann Steinman Gotlib 2012 32 6 Abstract In this paper we examine the nature of automatic cognitive processing in anxiety disorders and Major Depressive Disorder MDD Rather than viewing automaticity as a unitary construct we follow a social cognition perspective Bargh 1994 that argues for four theoretically independent features of automaticity unconscious processing of emotional stimuli occurs outside awareness efficient processing emotional meaning uses minimal attentional resources unintentional no goal is needed to engage in processing emotional meaning and uncontrollable limited ability to avoid alter or terminate processing emotional stimuli Our review of the literature suggests that most anxiety disorders are characterized by uncontrollable and likely also unconscious and unintentional biased processing of information In contrast MDD is most clearly typified by uncontrollable but not unconscious or unintentional processing of negative information For the anxiety disorders and for MDD there is no sufficient evidence to draw firm conclusions about efficiency of processing though early indications are that neither anxiety disorders nor MDD are characterized by this feature Clinical and theoretical implications of these findings are discussed and directions for future research are offered In particular it is clear that paradigms that more directly delineate the different features of automaticity are required to gain a more comprehensive and systematic understanding of the importance of automatic processing in emotion dysregulation View details for DOI View details for Web of Science ID 000308049600013 View details for PubMedID 22858684 View details for PubMedCentralID PMC3419810 Functional Neuroimaging of Major Depressive Disorder A and New Integration of Baseline Activation and Neural Response Data AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRY Hamilton Etkin Furman Lemus Johnson Gotlib 2012 169 7 Abstract Functional neuroimaging investigations of major depressive disorder can advance both the neural theory and treatment of this debilitating illness Inconsistency of neuroimaging findings and the use of approaches have hindered the development of a comprehensive empirically informed neural model of major depression In this context the authors sought to identify reliable anomalies in baseline neural activity and neural response to affective stimuli in major depressive authors applied to neuroimaging investigations comparing depressed to healthy comparison groups with respect to baseline neural activity or neural response to positively negatively valenced to healthy subjects those with major depression had reliably higher baseline activity bilaterally in the pulvinar nucleus The analysis of neural response studies using negative stimuli showed greater response in the amygdala insula and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and lower response in the dorsal striatum and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in individuals with major depressive disorder than in healthy results support an elegant and neuroanatomically viable model of the salience of negative information in major depressive disorder In this proposed model high baseline pulvinar activity in depression first potentiates responding of the brain salience network to negative information next and owing potentially to low striatal dopamine levels in depression this viscerally charged information fails to propagate up the circuit to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex for contextual processing and reappraisal View details for DOI View details for Web of Science ID 000305853400007 View details for PubMedID 22535198 Cognitive aspects of depression WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY SCIENCE Kircanski Joormann Gotlib 2012 3 3 Abstract Depression is a prevalent and impairing psychiatric disorder that affects how we feel and how we think about ourselves and the world around us Cognitive theories of depression have long posited that various thought processes are involved in the development maintenance and recurrence of depressive episodes Contemporary research has utilized experimental procedures to examine cognitive processes in depressed individuals as well as the nature of the relation of these processes to the emotion dysregulation that is central to the disorder For example investigators have assessed the ways in which depression alters aspects of information processing including attention and perception interpretation and memory processes this research has generated relatively consistent findings In addition researchers have attempted to identify and elucidate the cognitive mechanisms that may link these biases in information processing to emotion dysregulation in depression These mechanisms include inhibitory processes and deficits in working memory ruminative responses to negative mood states and the inability to use positive and rewarding stimuli to regulate negative mood Results of these investigations converge on the formulation that depression is associated with increased elaboration of negative information difficulties in cognitive control when processing this information and difficulties disengaging from this information Research examining cognitive aspects of depression not only enhances our understanding of this common and costly disorder but also has implications for the treatment of depression and for future investigations of the biological foundations of this disorder View details for DOI View details for Web of

Participants were prompted randomly eight times per day and answered questions about their physical activity and affective state Over the week the two groups of participants did not differ in average

CTL underwent social stressors while their physiological responses were measured cortisol in Study 1 heart rate in Study 2 In both studies affective responses to the stressors predicted physiological responses in RISK girls but not in girls For RISK girls decreased positive affect in response to stress predicted increased cortisol reactivity in addition decreased positive affect and increased negative affect were associated with poorer heart rate recovery and habituation respectively Future research is needed to examine explicitly whether this coherence between affect and physiology is a

children recent research indicates that depression can be observed in children as early as the preschool period Yet little work has been done to explore the neurobiological factors associated with this early form of depression Given research suggesting a relation between adult depression and anomalies in neural circuitry the goal of the current study was to elucidate changes in functional activation during negative mood induction and emotion regulation in children with a history of depression The results suggest that a history of depression during the preschool period is associated with decreased activity in prefrontal cortex during mood induction and regulation Moreover the severity of current depressed mood was associated with increased activity in limbic regions such as the amygdala particularly in children with a history of depression Similar to results observed in adult depression the current findings indicate disruptions in neural circuitry associated with depression

depressive disorder themselves We have little understanding however of the specific factors that contribute to this risk The ability to regulate negative affect effectively is critical to emotional and physical health and may play an important role in influencing risk for depression We examined whether daughters whose mothers have experienced recurrent episodes of depression during their daughters lifetime differ from daughters of mothers in their patterns of neural activation during a negative mood induction and during automatic mood regulation Sad mood was induced in daughters through the use of film clips daughters then recalled positive autobiographical memories a procedure shown previously to repair negative affect During the mood induction girls exhibited greater activation than did daughters in brain areas that have frequently been implicated in the experience of negative affect including the amygdala and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex In contrast during automatic mood regulation daughters exhibited greater activation than did their counterparts in brain areas that have frequently been associated with regulation of emotion including the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex These findings indicate that girls at high and low risk for depression differ in their patterns of neural activation both while experiencing and while repairing negative affect and suggest that anomalies in neural functioning precede the onset of a depressive episode View details for DOI View details for Web of Science ID 000300198500007 View

of interest or pleasure in response to hedonic stimuli or experiences is a cardinal symptom of depression This deficit in hedonic processing has been posited to influence depressed individuals motivation to engage in potentially rewarding experiences Accumulating evidence indicates that hedonic processing is not a unitary construct but rather consists of an anticipatory and a consummatory phase We examined how these components of hedonic processing influence motivation to obtain reward in participants diagnosed with major depression and in controls currently depressed and 30 control participants rated their liking of humorous and nonhumorous cartoons and then made a series of choices between viewing a cartoon from either group Each choice was associated with a specified amount of effort participants would have to exert before viewing the chosen cartoon Although depressed and control participants did not differ in their consummatory liking of the rewards levels of reward liking predicted motivation to expend effort for the rewards only in the control participants in the depressed participants liking and motivation were dissociated In the depressed group levels of anticipatory anhedonia predicted motivation to exert effort for the rewards These findings support the formulation that anhedonia is not a unitary construct and suggest that for depressed individuals deficits in motivation for reward are driven primarily by low anticipatory pleasure and not by decreased consummatory liking View details for DOI View details for Web of Science ID 000300198500006

depressed and participants and then measured punishment and reward sensitivity with a probabilistic selection task In this task participants first learn the probability that different stimuli will be associated with reward and punishment During a subsequent test phase in which novel combinations of stimuli are presented participants sensitivity to reward is tested by measuring their tendency to select the stimuli that were most highly rewarded during training and their sensitivity to punishment is tested by measuring their tendency to not select the stimuli that were most highly punished during training Compared with distraction rumination led depressed participants to be less sensitive to the probability that stimuli will be associated with punishment and relatively less sensitive to punishment than reward participants and depressed participants who were distracted from rumination were as sensitive to reward as they were to punishment The effects of rumination on sensitivity to punishment may be a mechanism by which rumination can lead to maladaptive consequences View details for DOI View details for Web of Science ID 000310736900009 View details for PubMedID 22716241

Theorists contend that emotional awareness is vital to being able to use emotional information adaptively The extent to which individuals attend to and value their feelings or attention to emotion is a facet of emotional awareness Little research however has examined whether attention to emotion affects the magnitude or intensity of emotional experiences In the present study we examined the relations between attention to emotion and levels of affect in 53 healthy adults Participants carried electronic devices for approximately 7 days and were randomly prompted eight times per day to answer a series of questions At each prompt participants reported attention to emotion current negative affect NA and positive affect PA All findings presented were computed using multilevel modeling Replicating findings obtained using measures we found that attention to emotion was associated concurrently with higher levels of both NA and We also found prospectively that attention to emotion at one prompt predicted a decrease in levels of NA but no change in levels of PA at the subsequent prompt These findings suggest that emotional processes serve different functions over time and highlight the role of attention to emotion in affect regulation PsycINFO Database Record c 2011 APA all rights reserved View details for DOI View details for Web of Science ID 000297921200028 View details for

J Johnson McMahon de Zubicaray Montgomery Martin Wright Bookheimer Dapretto Toga Thompson 2011 1 6 Abstract Recently carriers of a common variant in the autism risk gene CNTNAP2 were found to have altered functional brain connectivity using functional MRI Here we scanned 328 young adults with diffusion imaging to test the hypothesis that carriers of this gene variant would have altered structural brain connectivity All participants 209 women 119 men age SD years were scanned with diffusion imaging HARDI at 4 Tesla After performing a fiber tractography using the full angular resolution of the diffusion scans 70 cortical regions of interest were created from each individual anatomical data to compute graph metrics for all pairs of cortical regions In graph theory analyses subjects homozygous for the risk allele CC had lower characteristic path length greater and global efficiency in analyses and lower corrected eccentricity maximum path length in 60 of the 70 nodes in regional analyses These results were not reducible to differences in more commonly studied traits such as fiber density or fractional anisotropy This is the first study that links graph theory metrics

documented that a key component of resilience is emotional flexibility the ability to respond flexibly to changing emotional circumstances In the present study we tested the hypotheses that resilient people exhibit emotional flexibility a in response to frequently changing emotional stimuli and b across multiple modalities of emotional responding As participants viewed a series of emotional pictures we assessed their affect facial muscle activity and startle reflexes Higher trait resilience predicted more divergent affective and facial responses corrugator and zygomatic to positive versus negative pictures Thus compared with their counterparts resilient people appear to be able to more flexibly match their emotional responses to the frequently changing emotional stimuli Moreover whereas participants exhibited divergent startle responses to positive versus negative pictures regardless of the valence of the preceding trial participants did not exhibit divergent startle responses when the preceding picture was negative individuals therefore appear to be better able than are their counterparts to either switch or maintain their emotional responses depending on whether the emotional context changes The present findings broaden our understanding of the mechanisms underlying resilience by demonstrating that resilient people are able to flexibly change their affective and physiological responses to match the demands of frequently changing environmental circumstances View details for DOI View details for Web of Science ID 000295372600006 View details for PubMedID

preschoolers who performed the task 4 decades ago Nearly 60 individuals now in their were tested on hot and cool versions of a task to assess whether delay of gratification in childhood predicts impulse control abilities and sensitivity to alluring cues happy faces Individuals who were less able to delay gratification in preschool and consistently showed low abilities in their twenties and thirties performed more poorly than did high delayers when having to suppress a response to a happy face but not to a neutral or fearful face This finding suggests that sensitivity to environmental hot cues plays a significant role in individuals ability to suppress actions toward such stimuli A subset of these participants n 26 underwent functional imaging for the first time to test for biased recruitment of frontostriatal circuitry when required to suppress responses to alluring cues Whereas the prefrontal cortex differentiated between nogo and go trials to a greater extent in high delayers the ventral striatum showed exaggerated recruitment in low delayers Thus resistance to temptation as measured originally by the task is a relatively stable individual difference that predicts

Slavich Monroe Gotlib 2011 45 9 Abstract Although exposure to early adversity and prior experiences with depression have both been associated with lower levels of precipitating life stress in depression it is unclear whether these stress sensitization effects are similar for all types of stress or whether they are specific to stressors that may be particularly depressogenic such as those involving interpersonal loss To investigate this issue we administered structured measures of early adversity depression history and recent life stress to one hundred adults who were diagnosed with major depressive disorder As predicted individuals who experienced early parental loss or prolonged separation lasting one year or longer and persons with more lifetime episodes of depression became depressed following lower levels of life stress occurring in the time period of three months prior to onset of depression Importantly however additional analyses revealed that these effects were unique to stressors involving interpersonal loss These data highlight potential effects in stress sensitization and demonstrate for the first time that individuals exposed to early parental loss or separation and persons with greater histories of MDD may be selectively sensitized to stressors involving interpersonal loss View details for DOI View details for Web of Science ID 000294885400003

relationship depends on a mother ability to respond to her infant cues which are largely Therefore it is likely that difficulties in a mother appraisal of her infants facial expressions will affect the quality of interaction This study aimed to investigate the effects of postnatal depression and anxiety on the processing of infants facial total of 89 mothers 34 with Generalised Anxiety Disorder 21 with Major Depressive Disorder and 34 controls completed a infants faces task when their children were between 10 and 18 mothers were more likely to identify happy faces accurately and at lower intensity than sad faces Depressed compared to control participants however were less likely to accurately identify happy infant faces Interestingly mothers with GAD tended to identify happy faces at a lower intensity than controls There were no differences between the groups in relation to sad sample was relatively small and further research is needed to investigate the links between mothers perceptions of infant expressions and both maternal responsiveness and later measures of child findings have potential clinical implications as the difficulties in the processing of positive facial expressions in depression may lead to less maternal responsiveness to positive affect in the offspring and may diminish the quality of the interactions Results for participants with GAD are consistent with the literature demonstrating that persons with GAD are intolerant of uncertainty and seek reassurance due to their worries View details for DOI View details for Web of Science ID 000294934700024

both maladaptive and adaptive components Levels of activity in the network DMN relative to the network TPN as well as activity in structures that influence DMN and TPN functioning may represent important neural substrates of maladaptive and adaptive rumination in used a unique metric to estimate DMN dominance over TPN from blood oxygenation data collected during rest in 17 currently depressed and 17 adults We calculated correlations between this metric of DMN dominance over TPN and the depressive brooding and reflective subscales of the Ruminative Responses Scale correcting for associations between these measures both with one another and with severity of depression Finally we estimated and compared across groups right cortex RFIC response during initiations of ascent in DMN and in TPN the MDD participants increasing levels of DMN dominance were associated with higher levels of maladaptive depressive rumination and lower levels of adaptive reflective rumination Moreover our RFIC analysis showed increased RFIC activation in the MDD participants at the onset of increases in TPN activity conversely healthy control participants exhibited increased RFIC response at the onset of increases in DMN findings support a formulation in which the DMN undergirds representation of negative information in depression and the RFIC when prompted by increased levels of DMN activity initiates an adaptive engagement of the TPN View details for DOI View details for Web of Science ID 000293080400011 View details for PubMedID 21459364 View details for PubMedCentralID PMC3144981

the order of the words and forward trials on which participants were asked to remember the words in the order in which they were presented were calculated Compared with control participants depressed

depression however have used analytical techniques that are capable of testing hypotheses of neural dysfunction in this disorder Moreover of those that have fewer still have attempted to determine the directionality of influence within functionally abnormal networks of structures We used multivariate GC analysis a technique that estimates the extent to which preceding neural activity in one or more seed regions predicts subsequent activity in target brain regions to analyze BOLD data collected during rest from depressed and persons We found that activation in the hippocampus predicted subsequent increases in ventral anterior cingulate cortex vACC activity in depression and that activity in the medial prefrontal cortex and vACC were mutually reinforcing in MDD Hippocampal and vACC activation in depressed participants predicted subsequent decreases in dorsal cortical activity This study shows that on a basis there is increased excitatory activity among limbic and paralimbic structures as well as increased inhibition in the activity of dorsal cortical structures by limbic structures in depression these aberrant patterns of effective connectivity implicate disturbances in the mesostriatal dopamine system in depression These findings advance the neural theory of depression by detailing specific patterns of limbic excitation in MDD by making explicit the primary role of limbic inhibition of dorsal cortex in the relation posited to underlie depression and by presenting an integrated neurofunctional account of altered dopamine function in this disorder View details for

psychiatric disorder Attempts to identify clinically relevant genetic variants in the oxytocin system have yielded associations between polymorphisms of the oxytocin receptor OXTR gene and both autism and major depression To date however little is known about how such variants affect brain structures implicated in these disorders Applying a manual tracing procedure to structural magnetic resonance images amygdala volumes were measured in 51 girls genotyped on OXTR rs2254298 G A a single nucleotide polymorphism associated with psychopathology Results of this study indicate that despite having greater gray matter volume participants homozygous for the G allele were characterized by smaller volumes of both left and right amygdala than were carriers of the A allele A subsequent morphometry analysis revealed additional volumetric group differences in the posterior brain stem and dorsomedial anterior cingulate cortex These findings highlight one neurobiological pathway by which oxytocin

implicated in psychopathology In this study we examined whether individuals could use fMRI neurofeedback to modulate sACC activity Following a localizer task used to identify an sACC region of interest an experimental group of eight women participated in four scans 1 a pretraining scan in which they were asked to decrease activity in the sACC without neurofeedback 2 two training scans in which sACC neurofeedback was presented along with instructions to decrease sACC activity and 3 a scan An additional nine women in a yoked feedback control group saw sACC activity from the participants in the experimental group Activity in the sACC was significantly reduced during neurofeedback training in the experimental group but not in the control group This training effect in the experimental group however did not generalize to the scan A psychophysiological interaction analysis showed decreased correlation in the experimental group relative to the sham control group between activity in the sACC and the posterior cingulate cortex during neurofeedback training relative to scans The finding that individuals can the sACC shows that a primary emotion center in which functional

interacts with familial risk for psychopathology to predict symptoms of depression and anxiety in adolescent girls PSYCHONEUROENDOCRINOLOGY Thompson Parker Hallmayer Waugh Gotlib 2011 36 1 Abstract The nonapeptide oxytocin and its receptor have been implicated in the regulation of mammalian social behavior and stress physiology Evidence is accumulating that the quality of the parental environment is associated with oxytocin biology in children The present study was designed to examine the interaction of the single nucleotide polymorphism SNP rs2254298 within the oxytocin receptor OXTR gene and quality of parental environment in predicting children psychosocial functioning More specifically in a sample of 92 Caucasian adolescent girls years old we examined whether adverse parental environment operationalized as mothers history of recurrent major depressive disorder interacts with the rs2254298 SNP on the OXTR gene to predict daughters symptoms of depression and anxiety Caucasian girls who both were heterozygous for the OXTR rs2254298 polymorphism and had high early adversity reported the highest levels of symptoms of depression physical anxiety and social anxiety

Eugene Dennis Gotlib 2010 10 4 Abstract Rumination or recursive thinking has important implications for understanding the development and maintenance of depressive episodes Rumination is associated with the worsening of negative mood states greater affective responding to negative material and increased access to negative memories The present study was designed to use fMRI to examine neural aspects of rumination in depressed and healthy control individuals We used a rumination induction task to assess differences in patterns of neural activation during ruminative as compared with a concrete distraction condition and with a novel abstract distraction condition in 14 participants who were diagnosed with major depressive disorder and 14 healthy control participants Depressed participants exhibited increased activation in the orbitofrontal cortex subgenual anterior cingulate and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex as compared with healthy controls during rumination versus concrete distraction Neural activity during rumination versus abstract distraction was greater for depressed than for control participants in the amygdala rostral anterior prefrontal cortex

systems such as the dopamine DA system influence this development in healthy children however is lacking COMT is the major enzyme responsible for DA degradation in prefrontal brain structures for which there is a corresponding genetic polymorphism val158met that confers either a more or less efficient version of this enzyme The result of this common genetic variation is that children may have more or less available synaptic DA in prefrontal brain regions In the present study we examined the relation between diffusion properties of frontal white matter structures and the COMT val158met polymorphism in 40 children ages We found that the val allele was associated with significantly elevated fractional anisotropy values and reduced axial and radial diffusivities These results indicate that the development of white matter in healthy children is related to COMT genotype and that alterations in white matter may be related to the differential availability of prefrontal DA This investigation paves the way for further studies of how common functional variants in the genome might influence the development of brain white matter View details for DOI View details for Web of

Updating Positive and Negative Stimuli in Working Memory in Depression JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL Levens Gotlib 2010 139 4 Abstract Difficulties in the ability to update stimuli in working memory WM may underlie the problems with regulating emotions that lead to the development and perpetuation of mood disorders such as depression To examine the ability to update affective material in WM the authors had diagnosed depressed and control participants perform an emotion task in which participants were presented with a series of happy sad and neutral faces and were asked to indicate whether the current face had the same or different or emotional expression as that presented 2 faces earlier Participants also performed a task with the same emotional stimuli to serve as a control for perceptual processing After transforming reaction times to control for baseline group differences depressed and nondepressed participants exhibited biases in updating emotional content that reflects the tendency to keep negative information and positive information respectively active in WM Compared with controls depressed participants were both slower to disengage from sad stimuli and faster to disengage from happy facial expressions In contrast nondepressed controls took longer to disengage from happy stimuli than from neutral or sad stimuli These group differences in reaction times may reflect both

In this paper we assess these temporal dynamics by using hemodynamic response functions HRF to model BOLD responses to emotional stimuli We show that these HRFs lead to a better fit to the BOLD data and yield larger areas of significant activation than do conventional canonical HRFs We also report for the first time that intensity of emotional experience is associated with both magnitude and duration of brain activation Specifically greater negative emotional intensity was associated with greater magnitude of activation in the occipital cortex and with longer duration of activation in regions along the cortical midline associated with processing the anterior medial prefrontal cortex and the posterior cingulate cortex These data significantly advance our understanding of how the brain processes emotion and suggest that the intensity of a negative emotional experience is due in part to elaborative processing that is captured by the duration of neural activity in cortical midline structures These data also underscore the importance of using modeling techniques that will help elucidate the chronometry of both normal and psychopathological emotional processes View

emotion in depression inhibitory processes and deficits in working memory ruminative responses to negative mood states and negative life events and the inability to use positive and rewarding stimuli to regulate negative mood In this review we present a contemporary characterization of depressive cognition and discuss how different cognitive processes are related not only to each other but also to emotion dysregulation the hallmark feature of depression We conclude that depression is characterized by increased elaboration of negative information by difficulties disengaging from negative material and by deficits in cognitive control when processing negative information We discuss treatment implications of these conclusions and argue that the study of cognitive aspects of depression must be broadened by investigating neural and genetic factors that are related to cognitive dysfunction in this disorder Such integrative investigations should help us gain a more comprehensive

The aim of the current study was to identify cognitive processes that may be associated with the use of emotion regulation strategies and to elucidate their relation to depression Depression has been found to be associated with difficulties in cognitive control and more specifically with difficulties inhibiting the processing of negative material We used a negative affective priming task to assess the relations among inhibition and individual differences in the habitual use of rumination reappraisal and expressive suppression in clinically depressed formerly depressed and participants We found that depressed participants exhibited the predicted lack of inhibition when processing negative material Moreover within the group of depressed participants reduced inhibition of negative material was associated with greater rumination Across the entire sample reduced inhibition of negative material was related to less use of reappraisal and more use of expressive suppression Finally within the formerly depressed group less use of reappraisal more use of rumination and greater expressive suppression were related to higher levels of depressive symptoms These findings suggest that individual differences in the use of emotion regulation strategies play an important role in depression and that deficits in cognitive control are related to the use of maladaptive emotion regulation strategies

Depression is characterized by a range of cognitive deficits that theorists posit are due to the resource capturing properties of rumination The present study was designed to examine the relation between rumination and resource allocation in depression depressed and 25 nondepressed participants completed a modified version of the task which assesses the controlled allocation of cognitive resources by comparing performance across and conditions In conditions participants performed either the task or a tracking task which required participants to track specific stimuli across trials no interference In the condition participants performed both the task and the tracking task which required the controlled allocation of resources to resolve interference Depressed participants performed significantly worse than did their nondepressed counterparts in only the condition performance of the 2 groups was comparable in the conditions Furthermore the degree to which depressed participants

between BDNF gene variants and neural resting connectivity in children and adolescents We observed a reduction in hippocampal and parahippocampal to cortical connectivity in carriers within both and executive networks In contrast we observed increased connectivity to amygdala insula and striatal regions in within the paralimbic network Because of the known association between the BDNF gene and neuropsychiatric disorder this latter finding of greater connectivity in circuits important for emotion processing may indicate a new neural mechanism through which these psychiatric differences are manifest Here we show that the BDNF gene known to regulate synaptic plasticity and connectivity in the brain affects functional connectivity at the neural systems level In addition we demonstrate that

transporter polymorphism predicts waking cortisol in young girls PSYCHONEUROENDOCRINOLOGY Chen Joormann Hallmayer Gotlib 2009 34 5 Abstract Major Depressive Disorder MDD is one of the most prevalent and costly of all psychiatric disorders The hypothalamic pituitary adrenal HPA which regulates the hormonal response to stress has been found to be disrupted in depression HPA dysregulation may represent an important risk factor for depression To examine a possible genetic underpinning of this risk factor without the confound of current or lifetime depression we genotyped 84 young girls over a third of whom were at elevated risk for depression to assess the association between a polymorphism in the promoter region of the serotonin transporter gene and diurnal variation in activity This polymorphic region has been previously found to interact with stress to increase risk for depression We found to be significantly associated with diurnal cortisol levels girls who were homozygous for the had higher levels of waking but not afternoon or evening cortisol than did their counterparts This finding suggests that genetic susceptibility to dysregulation especially apparent in levels of waking cortisol is detectable in individuals as young as 9 years of age View details for DOI View details for PubMedID 19128885 Sadder and Less Accurate False Memory for Negative Material in Depression JOURNAL OF ABNORMAL PSYCHOLOGY Joormann Teachman B Gotlib 2009 118 2 Abstract Previous research has demonstrated that induced sad mood is associated with increased accuracy of recall in certain memory tasks the effects of clinical depression however are likely to be quite different The authors used the paradigm to examine the impact of clinical depression on erroneous recall of neutral emotional stimuli Specifically they presented lists that were highly associated with negative neutral or positive lures and compared participants diagnosed with major depressive disorder and nondepressed control participants on the accuracy of their recall of presented material and their false recall of lures Compared with control participants major depressive disorder participants recalled fewer words that had been previously presented but were more likely to falsely recall negative lures there were no differences between major depressive disorder and control participants in false recall of positive or neutral lures These findings indicate that depression is associated with false memories of negative material View details for DOI View details for Web of Science ID

2009 26 5 Abstract A hallmark characteristic of depression is the inability to regulate the effect of emotional material on cognition Previous research has demonstrated that depressed individuals are less able than are nondepressed persons to expel irrelevant negative information from working memory WM thereby exacerbating the effects of negative content on cognition The primary goal of this study was to examine whether depressed individuals are also impaired at selecting relevant positive content in the context of representations competing for resources in WM such an impairment would limit depressed persons ability to use positive material to ameliorate the cognitive effects of negative administered a task with neutral positive and negative words to 20 currently depressed and 22 participants This task assesses the selection of relevant content in WM by inducing interference between current and prior representations of a stimulus in WM Reaction times to interference and noninterference trials were compared across valence and group to assess how effectively depressed individuals select emotional content to resolve to controls depressed individuals were impaired in selecting positive stimuli the performance of the two groups was comparable for selecting neutral and negative indicate that a deficit in WM may contribute to the inability of depressed individuals to regulate emotion and provide empirical support for formulations that implicate positive insensitivity in the maintenance of depression View details for DOI View details for Web of Science ID

depression Little is known however about how exposure to such stressors is related to the clinical presentation of this disorder We addressed this issue by administering an measure of life stress the Beck Depression Inventory and the Global Assessment of Functioning scale to 100 adults diagnosed with major depressive disorder Participants who experienced a preonset severe life event exhibited greater overall levels of depression severity endorsed more cognitive and somatic symptoms of depression and functioned at lower levels than did their counterparts without preonset severe life events In contrast exposure to a preonset severe difficulty was unrelated to participants severity of depression cognitive and somatic symptoms or level of global functioning These findings highlight the

their cues The authors compared 3 different conditions an unaided condition a condition and a condition In the substitute conditions participants were instructed to use new targets to keep from thinking about the original targets After the training phase participants were instructed to recall all targets when presented with the cues MDD participants in contrast with control participants did not exhibit forgetting of negative words in the unaided condition In both the negative and positive substitute conditions however MDD participants showed successful forgetting of negative words and a

PERSPECTIVES Kovacs Joormann Gotlib 2008 2 3 Abstract Clinical depression is a significant mental health problem that is associated with personal suffering and impaired functioning These effects underscore the continuing need for new approaches that can inform researchers and clinicians when designing interventions We propose that individual differences in the of sadness and distress provide an important link between stress depressed mood and the onset of depressive disorder and that if we have a better understanding of the ways children successfully manage negative emotions we can better prevent and treat pediatric depression In this article we therefore examine the normative development of responses that children use to attenuate sadness and aspects of the neurobiological infrastructure that both enable and constrain such efforts We also address the emerging literature on affect regulation among children at familial risk for depressive disorders We conclude that problems with adaptively sadness and distress represent one pathway that can lead to depression And we need integrated developmental studies of the psychosocial and neurobiological aspects of responses to sadness and distress in order to better understand this process and to design intervention strategies for pediatric depression View details for Web of Science ID 000270262600005 View

major depressive disorder MDD is characterized by decreased volumes of several cortical and subcortical structures including the hippocampus amygdala anterior cingulate cortex and caudate nucleus The purpose of the present study was to identify structural volumetric differences between MDD and healthy participants using a method that allows a comparison of gray and white matter volume across the whole brain In addition we explored the relation between symptom severity and brain regions with decreased volumes in MDD participants The study group comprised 22 women diagnosed with MDD and 25 healthy women with no history of major psychiatric disorders Magnetic resonance brain images were analyzed using optimized morphometry to examine group differences in regional gray and white matter volume Compared with healthy controls MDD participants were found to have decreased gray matter volume in the bilateral caudate nucleus and the thalamus No group differences were found for white matter volume nor were there significant correlations between gray matter volumes and symptom severity within the MDD group The present results suggest that smaller volume of the caudate nucleus may be related to the pathophysiology of MDD and may account for abnormalities of the loop in MDD View details for DOI View details for Web of Science ID 000261551600003 View details for PubMedID 18930633

depressive disorder has been associated with volumetric abnormality in the amygdala In this we examine results from magnetic resonance imaging volumetry studies of the amygdala in depression in order to assess both the nature of the relationship between depression and amygdala volume as well as the influence of extraexperimental factors that may account for significant variability in reported findings We searched PubMed and ISI Web of Knowledge databases for articles published from 1985 to 2008 that used the wildcard terms and in the title keywords or abstract From the 13 studies that met inclusion criteria for our we calculated aggregate effect size and heterogeneity estimates from amygdala volumetric data we then used to determine whether variability in specific extraexperimental factors accounted for variability in findings The lack of a reliable difference in amygdala volume between depressed and individuals was accounted for by a positive correlation between amygdala volume differences and the proportion of medicated depressed persons in study samples whereas the aggregate effect size calculated from studies that included only medicated individuals indicated that amygdala volume was significantly increased in depressed relative to healthy persons studies with only unmedicated depressed individuals showed a reliable decrease in amygdala volume in depression These findings are consistent with a formulation in which an increase in levels of neurotrophic factor promotes neurogenesis and protects against glucocorticoid toxicity in the amygdala in medicated

are characterized by decreases in BOLD signal Independent component analysis can be used to produce a picture of the DMN as an individual rests quietly in the scanner Contrasts across conditions in which cognitive load is parametrically modulated can delineate neural structures that have decreases in activation in response to task conditions Examination of the degree to which these networks subsume dissociable brain substrates and of the degree to which they overlap provides insight concerning their purpose function and the nature of their associations Few studies have examined the DMN in children and none have tested whether the neural regions that comprise the DMN during a resting condition are the same regions that show reduced activity when children engage in cognitive tasks In this paper we describe regions that show both decreases and spontaneous intrinsic activity at rest in children and we examine the of these networks We describe ways in which the DMN in children is both similar to and different from the DMN in adults moreover we document that deactivations and activity in children share common neural substrates It appears therefore that even before adolescence a core aspect of deactivation involves reallocating processing resources that are active at rest We describe how future studies assessing the development of these systems would benefit from examining

Neural substrates of increased memory sensitivity for negative stimuli in major depression 62nd Annual Meeting of the Hamilton Gotlib ELSEVIER SCIENCE 2008 Abstract Although memory biases for negatively valenced stimuli have been reliably associated with depression and have been postulated to play a critical role in the maintenance of this disorder the neural bases of these biases have received little attention In this study we tested a model of heightened memory sensitivity for negative information in depression in which neural mechanisms that normally facilitate memory for affective material are during encoding of negative material in used functional magnetic resonance imaging to examine amygdala activity and functional connectivity with the hippocampus and during successful encoding as assessed by a recognition memory probe 1 week after scanning of negative neutral and positive pictures by 14 depressed and 12 nondepressed individuals demonstrated greater memory sensitivity than nondepressed participants to negative but not to neutral or positive stimuli The right amygdala was more active and showed greater functional connectivity with the hippocampus and in depressed than in control participants during encoding of subsequently remembered negative but not neutral or positive stimuli The degree of right amygdala responsivity in the depressed participants was significantly correlated with depressive findings support the formulation that in remembering negative information better than nondepressed persons depressed individuals a neural

relation to major life stress and changes in cognition over time In this paper we present a novel perspective for investigating the etiological relevance of cognitive factors in depression We hypothesize that individuals who experienced a severe life event prior to the onset of major depression will exhibit greater changes in dysfunctional attitudes over the course of the episode than will individuals without a severe life participants diagnosed with major depression were assessed longitudinally approximately 1 year apart with measures of life stress and dysfunctional individuals with a severe life event prior to episode onset exhibited greater changes in cognitive biases over time than did depressed individuals without a prior severe event These results were especially pronounced for individuals who no longer met diagnostic criteria for major depression at the second patterns of change in cognitive biases over the course of depression as a function of major life stress support

mood and may involve amygdala response which is implicated in memory for emotionally arousing stimuli This study examined whether amygdala modulates memory for negatively valenced words before and after a sad mood induction in healthy individuals with and without a history of recurrent major unmedicated remitted depressed RD and 14 matched never depressed ND individuals were scanned using functional magnetic resonance imaging fMRI while performing a task SRET preceding and following a sad mood challenge After each SRET participants free recall was sad mood induction bilateral amygdala response during encoding of valenced words predicted increased recall of negative words for a subset of RD participants This association was not present before the sad mood induction and was not evident in individuals without a history of depression regardless of mood results are consistent with cognitive theories and suggest a role for the amygdala in modulating memory during transient sad mood in individuals who are vulnerable to depression relapse View details for DOI View details for Web of Science ID 000243454900015 View details for PubMedID 16950223 Amygdala activation in the

JOURNAL OF ABNORMAL PSYCHOLOGY Joormann Gotlib 2006 115 4 Abstract The present study was designed to examine the operation of biases in the identification or labeling of facial expression of emotions Participants diagnosed with major depression and social phobia and control participants were presented with faces that expressed increasing degrees of emotional intensity slowly changing from a neutral to a happy sad or angry expression The authors assessed individual differences in the intensity of facial expression of emotion that was required for the participants to accurately identify the emotion being expressed The depressed participants required significantly greater intensity of emotion than did the social phobic and the control participants to correctly identify happy expressions and less intensity to identify sad than angry expressions In contrast social phobic participants needed less intensity to correctly identify the angry expressions than did the depressed and control participants and less intensity to identify angry than sad expressions Implications of these results for interpersonal functioning in depression and social phobia are discussed View

Rumination Scale of the Response Style Questionnaire proposed by Treynor Gonzalez and 2003 In the first part of this study we used samples of currently depressed MDD formerly depressed FD socially anxious SP and healthy control participants to examine whether the brooding and reflective pondering components differentiate participants with an anxiety disorder from participants with depression In the second part of this study we examined whether these components of rumination were differentially related to cognitive biases in depression Overall the MDD group exhibited higher brooding scores than did all other groups SP and FD groups did not differ from each other but obtained higher brooding scores than did the control participants Only the MDD and the control groups differed on the reflective pondering factor Importantly brooding and reflective pondering were differentially related to cognitive biases Specifically the correlation between pondering and memory bias was not significant when depressive symptoms were partialed out The correlation between brooding and attentional bias for sad faces however remained significant even when current depressive symptoms were taken into account In sum our results support the formulation that rumination is composed of an adaptive reflective pondering factor and a maladaptive brooding factor View details for Web of Science

emotional stimuli is poorly understood The primary goal of this study was to compare levels of activation in the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex of diagnosed depressed and nondepressed participants in response to happy and sad facial expressions of affect Whereas cognitive theories of depression predict increased activation to negative stimuli depressed participants were found to exhibit increased activation to both types of stimuli in the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex Importantly the loci were in different regions of the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex suggesting

elicited happy sad and neutral states were presented to currently depressed formerly depressed and healthy control individuals while experiential behavioral and autonomic responses were measured Currently depressed individuals reported less sadness reactivity and less happiness experience across all conditions than did the other participants and they exhibited a more dysphoric response to

whether specific symptoms are stable over time or vary over the course of the disorder This is the first longitudinal investigation examining the stability of the nine criterion symptoms of depression as specified in the among diagnosed depressed adults who were not recovered at In this study participants were assessed twice ten months apart with the structured clinical interview for and stability of the nine criterion symptoms of MDD was examined Findings indicate strong stability in individuals symptom profiles Among individuals who were clinically depressed at both assessments there were no statistically significant fluctuations in specific symptoms endorsed Changes in symptom endorsement among individuals who no longer met diagnostic criteria for MDD at Time 2 were attributable to reduced severity number of symptoms rather than to inconsistency of symptom endorsement These results indicate that depressed individuals experience essentially the same pattern of specific symptoms over the course of a year Variation in clinical course is likely to be attributable more to fluctuations in overall severity than to changes in specific symptoms of depression View details for DOI

etiological significance of autobiographical memories outside the paradigm the authors used an idiographic interview in which depressed participants generated memories of their happiest and saddest

JOURNAL OF CHILD PSYCHOLOGY AND PSYCHIATRY Gotlib Traill Montoya Joormann Chang 2005 46 1 Abstract Although children of bipolar parents are at heightened risk for developing emotional disorders the processes underlying this vulnerability are not well understood This study examined biases in the processing of emotional stimuli as a potential vulnerability marker of bipolar children of bipolar parents who did not show any indication of having an emotional disorder at the time of testing and ten children of control parents underwent a negative mood induction designed to activate cognitive schemas and were then administered an emotion Stroop task and a encoding of bipolar parents were found to exhibit an attentional bias towards and words Furthermore although and children did not differ in their endorsement of positive and negative words as the children demonstrated better recall of negative words than did the children without a mood disorder who are at high risk for developing a mood disorder were found to exhibit biases in attention and memory that are similar to those found for bipolar and unipolar depressed adults suggesting that children at increased risk for affective

RESEARCH Goodwin Gotlib 2004 126 2 Abstract The goal of the study was to determine the association between gender and the Big Five personality factors and to identify the role of personality factors in the association between gender and depression among adults in the United States Data were drawn from the Midlife Development in the United States Survey Multivariate analysis of variance MANOVA was used to examine gender differences on the Big Five personality factors agreeableness neuroticism openness to experience extraversion and conscientiousness Multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted to examine the relation between gender and depression and to test whether this association is moderated by neuroticism Levels of neuroticism agreeableness extraversion and conscientiousness were significantly higher among females than among males in contrast level of openness to experience was significantly higher among males Female gender was associated with increased odds of experiencing depression Results showed that neuroticism played a significant contributory role in the relationship between being female and major depression though the role of gender remained statistically significant after adjustment These data suggest that gender differences in personality factors specifically neuroticism may play a key role in the gender difference in depression Our findings indicate that neuroticism may moderate the association between female gender and increased risk of depression among adults These findings require replication using longitudinal data View

Abstract Recent reviews of cognitive theories of depression have noted that individualized assessment strategies might help to resolve mixed findings regarding the stability of depressotypic beliefs and attitudes We describe encouraging results for an individualized measure of one such cognitive construct irrational beliefs Twenty women recurrent major depressives in full remission and twenty closely matched controls completed leading measures of irrational beliefs the Belief Scale BS and The Revised Personal Style Inventory as well as the Specific Demands on Self Scale SDS The BS requires participants to rate their agreement with twenty preselected statements of irrational beliefs while the SDS focuses on whether participants harbor any strongly held irrational beliefs even if uncommon or idiosyncratic Consistent with previous research there were no group differences on the traditional measure of irrational beliefs In contrast participants strongly exceeded controls on the SDS and this difference persisted after controlling for residual depression anxiety symptoms anxiety diagnoses sociotropy and autonomy These findings provide some initial support for a key assumption of the model of depression and more broadly suggest that individualized assessment strategies may help researchers capture the core negative beliefs of asymptomatic individuals even in the absence of mood or

emotion regulatory capacity To examine RSA in depressed and nondepressed participants in the context of an challenge we presented a sad film to induce crying a behavior associated with heightened parasympathetic activation We predicted that nondepressed persons who cried would show elevations in RSA during the onset and the resolution of crying By contrast we predicted that depressed individuals who cried would fail to exhibit increased RSA over the course of their crying episodes As hypothesized nondepressed participants exhibited RSA increases that accompanied the resolution of tearful crying consistent with a homeostatic function for crying whereas depressed subjects who cried did not exhibit increased RSA Results suggest that the physiological mechanisms invoked by crying

widespread role in modulating an organism vigilance level To further explore this theory the amygdalar response to happy sad angry fearful and neutral faces in 17 subjects was characterized using 3 T fMRI Utilizing a random effects model and analytic strategy it was observed that each of the four emotional faces was associated with reliable bilateral activation of the amygdala compared with

some of whom did not n From the theories of Teasdale 1983 1988 and Post 1992 concerning the etiology of initial versus recurrent episodes of depression the authors hypothesized that a dysphoric mood and dysfunctional thinking styles would be correlated more highly among those with a previous history of MDD than among those without a history of MDD b dysphoric mood or symptoms and dysfunctional thinking would be a stronger predictor of onset of recurrent episodes n 43 than of first onsets n 70 and c major life stress would be a stronger predictor of first onsets of MDD than of recurrent

Finally high levels of depressive symptoms were associated with increased use of both mental and physical health care resources among boys and correlates of depression in this adolescent sample closely resemble those seen in adult samples including demographic and psychosocial variables Some psychosocial variables such as stress and social support may have a greater impact on depressive

PSYCHOLOGY Lewinsohn Gotlib Lewinsohn Seeley Allen B 1998 107 1 Abstract Gender differences in anxiety were examined in a large sample of adolescents that included who had never met criteria for any disorder 95 who had recovered from an anxiety disorder and 47 who had a current anxiety disorder Participants were examined on a wide array of psychosocial measures There was a preponderance of females among current and recovered anxiety disorder cases but not among those who had never experienced an anxiety disorder The female preponderance emerges early in life and retrospective data indicate that at age 6 females are already twice as likely to have experienced an anxiety disorder than are males Psychosocial variables that were correlated with both anxiety and gender were identified Statistically controlling for these variables did not eliminate the gender differences in prevalence or anxiety symptom means View details for Web of Science ID 000072029400010 View details

Gotlib 1997 106 4 Abstract Recent studies have found that temporal variability and reactivity in SE are associated with risk for depressive symptoms subsequent to life stress It is unclear however whether it is variability uniquely in SE that is critical or whether variability in other domains such as specific SSE and affect would show similar effects Further the specificity of these effects to depression is unknown In the present study initially nondepressed women completed 7 daily ratings of SE SSE and affect Over a prospective interval the interactions of stressful life events and variability in both SE and SSE predicted changes in depression particularly in individuals with more severe worst lifetime episodes of depressive symptoms These effects were independent of average level of SE and SSE as well as neuroticism and uncertainty In contrast variability in affect failed to predict changes in depression in interaction with life stress Finally none of the predictor variables interacted with stressful life events in predicting changes in anxiety View details for Web of Science ID A1997YD32900003 View details for PubMedID 9358682 Cognitive biases and affect

adolescents JOURNAL OF ABNORMAL PSYCHOLOGY Lewinsohn Gotlib Seeley 1997 106 3 Abstract Although the psychosocial difficulties associated with adolescent depression are relatively well known the extent to which these problems are specific to depression has received little attention The authors examined the specificity to depression of a wide range of psychosocial variables in the following 3 groups of adolescents depressed cases n 48 nonaffective disorder cases n 92 and never mentally ill participants n The authors found 3 of the 44 variables assessed in this study to be strongly specific to depression and only the depressed participants exhibited more problematic functioning than did the never mentally ill controls Three variables are as follows and a reduction in activities because of physical illness or injury Eight variables were more strongly associated with depression than with nonaffective disorder and 8 variables characterized both depressed and nonaffective disorder adolescents Implications of these findings for psychosocial theories of depression are discussed View details for Web of Science ID A1997XM16100002 View details for PubMedID 9241938 Lifetime episodes

for lifetime episodes of dysphoria were examined in a large sample of college students N 557 Dysphoria classifications were based on the Inventory to Diagnose Depression IDD and the Version Brief dysphoria was defined as meeting symptom criteria for major depression without meeting the duration criteria whereas protracted dysphoria required that the duration criteria were also met Although females reported higher levels of depressive symptoms and neuroticism than did males and were more likely to have a lifetime history of episodes of dysphoria males were more susceptible to the adverse effects of early childhood loss Males with loss were more likely to have a history of protracted dysphoria and to report higher levels of neuroticism than were males who did not experience an early parental loss Neuroticism in turn acted as a trait vulnerability characteristic to episodes of dysphoria in both males and females Interestingly the effects of gender on lifetime experience of dysphoria were mediated by neuroticism females increased vulnerability to episodes of dysphoria was due to their elevated levels of neuroticism View details for Web of Science ID A1997WZ72700003 View

attitudes and low Results from the three studies were consistent with a mediation model This model suggests that insecure adult attachment styles are associated with dysfunctional attitudes which in turn predispose to lower levels of Such depletions in are directly associated with increases in depressive symptoms over time Insecure attachment appears to lead to depressive symptoms in adulthood

wide array of psychosocial risk factors in older adolescents aged 14 through 18 years and psychosocial assessments were conducted with randomly selected high school students at T1 and after approximately 1 year T2 Three diagnostic groups were compared those who had an episode of MDD during that year n 90 those who had an episode of substance use disorder during that year SUD n 42 and a control group with no disorder n factors specific to MDD were stress minor and major events emotional reliance physical symptoms and disease history of suicide attempt and a past episode of depression or anxiety disorder Risk factors specific to SUD were tobacco use academic difficulties and a past episode of SUD Risk factors that were shared were current depression symptoms internalizing and externalizing behavior problems coping skills interpersonal conflict with parents and dissatisfaction with determining the number of risk factors for MDD for SUD or those that are general to both disorders clinicians can make informed predictions concerning the probable future onset of a episode of MDD SUD in individual cases The results of this study allow for the identification of adolescents who are at elevated risk for MDD and SUD The results also have implications for the design of interventions aimed at preventing the occurrence of these disorders Such interventions should

unipolar depression is as high in adolescents as it is in adults relatively little is known about the applicability of cognitive theories of depression to adolescents The present study examined the nature specificity and stability of cognitive dysfunction in male and female depressed remitted and psychiatric control adolescents Factor analysis of a diverse set of measures yielded two factors labelled Negative Cognitions and Attributional Style Scores on both these factors were related to a current diagnosis of depression Results also indicated that there may not be complete recovery of cognitive functioning or of depressed mood with diagnostic remission of depression Finally whereas elevated scores on the Negative Cognitions factor appeared to be specific to depression the depressed and psychiatric control adolescents did not differ with respect to their scores on the Attributional Style factor View details for Web of Science ID A1993MF71900014 View details for PubMedID 8282931
