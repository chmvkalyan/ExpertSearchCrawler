eukaryotic chromosomes Our primary focus is on elucidating the events required for orderly segregation of homologous chromosomes during meiosis the crucial process by which diploid germ cells generate haploid gametes These events are of central importance to sexually reproducing organisms since errors in meiosis lead to chromosomal aneuploidy one of the leading causes of miscarriages and birth defects in germ cells face several major challenges on the road to reducing their ploidy to generate haploid gametes 1 Chromosomes must locate identify and align with their appropriate homologous pairing partners 2 Chromosomes must acquire a structural organization that will promote controlled breakage of DNA molecules and subsequent recombinational repair using the homologous chromosome as a repair partner to yield interhomolog crossovers 3 Chromosomes must couple the events of recombination with further structural reorganization to yield an organization in which homologs are connected by chiasmata yet oriented away from each other in a way that promotes their attachment to and segregation toward opposite poles of the meiosis I spindle Moreover the connections afforded by chiasmata must be coupled with a loss of cohesion such that partial loss of cohesion occurs at meiosis I to permit dissolution of chiasmata and homolog separation while maintaining the connections between sisters required to permit bipolar attachment on the meiosis II spindle 4 During oocyte meiosis a bipolar spindle must be assembled and function without the aid of centrosomes All of these events must be tightly coordinated to achieve a successful outcome Despite the fundamental importance of meiosis the mechanisms underlying many key events remain poorly understood We are approaching the study of meiosis using the nematode elegans a simple metazoan that is especially amenable to combining genetic genomic and cytological approaches in a single system and in which the events of meiosis are particularly accessible The germ line accounts for more than half of the cell nuclei in the adult worm with nuclei in all stages of meiosis present simultaneously in a gradient along the axis of the gonad so that each gonad represents a complete meiotic time course These features facilitate visualizing chromosome organization using microscopic imaging in the context of intact 3D nuclear under

members couple formation and repair of meiotic DSBs PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA Girard Roelens Zawadzki Villeneuve 2018 115 19 Abstract Faithful inheritance of genetic information through sexual reproduction relies on the formation of crossovers between homologous chromosomes during meiosis which in turn relies on the formation and repair of numerous breaks DSBs As DSBs pose a potential threat to the genome mechanisms that ensure timely and DSB repair are crucial for successful meiosis Here we identify the Caenorhabditis elegans ortholog of the NBS1 mutated in Nijmegen Breakage Syndrome subunit of the conserved MRN complex as a key mediator of DSB repair via homologous recombination HR during meiosis Loss of leads to severely reduced loading of recombinase ssDNA binding protein RPA and factor during meiotic prophase progression aggregated and fragmented chromosomes at the end of meiotic prophase and 100 progeny lethality These phenotypes reflect a role for in processing of meiotic DSBs for HR that is shared with its interacting partners and ortholog of Unexpectedly in contrast to and is not required for meiotic DSB formation Meiotic defects of the mutant are partially suppressed by abrogation of the nonhomologous NHEJ pathway indicating a role for in antagonizing NHEJ during meiosis Our data further reveal that and play distinct roles in promoting HR and antagonizing NHEJ We propose a model in which different components of the complex work together to couple meiotic DSB formation with efficient and timely engagement of HR thereby ensuring crossover formation and restoration of genome integrity before the meiotic divisions View details for PubMedID 29686104 Dynamic Architecture of DNA Repair Complexes and the Synaptonemal Complex at Sites of Meiotic Recombination Cell Woglar Villeneuve 2018 Abstract Meiotic breaks DSBs are generated and repaired in a highly regulated manner to ensure formation of crossovers COs while also enabling efficient repair to restore genome integrity We use microscopy to investigate the dynamic architecture of DSB repair complexes at meiotic recombination sites in relationship to the synaptonemal complex SC DSBs resected atboth ends are converted into repair intermediates harboring two populations of BLM helicase and RPA flanking a single population of MutSgamma These intermediates accumulate until late pachytene when repair proteins disappear from sites and sites become enveloped by region proteins acquire a second MutSgamma population and lose RPA These and other data suggest that the SC may protect COintermediates from being dismantled inappropriately and promote CO maturation by generating a transient repair compartment thereby enabling differential timing and outcome of repair at CO and sites View details for PubMedID 29754818 Meiotic recombination modulates the structure and dynamics of the synaptonemal complex during elegans meiosis PLOS GENETICS Pattabiraman Roelens Woglar Villeneuve 2017 13 3 Abstract During meiotic prophase a structure called the synaptonemal complex SC assembles at the interface between aligned pairs of homologous chromosomes and crossover recombination events occur between their DNA molecules Here we investigate the between these two hallmark features of the meiotic program in the nematode elegans revealing dynamic properties of the SC that are modulated by recombination We demonstrate that the SC incorporates new subunits and switches from a more highly state to a more stable state as germ cells progress through the pachytene stage of meiotic prophase We further show that the more dynamic state of the SC is prolonged in mutants where meiotic recombination is impaired Moreover in meiotic mutants where recombination intermediates are present in limiting numbers SC central region subunits become preferentially stabilized on the subset of chromosome pairs that harbor a site where factors and MutSγ are concentrated kinase becomes preferentially localized to the SCs of chromosome pairs harboring recombination sites prior to the enrichment of SC central region proteins on such chromosomes and is required for this enrichment to occur Further late pachytene nuclei in a mutant exhibit the more highly dynamic SC state Together our data demonstrate that crossover recombination events elicit stabilizing effects on the SC and implicate in this process We discuss how this modulation of SC state might contribute to regulatory mechanisms that operate during meiosis to ensure the formation of crossovers while at the same time limiting their numbers View details for DOI View details for Web of Science ID 000398043000023 View details for PubMedID 28339470 Meiotic chromosome structures constrain and respond to designation of crossover sites Nature Libuda Uzawa Meyer Villeneuve 2013 502 7473 Abstract Crossover recombination events between homologous chromosomes are required to form chiasmata temporary connections between homologues that ensure their proper segregation at meiosis I Despite this requirement for crossovers and an excess of the DNA breaks that are the initiating events for meiotic recombination most organisms make very few crossovers per chromosome pair Moreover crossovers tend to inhibit the formation of other crossovers nearby on the same chromosome pair a poorly understood phenomenon known as crossover interference Here we show that the synaptonemal complex a structure that assembles between aligned homologous chromosomes both constrains and is altered by crossover recombination events Using a cytological marker of crossover sites in Caenorhabditis elegans we show that partial depletion of the synaptonemal complex central region proteins attenuates crossover interference increasing crossovers and reducing the effective distance over which interference operates indicating that synaptonemal complex proteins limit crossovers Moreover we show that crossovers are associated with a local increase in chromosome axis length We propose that meiotic crossover regulation operates as a system in which meiotic chromosome structures establish an environment that promotes crossover formation which in turn alters chromosome structure to inhibit other crossovers at additional sites View details for DOI View details for

further suggest a mechanism maintaining CO designation Modeling of a nonlinear relationship between DSBs and foci reveals efficient conversion of DSBs into COs when DSBs are limiting and a robust capacity to limit cytologically differentiated CO sites when DSBs are in excess foci serve as a unique live cell readout for investigating CO formation and CO interference View details for DOI View

Pairing and Synapsis in Caenorhabditis elegans GENETICS Villeneuve 2017 207 1 Abstract Segregation of homologous chromosomes during meiosis depends on their ability to reorganize within the nucleus discriminate among potential partners and stabilize pairwise associations through assembly of the synaptonemal complex SC Here we report a analysis of these key early events during Caenorhabditis elegans meiosis Labeled nucleotides are incorporated specifically into the X chromosomes during the last 2 hr of S phase a property we exploit to identify a highly synchronous cohort of nuclei By tracking nuclei through early meiotic prophase we define the sequence and duration of chromosome movement nuclear reorganization pairing at pairing centers PCs and SC assembly Appearance of foci marking attachment of PCs to the nuclear envelope and onset of active mobilization occur within an hour after completion Movement occurs for nearly 2 hr before stable pairing is observed at PCs and autosome movement continues for hr thereafter Chromosomes are tightly clustered during a hr postpairing window during which the bulk of SC assembly occurs however initiation of SC assembly can precede evident chromosome clustering SC assembly on autosomes begins immediately after PC pairing is detected and is completed within hr For the X chromosomes PC pairing is contemporaneous with autosomal pairing but autosomes complete synapsis earlier on average than X chromosomes implying that X chromosomes have a delay in onset a slower rate of SC assembly Additional evidence suggests that transient association among chromosomes sharing the same PC protein may contribute to partner discrimination View details for PubMedID 28710064 View details for PubMedCentralID PMC5586365 Assembly of Caenorhabditis elegans acentrosomal spindles occurs without evident centers and requires microtubule sorting by and MOLECULAR BIOLOGY OF THE CELL Wolff Tran Mullen Villeneuve Wignall 2016 27 20 Abstract Although centrosomes contribute to spindle formation in most cell types oocytes of many species are acentrosomal and must organize spindles in their absence Here we investigate this process in Caenorhabditis elegans detailing how acentrosomal spindles form and revealing mechanisms required to establish bipolarity Using imaging we find that in meiosis I microtubules initially form a structure inside the disassembling nuclear envelope This structure reorganizes so that minus ends are sorted to the periphery of the array forming multiple nascent poles that then coalesce until bipolarity is achieved In meiosis II microtubules nucleate in the vicinity of chromosomes but then undergo similar sorting and pole formation events We further show that and previously shown to be required for spindle bipolarity likely contribute to bipolarity by sorting microtubules After their depletion minus ends are not sorted outward at the early stages of spindle assembly and instead converge These proteins colocalize on microtubules are interdependent for localization and can interact suggesting that they work together We propose that and form a complex that functions to sort microtubules of mixed polarity into a configuration in which minus ends are away from the chromosomes enabling formation of nascent poles View details for DOI View details for PubMedID 27559133 A

valuable foundation for understanding of nuclear architecture and function and a valuable tool for inferring linkage relationships As one approach to this chromatin conformation techniques allow creation of genome spatial organization maps While such approaches have been available for some time methodological advances will be of considerable use in minimizing both time and input material required for successful we report a modified tethered conformation capture protocol that utilizes a series of rapid and efficient molecular manipulations We applied the method to Caenorhabditis elegans obtaining chromatin interaction maps that provide a delineation of salient aspects of Caenorhabditis elegans chromosome structure demonstrating a high level of consistency in overall chromosome organization between biological samples collected under different conditions In addition to the application of the method to defining nuclear architecture we found the resulting chromatin interaction maps to be of sufficient resolution and sensitivity to enable detection of structural variants such as inversions or streamlined protocol provides an accelerated robust and broadly

Abstract During the first meiotic division crossovers COs between homologous chromosomes ensure their correct segregation COs are produced by homologous recombination HR repair of programmed DNA double strand breaks DSBs As more DSBs are induced than COs mechanisms are required to establish a regulated number of COs and to repair remaining intermediates as NCOs We show that the Caenorhabditis

Karyotype in Caenorhabditis elegans Reveals Multiple Inputs Driving Pairwise Chromosome Synapsis During Meiosis Genetics Roelens Schvarzstein Villeneuve 2015 201 4 Abstract Meiotic chromosome segregation requires pairwise association between homologs stabilized by the synaptonemal complex SC Here we investigate factors contributing to pairwise synapsis by investigating meiosis in polyploid worms We devised a strategy based on transient inhibition of cohesin function to generate polyploid derivatives of virtually any Caenorhabditis elegans strain We exploited this strategy to investigate the contribution of recombination to pairwise synapsis in tetraploid and triploid worms In otherwise polyploids chromosomes first sort into homolog groups then multipartner interactions mature into exclusive pairwise associations Pairwise synapsis associations still form in tetraploids confirming a propensity for synapsis to occur in a strictly pairwise manner However the transition from multipartner to pairwise association was perturbed in triploids implying a role for recombination in promoting this transition when three partners compete for synapsis To evaluate the basis of synapsis partner preference we generated polyploid worms heterozygous for normal sequence and rearranged chromosomes sharing the same pairing center PC Tetraploid worms had no detectable preference for identical partners indicating that homology drives partner choice in this context In contrast triploid worms exhibited a clear preference for identical partners indicating that homology outside the PC region can influence partner choice Together our findings suggest a model for elegans synapsis an early phase in which initial synapsis interactions are driven primarily by assessment of homology near PCs and by a propensity for pairwise SC assembly and a later phase in which mature synaptic interactions are promoted by recombination View details for DOI View details for PubMedID

crossovers COs which mature into chiasmata that temporarily connect the homologs to ensure their proper segregation at meiosis I The remaining DSBs must be repaired by other mechanisms to restore

crossover maturation and deselection of excess precrossover sites journal of cell biology Holloway Sun Yokoo Villeneuve Cohen 2014 205 5 Abstract Meiotic crossovers COs are crucial for ensuring accurate homologous chromosome segregation during meiosis I Because the breaks DSBs that initiate meiotic recombination greatly outnumber eventual COs this process requires exquisite regulation to narrow down the pool of DSB intermediates that may form COs In this paper we identify a protein CNTD1 as a critical mediator of this process Disruption of Cntd1 results in failure to localize factors MutLγ and HEI10 at designated CO sites and also leads to prolonged high levels of intermediates marked by MutSγ and RNF212 These data show that maturation of COs is intimately coupled to deselection of excess sites to yield a limited number of COs and that CNTD1 coordinates these processes by regulating the association between the RING finger proteins HEI10 and RNF212 and components of the CO machinery View details for DOI View details for PubMedID 24891606 View details for PubMedCentralID PMC4050721 Evidence that masking of synapsis imperfections counterbalances quality control to promote efficient meiosis PLoS genetics Roelens Villeneuve 2013 9 12 Abstract Reduction in ploidy to generate haploid gametes during sexual reproduction is accomplished by the specialized cell division program of meiosis Pairing between homologous chromosomes and assembly of the synaptonemal complex at their interface synapsis represent intermediate steps in the meiotic program that are essential to form crossover linkages between homologs which in turn enable segregation of the homologs to opposite poles at the meiosis I division Here we challenge the mechanisms of pairing and synapsis during elegans meiosis by disrupting the normal correspondence between homologs through karyotype manipulation Using a combination of cytological tools including labeling to specifically identify X chromosome territories in highly synchronous cohorts of nuclei and 3D rendering to visualize meiotic chromosome structures and organization our analysis of trisomic and polyploid meiosis provides insight into the principles governing pairing and synapsis and how the meiotic program is wired to maximize successful sexual reproduction We show that chromosomes sort into homologous groups regardless of chromosome number then preferentially achieve pairwise synapsis during a period of active chromosome mobilization Further comparisons of synapsis configurations in germ cells that are proficient or defective for initiating recombination suggest a role for recombination in restricting chromosomal interactions to a pairwise state Increased numbers of homologs prolong markers of the chromosome mobilization phase boost germline apoptosis consistent with triggering quality control mechanisms that promote resolution of synapsis problems cull meiocytes containing synapsis defects However we also uncover evidence for the existence of mechanisms that mask defects thus allowing resumption of prophase progression and survival of germ cells despite some asynapsis We propose that coupling of saturable masking mechanisms with stringent quality controls maximizes meiotic success by making progression and survival dependent on achieving a level of synapsis sufficient for crossover formation without requiring perfect synapsis View details for DOI View details for PubMedID 24339786 View details for PubMedCentralID PMC3854781 Evidence that masking of synapsis

9 8 Abstract Meiotic recombination an essential aspect of sexual reproduction is initiated by programmed DNA breaks DSBs DSBs are catalyzed by the Spo11 enzyme however the activity of Spo11 is regulated by additional factors that are poorly conserved through evolution To expand our understanding of meiotic regulation we have characterized a novel gene that is specifically required for meiotic DSB formation in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans localizes to chromosomes during early meiotic prophase coincident with the timing of DSB formation also promotes normal protein levels and chromosome localization of a paralogous protein that plays a related role in initiating recombination Mutations that disrupt crossover formation result in prolonged association with chromosomes suggesting that nuclei may remain in a state Extended localization is seen even in mutants with defects in early recombination steps including suggesting that the absence of crossover precursors triggers the extension Strikingly failure to form a crossover precursor on a single chromosome pair is sufficient to extend the localization of on all chromosomes in the same nucleus Based on these observations we propose a model for crossover assurance that acts through to maintain a state until all chromosome pairs acquire crossover precursors This work identifies a novel component of the DSB

Flibotte Taylor Moerman Villeneuve 2013 9 5 Abstract Pairing of homologous chromosomes during early meiosis is essential to prevent the formation of aneuploid gametes Chromosome pairing includes a step of homology search followed by the stabilization of homolog interactions by the synaptonemal complex SC These events coincide with dramatic changes in nuclear organization and rapid chromosome movements that depend on cytoskeletal motors and are mediated by proteins on the nuclear envelope but how chromosome mobility contributes to the pairing process remains poorly understood We show that defects in the protein cause a defect in homolog pairing without impairing nuclear reorganization or SC assembly which results in promiscuous installation of the SC between chromosomes Preventing SC assembly in mutants does not improve homolog pairing demonstrating that is required for homology search at the start of meiosis Pairing center regions localize to aggregates at meiosis onset in mutants and proteins including cytoskeletal motors and kinase 2 are normally recruited to the nuclear envelope However quantitative analysis of aggregate movement in mutants demonstrates a clear reduction in mobility although this defect is not as severe as that seen in jf18 mutants which also show a stronger pairing defect suggesting a correlation between mobility and the efficiency of pairing aggregate movement is also impaired following inhibition of mitochondrial respiration or dynein knockdown suggesting that mitochondrial function is required for movement The reduced mobility of mutants impairs coupling of SC assembly to homology recognition and causes a delay in meiotic progression mediated by protein Our work reveals how chromosome mobility impacts the different early meiotic events that promote homolog pairing and suggests that efficient homology search at the onset of meiosis is largely dependent on chromosome movement View details for DOI View details for

contribute both genetic material and centriole s to the zygote Correct centriole organization during male meiosis is critical to guarantee a normal bipolar mitotic spindle in the zygote During Caenorhabditis elegans male meiosis centrioles normally undergo two rounds of duplication resulting in haploid sperm each containing a single tightly engaged centriole pair Here we identify an unanticipated role for elegans HORMA domain proteins and in regulating centriole disengagement during spermatocyte meiosis In and mutants centrioles separate inappropriately during meiosis II resulting in spermatids with disengaged centrioles Moreover extra centrosomes are detected in a subset of zygotes Together these data implicate and in preventing centriole disengagement during meiosis

or expressing a mutant separase protein with elevated local concentration at centrosomes and in sperm likewise exhibit inappropriate centriole separation during spermatocyte meiosis These observations are consistent with and preventing centriole disengagement by inhibiting cohesin removal Our data suggest that the same specialized meiotic mechanisms that function to prevent premature release of sister chromatid cohesion during meiosis I in elegans also function to inhibit centriole separation at meiosis II thereby ensuring that the zygote inherits the appropriate complement of chromosomes

organisms chromosome segregation during meiosis relies on deliberate induction of DNA breaks DSBs and repair of a subset of these DSBs as crossovers COs However timing and levels of DSB formation must be tightly controlled to avoid jeopardizing genome integrity Here we identify the protein which is required for efficient DSB formation during elegans meiosis but is dispensable for later steps of meiotic recombination localizes to chromatin during the time of DSB formation and its disappearance coincides with a decline in foci marking early recombination intermediates and precedes appearance of foci marking sites These and other data suggest that and its paralog promote competence for DSB formation Further immunofluorescence analyses of gonads and various meiotic mutants reveal that association of with chromatin is coordinated with multiple distinct aspects of the meiotic program including the phosphorylation state of nuclear envelope protein and dependence on to load the recombinase at DSB sites Moreover association of with chromatin is prolonged in mutants impaired for either DSB formation or formation of downstream CO intermediates These and other data suggest that association of with chromatin is an indicator of competence for DSB formation and that cells respond to a deficit of recombination intermediates by prolonging the state In the context of this model we propose that formation of sufficient intermediates engages a negative feedback response that leads to cessation of DSB formation as part of a major coordinated transition in meiotic prophase progression The proposed negative feedback regulation of DSB formation simultaneously 1 ensures that sufficient DSBs are made to guarantee CO formation and 2 prevents excessive DSB levels that could

assembly was initially revealed through identification of the component as a factor promoting stable homolog pairing Using an assay system that monitors homolog pairing in vivo we showed that depletion of at disrupts homolog pairing Analysis of homolog pairing at other chromosomal loci in a null mutant revealed a pairing defect similar to that observed in mutants lacking SC central region components Further loss of function at temperatures results in severe impairment in loading of SC central region component onto chromosomes resulting in formation of aggregates SC assembly is also temperature sensitive in worms which exhibit similar loading defects and formation of aggregates at temperatures Temperature shift analyses suggest that assembly of the SC is temperature sensitive but maintenance of the SC is not We suggest that the ts nature of SC assembly may contribute to fitness and adaptation capacity in elegans by enabling meiotic disruption in response to environmental

distribution of interhomolog crossover recombination events Despite its involvement in dynamic chromosome behaviors such as homolog pairing and recombination the extent to which SC once installed acts as an irreversible tether or maintains the capacity to remodel is not clear Experiments presented here reveal insight into the dynamics of the SC in budding yeast meiotic cells We demonstrate that Zip1 continually incorporates into previously assembled synaptonemal complex during meiotic prophase Moreover Zip1 incorporation is sufficient to rescue the sporulation defect triggered by SCs built with a mutant version of Zip1 Zip1 incorporation occurs initially with a spatial distribution predominantly associated with Zip3 a component of the synapsis initiation complex that is presumed to mark a subset of crossover sites A dynamic architecture of the SC is observed independently of i synapsis initiation components ii the Pch2 and Pph3 proteins that have been linked to Zip1 regulation and iii the presence of a homolog Finally the rate of SC assembly and SC central region size increase in proportion to Zip1 copy number this and other observations suggest that Zip1 does not exit the SC structure to the same extent that it enters Our observations suggest that after assembly SC central region exhibits little global turnover but maintains differential assembly dynamics at sites whose

Caenorhabditis elegans Meiosis by Antagonizing Inhibitory Effects of Synaptonemal Complex Precursors PLOS GENETICS Zhang Miley Zastrow MacQueen Sato Nabeshima Carlton Villeneuve 2012 8 8 Abstract During meiosis chromosomes align with their homologous pairing partners and stabilize this alignment through assembly of the synaptonemal complex SC Since the SC assembles cooperatively yet is indifferent to homology pairing and SC assembly must be tightly coordinated We identify as a key mediator in this coordination showing that promotes pairing largely by preventing detrimental effects of SC precursors SYP proteins mutants fail to establish pairing and lack multiple markers of chromosome movement mediated by pairing centers PCs chromosome sites that link chromosomes to cytoplasmic microtubules through nuclear complexes Moreover SYP proteins load inappropriately along individual unpaired chromosomes in mutants and markers of movement and function are restored in syp double mutants These and other data indicate that SYP proteins can impede pairing and that promotes pairing predominantly but not exclusively by counteracting this inhibition thereby enabling activation and regulation of PC function concentrates in the germ cell nucleoplasm and colocalizes with SYP proteins in nuclear aggregates when SC assembly is prevented We propose that functions to shepherd SYP proteins prior to licensing of SC assembly preventing untimely interactions between SC precursors and chromosomes and allowing sufficient accumulation of precursors for rapid cooperative assembly upon

and Regulated Interhomolog Access Maintain Meiotic Crossover Number SCIENCE Rosu Libuda Villeneuve 2011 334 6060 Abstract Most organisms rely on interhomolog crossovers COs to ensure proper meiotic chromosome segregation but make few COs per chromosome pair By monitoring repair events at a defined break DSB site during Caenorhabditis elegans meiosis we reveal mechanisms that ensure formation of the obligate CO while limiting CO number We find that CO is the preferred DSB repair outcome in the absence of inhibitory effects of other nascent recombination events Thus a single DSB per chromosome pair is largely sufficient to ensure CO formation Further we show that access to the homolog as a repair template is regulated shutting down simultaneously for both CO and noncrossover NCO pathways We propose that regulation of interhomolog access limits CO number and contributes to CO interference View details for DOI View details for Web of Science ID 000297553600053 View details for PubMedID

PLOS GENETICS Nabeshima Villeneuve 2011 7 8 Abstract During early meiotic prophase a reorganization leads to sorting of chromosomes into homologous pairs and to establishing associations between homologous chromosomes along their entire lengths Here we investigate global features of chromosome organization during this process using a chromosome painting method in Caenorhabditis elegans gonads that enables visualization of whole chromosomes along their entire lengths in the context of preserved 3D nuclear architecture First we show that neither spatial proximity of premeiotic chromosome territories nor timing is a major factor driving homolog pairing Second we show that synaptonemal associations can support full lengthwise juxtaposition of homologous chromosomes Third we reveal a prominent elongation of chromosome territories during meiotic prophase that initiates prior to homolog association and alignment Mutant analysis indicates that chromosome movement mediated by association of chromosome pairing centers PCs with mobile patches of the nuclear envelope NE protein complexes is not the primary driver of territory elongation Moreover we identify new roles for the X chromosome PC and binding protein in promoting elongation of X chromosome territories separable from their role s in mediating local stabilization of pairing and association of X chromosomes with mobile patches Further we present evidence that functions both at and outside of PCs to mediate chromosome territory elongation These and other data support a model in which elongation of chromosome territories driven by PC binding proteins enables lengthwise juxtaposition of chromosomes thereby facilitating assessment of their suitability as potential pairing partners View details for DOI View

Meiosis Implications for Sex Chromosome Evolution GENETICS Henzel Nabeshima Schvarzstein Turner Villeneuve Hillers J 2011 187 3 Abstract Heteromorphic sex chromosomes such as the pair in mammals differ in size and DNA sequence yet function as homologs during meiosis this bivalent asymmetry presents special challenges for meiotic completion In Caenorhabditis elegans males carrying mnT12 an X IV fusion chromosome mnT12 and IV form an asymmetric bivalent chromosome IV sequences are capable of pairing and synapsis while the contiguous X portion of mnT12 lacks a homologous pairing partner Here we investigate the meiotic behavior of this asymmetric chromosome pair in elegans Through immunolocalization of the axis component we demonstrate that the unpaired X axis has a distinct coiled morphology while synapsed axes are linear and extended By showing that loci at the end of IV become unpaired while remaining synapsed as pachytene progresses we directly demonstrate the occurrence of synaptic adjustment in this organism We further demonstrate that meiotic crossover distribution is markedly altered in males with the asymmetric bivalent relative to controls resulting in greatly reduced crossover formation near the X IV fusion point and elevated crossovers at the distal end of the bivalent In effect the distal end of the bivalent acts as a region in these males We discuss implications of these findings for mechanisms that ensure crossover formation during meiosis Furthermore we propose that redistribution of crossovers triggered by bivalent asymmetry may be an important driving force in sex chromosome evolution View details for DOI View details for Web of Science ID 000288457800005 View details for PubMedID 21212235 Meiotic Errors Activate Checkpoints that

with the correct complement and integrity of DNA in metazoans these pathways sense errors and transduce signals to trigger apoptosis to eliminate damaged germ cells The extent to which checkpoints monitor and safeguard the genome differs between sexes and may contribute to the high frequency of human female meiotic errors In the elegans female germline DNA damage chromosome asynapsis unrepaired meiotic breaks DSBs activate checkpoints that induce apoptosis conversely male germ cells do not undergo we show that the recombination checkpoint is in fact activated in male germ cells despite the lack of apoptosis The complex and the phosphatidylinositol protein kinase ATR sensors of DNA damage are recruited to chromatin in the presence of unrepaired meiotic DSBs in both female and male germlines Furthermore the checkpoint kinase is phosphorylated and the p53 ortholog induces expression of proapoptotic proteins in germlines of both sexes under activating conditions The core cell death machinery is expressed in female and male germlines however caspase is not activated in the male germline Although apoptosis is not triggered checkpoint activation in males has functional consequences for gamete quality because there is reduced viability of progeny sired by males with a defect in the absence of checkpoint propose that the recombination checkpoint functions in male germ

Caenorhabditis elegans Meiosis GENETICS Hayashi Villeneuve 2010 186 1 Abstract The synaptonemal complex SC is a highly ordered proteinaceous structure that assembles at the interface between aligned homologous chromosomes during meiotic prophase The SC has been demonstrated to function both in stabilization of homolog pairing and in promoting the formation of interhomolog crossovers COs How the SC provides these functions and whether it also plays a role in inhibiting CO formation has been a matter of debate Here we provide new insight into assembly and function of the SC by investigating the consequences of reducing but not eliminating a major structural component of the SC central region during meiosis in Caenorhabditis elegans First we find an increased incidence of double CO DCO meiotic products following partial depletion of by RNAi indicating a role for in mechanisms that normally limit crossovers to one per homolog pair per meiosis Second RNAi worms exhibit both a strong preference for COs to occur on the left half of the X chromosome and a significant bias for protein to be associated with the left half of the chromosome implying that the SC functions locally in promoting Distribution of on chromosomes in RNAi germ cells provides strong corroboration for cooperative assembly of the SC central region and indicates that preferentially associates with X chromosomes when it is present in limiting quantities Further the observed biases in the distribution of both COs and protein support models in which synapsis initiates predominantly in the vicinity of pairing centers PCs However discontinuities in SC structure and clear gaps between localized foci of protein and X stretches allow refinement of models for the role of PCs in promoting synapsis Our data suggest that the CO landscape is shaped by a combination of three attributes of the SC central region a activity that functions locally at CO sites a cooperative assembly process that enables CO formation in regions distant from prominent sites of synapsis initiation and role s that limit CO number View details for DOI View details for Web of Science ID 000281950600005 View details for

Villeneuve 2010 24 3 Abstract Organisms that reproduce sexually must reduce their chromosome number by half during meiosis to generate haploid gametes To achieve this reduction in ploidy organisms must devise strategies to couple sister chromatids so that they stay together during the first meiotic division when homologous chromosomes separate and then segregate away from one another during the second division Here we review recent findings that shed light on how Caenorhabditis elegans an organism with holocentric chromosomes deals with these challenges of meiosis by differentiating distinct chromosomal subdomains and remodeling chromosome structure during prophase Furthermore we discuss how features of chromosome organization established during prophase affect later chromosome behavior

chromatin that modulates multiple aspects of chromosome function Methyl modification can occur on several different amino acid residues and in distinct and states However the interplay among these distinct modification states is not well understood Here we investigate the relationships between dimethyl and trimethyl modifications on lysine 9 of histone H3 H3K9me2 and H3K9me3 in the adult Caenorhabditis elegans germ line Simultaneous immunofluorescence reveals very different localization patterns for H3K9me2 and H3K9me3 While H3K9me2 is enriched on unpaired sex chromosomes and undergoes dynamic changes as germ cells progress through meiotic prophase we demonstrate here that H3K9me3 is not enriched on unpaired sex chromosomes and localizes to all chromosomes in all germ cells in adult hermaphrodites and until the primary spermatocyte stage in males Moreover transgene arrays carrying specific promoters are highly enriched for H3K9me3 but not H3K9me2 and correlate with chromatin domains We further demonstrate that the H3K9me2 and H3K9me3 marks are acquired independently a member of the SETDB histone methyltransferase HMTase family is required for all detectable germline H3K9me2 but is dispensable for H3K9me3 in adult germ cells Conversely we show that the HMTase an E z homolog responsible for H3K27 methylation in adult germ cells is required for much of the germline H3K9me3 but is dispensable for H3K9me2 Phenotypic analysis of mutants indicates that is nonessential for fertility but inhibits ectopic germ cell proliferation and contributes to the fidelity of chromosome inheritance Our demonstration of the differential localization and independent acquisition of H3K9me2 and H3K9me3 implies that the trimethyl modification of H3K9 is not built upon the

through formation of RNA duplexes Although progress has been made in identifying the capabilities of siRNAs in silencing foreign RNA and transposable elements siRNA functions in endogenous gene regulation have remained mysterious In certain organisms siRNA biosynthesis involves novel enzymes that act as RNA polymerases RdRPs Here we analyze the function of a Caenorhabditis elegans RdRP during spermatogenesis We found that loss of function resulted in pleiotropic defects in sperm development and that sperm defects led to embryonic lethality Notably sperm nuclei in mutants of either or another component of the siRNA pathway were frequently surrounded by ectopic microtubule structures with spindle abnormalities in a subset of the resulting embryos Through small RNA sequencing we identified a population of cellular mRNAs from spermatogenic cells that appear to serve as templates for antisense siRNA synthesis This set of genes includes the majority of genes known to have enriched expression during spermatogenesis as well as many genes not previously known to be expressed during spermatogenesis In a subset of these genes we found that was required for effective siRNA

BIOLOGY Wignall Villeneuve 2009 11 7 Abstract Although centrosomes serve to organize microtubules in most cell types oocyte spindles form and mediate meiotic chromosome segregation in their absence Here we used imaging of both bipolar and experimentally generated monopolar spindles in Caenorhabditis elegans to reveal a surprising organization of microtubules and chromosomes within acentrosomal structures We found that homologous chromosome pairs bivalents are surrounded by microtubule bundles running along their sides whereas microtubule density is extremely low at chromosome ends despite a high concentration of kinetochore proteins at those regions Furthermore we found that the chromokinesin protein 19 is targeted to a ring around the centre of each bivalent and provides a polar ejection force that is required for congression Together these observations create a new picture of association in acentrosomal spindles and reveal a mechanism by which metaphase alignment can be achieved using this organization Specifically we propose that ensheathment by lateral microtubule bundles places spatial constraints on the chromosomes thereby promoting biorientation and that localized motors mediate movement along these bundles thereby promoting alignment View details for DOI View details for Web of Science ID 000267603100012 View details for PubMedID 19525937 View

by crossovers and on selective release of a subset of sister chromatid cohesion at anaphase I During Caenorhabditis elegans meiosis each chromosome pair forms a single crossover and the position of this event determines which chromosomal regions will undergo cohesion release at anaphase I Here we provide insight into the basis of this coupling by uncovering a regional change in chromosome axis composition that is triggered by crossovers We show that axial element components and are removed during late pachytene in a manner from the regions that will later be targeted for anaphase I cohesion release We demonstrate correspondence in position and number between chiasmata and regions and provide evidence that depletion boundaries mark crossover sites In mutants diakinesis bivalents lack normal asymmetrical features and sister chromatid cohesion is prematurely lost during the meiotic divisions We conclude that is central to the mechanism linking crossovers with bivalent

program in Caenorhabditis elegans involves both acquisition and loss of a specialized mode of break repair DSBR In premeiotic germ cells is not required to load protein at sites of spontaneous or ionizing radiation IR DSBs A specialized meiotic DSBR mode is engaged at the onset of meiotic prophase coincident with assembly of meiotic chromosome axis structures This meiotic DSBR mode is characterized both by dependence on for rapid accumulation of at DSB sites and by competence for converting DSBs into interhomolog At the to late pachytene transition germ cells undergo an abrupt release from the meiotic DSBR mode characterized by reversion to loading of and loss of competence to convert DSBs into interhomolog COs This transition in DSBR mode is dependent on MAP prophase progression and coincides temporally with a major remodeling of chromosome architecture We propose that at least two developmentally programmed switches in DSBR mode likely conferred by changes in chromosome architecture operate in the elegans germ line to allow formation of meiotic crossovers without jeopardizing genomic integrity Our data further suggest that meiotic cohesin component may

spermiogenesis or sperm activation involves a rapid cellular morphogenesis that converts unpolarized round spermatids into polarized amoeboid spermatozoa capable of both motility and we demonstrate by genetic analysis and in vivo and in vitro assays that the temporal and spatial localization of spermiogenesis are critical determinants of male fertility in elegans a species We identify as a factor important for male but not hermaphrodite fertility We show that whereas in males activation occurs after spermatids are transferred to the hermaphrodite mutants exhibit ectopic activation of sperm

synapsis but does not support pairing stabilization indicating that these functions are separable Once initiated synapsis is highly processive even between nonhomologous chromosomes of disparate

assembly of synaptonemal complex protein along some paired chromosomes resulting in partial competence for chiasma formation We present both genetic and cytological evidence indicating that the me80

checkpoint proteins have also begun to uncover novel components of these response pathways In this chapter we will briefly review the elegans DNA field and we will discuss in detail the methods that

sexual reproduction is the reduction in chromosome number that occurs at the meiosis I division Most eukaryotes rely on crossing over between homologs and the resulting chiasmata to direct meiosis I chromosome segregation yet make very few crossovers per chromosome pair This indicates that meiotic recombination must be tightly regulated to ensure that each chromosome pair enjoys the crossover necessary to ensure correct segregation Here we investigate control of meiotic crossing over in Caenorhabditis elegans which averages only one crossover per chromosome pair per meiosis by constructing genetic maps of fusions of whole chromosomes Fusion of chromosomes removes the requirement for a crossover in each component chromosome segment and thereby reveals a propensity to restrict the number of crossovers such that pairs of fusion chromosomes composed of two or even three whole chromosomes enjoy but a single crossover in the majority of meioses This regulation can operate over physical distances encompassing half the genome The meiotic behavior of heterozygous fusion chromosomes further suggests that continuous meiotic chromosome axes or structures that depend on properly assembled axes may be important for crossover regulation View details for DOI View details for Web of Science ID 000185404800026 View details for PubMedID 13678597 Synaptonemal complex assembly in is

relationships between assembly of the synaptonemal complex SC and progression of recombination between homologous chromosomes during Caenorhabditis elegans meiosis We identify as a structural component of the SC central region and show that central region assembly depends on proper morphogenesis of chromosome axes We find that the SC central region is dispensable for initiation of recombination and for loading of DNA protein despite the fact that extensive loading normally occurs in the context of assembled SC Further persistence of foci and absence of crossover products in meiotic mutants suggests that SC central region components and recombination proteins and are required to promote conversion of resected breaks into stable exchange intermediates Our data also suggest that early prophase barriers to utilization of sister chromatids as repair templates do not depend on central region assembly View details for Web of Science ID 000185309600014 View details for

is for the discovery of new genes with similar function to a given list of genes the query already known to have closely related function We have developed an algorithm called the gene recommender that ranks genes according to how strongly they correlate with a set of query genes in those experiments for which the query genes are most strongly coregulated We used the gene recommender to find other genes coexpressed with several sets of query genes including genes known to function in the retinoblastoma complex Genetic experiments confirmed that one gene identified by the gene recommender acts with Rb to regulate vulval cell fates and that another gene acts antagonistically We find that the gene recommender returns lists of genes with better precision for fixed levels of recall than lists generated using the elegans expression topomap View details for DOI View details for Web of Science ID 000184530900005 View details for PubMedID 12902378 View details for PubMedCentralID PMC403774 and mechanisms stabilize homolog pairing during meiotic prophase in GENES DEVELOPMENT MacQueen Colaiacovo McDonald Villeneuve 2002 16 18 Abstract Analysis of Caenorhabditis elegans mutants reveals that both and mechanisms contribute to stable productive alignment of homologous chromosomes during meiotic prophase Early prophase nuclei undergo normal reorganization in mutants and chromosomes initially pair However the polarized nuclear organization characteristic of early prophase persists for a prolonged period and homologs dissociate prematurely furthermore the synaptonemal complex SC is absent The predicted structure of its localization at the interface between intimately paired pachytene homologs and its kinetics of localization with chromosomes indicate that is an SC structural component A severe reduction in crossing over together with evidence for accumulated recombination intermediates in mutants indicate that initial pairing is not sufficient for completion of exchange and implicates the SC in promoting crossover recombination Persistence of polarized nuclear organization in mutants suggests that SC polymerization may provide a motive force or signal that drives redispersal of chromosomes Whereas our analysis suggests that the SC is required to stabilize pairing along the entire lengths of chromosomes striking differences in peak pairing levels for opposite ends of chromosomes in mutants reveal the existence of an additional mechanism that can promote local stabilization of pairing independent of synapsis View details for DOI View details for

involved in chromosome morphogenesis and nuclear organization during meiotic prophase in the Caenorhabditis elegans germline This approach took advantage of a survey that used DNA microarray technology to identify genes preferentially expressed in the germline We defined a subset of 192 genes whose expression profiles were similar to those of previously identified meiosis genes and designed a screen to identify genes for which inhibition by RNA interference RNAi elicited defects in function or development of the germline We obtained strong germline phenotypes for 27 of the genes tested indicating that this targeted approach greatly enriched for genes that function in the germline In addition to genes involved in key meiotic prophase events we identified genes involved in

Analysis of mutants defective in meiotic chromosome pairing has uncovered a role for Caenorhabditis elegans in initial establishment of pairing between homologous chromosomes during early meiotic prophase is also required for the major spatial reorganization of nuclei that normally accompanies the onset of pairing suggesting a mechanistic coupling of these two events Despite failures in pairing nuclear reorganization and crossover recombination mutants undergo many other aspects of meiotic chromosome morphogenesis and complete gametogenesis Although encodes a elegans ortholog of the checkpoint protein kinases nuclei in mutants are competent to arrest proliferation in response to replication inhibition and to trigger DNA damage checkpoint responses to ionizing radiation However mutants are defective in triggering the pachytene DNA damage checkpoint in response to an intermediate block in the meiotic recombination pathway suggesting that is required either for initiation of meiotic recombination or for monitoring a specific subset of DNA damage lesions We propose that functions during premeiotic S phase to enable chromosomes to become competent for subsequent meiotic

integrity Although yeast Mre11 is known to promote genome stability through several diverse pathways inviability of vertebrate cells that lack Mre11 has hindered elucidation of the in vivo roles of this conserved protein in metazoan biology Worms homozygous for an null mutation are viable allowing us to demonstrate in vivo requirements for in meiotic recombination and DNA repair In mutants meiotic crossovers are not detected and oocyte chromosomes lack chiasmata but appear otherwise intact of mutant germ cells during meiotic prophase eliminates progeny survivorship and induces chromosome fragmentation and other cytologically visible abnormalities indicating a defect in repair of chromosome damage Whereas mutant germ cells are they retain function of the meiotic G 2 DNA damage checkpoint that triggers germ cell apoptosis in response to ionizing radiation Although animals derived from heterozygous parents are viable and produce many embryos there is a marked drop both in the number and survivorship of embryos produced by succeeding generations This progressive loss of fecundity and viability indicates that performs a function essential for maintaining reproductive

family member mutant oocytes lack chiasmata between homologous chromosomes and crossover frequencies are severely reduced in both oocyte and spermatocyte meiosis Artificially induced DNA breaks do not bypass the requirement for suggesting that functions after the initiation step of meiotic recombination mutants are apparently competent to repair breaks induced during meiosis but accomplish repair in a way that does not lead to crossovers between homologs These results combine with data from budding yeast to establish a conserved role for Msh5 proteins in promoting the crossover outcome of meiotic recombination events Apart from the crossover deficit progression through meiotic prophase is largely unperturbed in mutants Homologous chromosomes are fully aligned at the pachytene stage and germ cells survive to complete meiosis and gametogenesis with high efficiency Our demonstration that artificially induced breaks generate crossovers and chiasmata using the normal meiotic recombination machinery suggests 1 that association of breaks with a preinitiation complex is not a prerequisite for entering the meiotic recombination pathway and 2 that the decision for a subset of recombination events to become crossovers is made after the initiation step View details for Web of Science ID 000089766800014 View details for PubMedID 11014811 cosuppression in the germ line GENES

demonstrate the generality of and define rules for a cosuppression phenomenon in the Caenorhabditis elegans germ line Functional repression is not a consequence of persistent physical association between transgenes and endogenous genes or of mutations in affected genes The cosuppression mechanism likely involves an RNA mediator that defines its target specificity reminiscent of RNAi

encodes a member of the MutS family of DNA mismatch repair MMR proteins has no apparent role in MMR but like its Saccharomyces cerevisiae ortholog MSH4 has a specialized role in promoting crossing over during meiosis Despite this conservation worms and yeast differ significantly in their reliance on this pathway whereas worms use this pathway to generate most if not all crossovers yeast still form of their normal number of crossovers when this pathway is absent This differential reliance may reflect differential stability of recombination intermediates or alternatively the presence of two

chromosome synapsis CELL Dernburg McDonald Moulder Barstead Dresser Villeneuve 1998 94 3 Abstract Chromosome segregation at meiosis I depends on pairing and between homologs In most eukaryotes pairing culminates with formation of the proteinaceous synaptonemal complex SC In budding yeast recombination initiates through DNA breaks DSBs and is thought to be essential for SC formation Here we examine whether this mechanism for initiating meiotic recombination is conserved and we test the dependence of homologous chromosome synapsis on recombination in elegans We find that a homolog of the yeast enzyme Spo11p is required for meiotic exchange in this metazoan and that breaks partially alleviate this dependence Thus initiation of recombination by DSBs is apparently conserved However homologous synapsis is independent of recombination in the nematode since it occurs normally in a elegans null mutant View details for Web of Science ID 000075308400014 View details for PubMedID 9708740

repeats TTAGGC n are sufficient for chromosome capping function in Caenorhabditis elegans PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA Wicky Villeneuve Lauper Codourey Tobler Muller 1996 93 17 Abstract Telomeres are specialized structures located at the ends of linear eukaryotic chromosomes that ensure their complete replication and protect them from fusion and degradation We report here the characterization of the telomeres of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans We show that the chromosomes terminate in kb of tandem repeats of the sequence TTAGGC Furthermore we have isolated clones corresponding to 11 of the 12 elegans telomeres Their subtelomeric sequences are all different from each other demonstrating that the terminal TTAGGC repeats are sufficient for general chromosomal capping functions Finally we demonstrate that the me8 meiotic mutant which is defective in X chromosome crossing over and segregation bears a terminal deficiency that was healed by the addition of telomeric repeats presumably by the activity of a telomerase enzyme The 11 cloned telomeres represent an important advance for the completion of the physical map and for the determination of the entire sequence of the elegans genome View details for Web of Science ID A1996VD43400037 View details for PubMedID 8799140 LOCUS THAT PROMOTES BETWEEN IN GENETICS Villeneuve 1994 136 3 Abstract This study reports the characterization of a locus on the Caenorhabditis elegans X chromosome that is crucial for promoting normal levels of crossing over specifically between the X homologs and for ensuring their proper disjunction at meiosis I The function of this locus is disrupted by the mutation me8 which maps to the extreme left end of the X chromosome within the region previously implicated by studies of X A translocations and X duplications to contain a meiotic pairing site Hermaphrodites homozygous for a deletion of the locus or heterozygous for a deletion and the me8 mutation exhibit extremely high level of X chromosome nondisjunction at the reductional division this is correlated with a sharp decrease in crossing over between the X homologs as evidenced both by reductions in genetic map distances and by the presence of achiasmate chromosomes in cytological preparations of oocyte nuclei Duplications of the region that are unlinked to the X chromosome can not complement the recombination and disjunction defects in trans indicating that this region must be present in cis to the X chromosome to ensure normal levels of crossing over and proper homolog disjunction me8 homozygotes exhibit an altered distribution of crossovers along the X chromosome that suggests a defect in processivity along the X chromosome of an event that initiates at the chromosome end Models are discussed in which the locus deleted by the Dfs functions as a meiotic pairing center that recruits factors onto the chromosomes to nucleate assembly of a complex between the X homologs This pairing center might function in the process of homolog recognition or in the initiation of homologous synapsis View details for Web of Science ID A1994MZ47400018 View
